    "body": "2 days agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US \"has to have\" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't \"gonna push back too much\". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato.President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Japan has suspended operations at the world's largest nuclear power plant, hours after its restart, its operator has said.An alarm sounded \"during reactor-start-up procedures\" at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in Tokyo but the reactor remained \"stable\", Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi said.Reactor number six restarted on Wednesday a day later than planned due to an alarm malfunction - the first at the plant to be turned on since the 2011 Fukushima disaster.Japan shut down all of its 54 reactors after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake triggered a meltdown at its Fukushima plant 15 years ago, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history.At the time, radiation leakage from the plant forced more than 150,000 people to evacuate their homes. Many have not returned despite assurances it is now safe.Following the suspension of reactor number six on Thursday, Kobayashi said it was \"stable and there is no radioactive impact outside\".The reactor was initially set to start on Tuesday, but was pushed back due to a technical issue. It is due to begin operating commercially next month.Kobayashi said Tepco was \"currently investigating the cause\" of the incident and did not say when operations would resume. The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be turned back on until 2030, while the other five could be decommissioned.This would leave the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational.Reactor number six was given the green light to restart despite safety concerns from local residents.A small crowd of people gathered outside Tepco's headquarters to protest last week, while hundreds gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly in December.Japan was an early adopter of nuclear power - before 2011, nuclear accounted for nearly 30% of its electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030.After it was forced to shut them all down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, it has spent the past decade attempting to revive the plants as part of its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050.Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors.",

    "body": "Shock and confusion as Spain struggles for answers after deadly train crash1 day agoGuy Hedgecoein Adamuz, southern SpainReutersSpain's King Felipe (far right) visited the crash site with Queen Letizia on TuesdaySunday's high-speed train crash in southern Spain, the worst in over a decade, has been a devastating tragedy for the country, with the loss of at least 42 lives.And amid the grief, many are asking what could have caused such a failure on one of Europe's most admired rail systems.The CIAF rail investigatory commission has started analysing why a train travelling north from Málaga was derailed on a straight section of the route, causing it to collide with an oncoming train, which was also derailed. The Spanish government has described the accident as \"extremely strange\".Three bodies already located in the wreckage were recovered on Tuesday afternoon, and a 42nd victim was also found at the crash site near Adamuz.The shock felt in this sleepy town has been compounded by confusion at how a rail route that ran efficiently for so long suddenly failed.After its inauguration in 1992, Spain's high-speed rail, or AVE, network was seen as a symbol of the country's modernisation. Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe.A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.Watch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decadeSeveral officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause.Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".EPAGrieving Spaniards want answers about what caused the deadly crashHowever, investigators are also examining the section of track where the derailment occurred and intend to analyse parts of it in a laboratory. The revelation that part of the track at the crash site was broken has encouraged speculation that this might be the culprit. The government has been keen to play down such conclusions, pointing out that the track may have been damaged by the force of the collision.Some observers have drawn attention to possible underlying factors on the network. It has emerged that rail infrastructure administrator Adif drew attention to eight technical issues on the line near where the accident happened on social media over the last year. Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150km (93 mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit.Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to \"fear for my safety and that of my daughter\".In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing \"a lack of comfort and reliability\" for those travelling. It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and \"to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers\".As a result of Sunday's crash, and the separate derailment of a Rodalies train which killed a driver near Barcelona on Tuesday, Semaf has called a strike. Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years.\"When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz.That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.",

    "body": "22 hours agoJames Waterhousein Córdoba, SpainBBC/Moose CampbellYamilei's brother-in-law Victor was among the victims of Sunday night's crashEduardo Morán, a doctor at Córdoba's Reina Sofía Hospital, suspected it was serious.He and his wife, also a medic, had been asked to head to work after reports that two high speed trains had collided nearby.\"We were preparing different parts of the hospital,\" he recalls. \"Not just the emergency room, but the intensive care unit, all the surgery theatres and the regular floor. Everybody was there.\"As the patients arrived, their injuries ranged from scratches to missing limbs. Staff prioritised who to treat. Some were operated on, others monitored.Eduardo had never seen such an influx of casualties in his 20-year career, and yet the hospital was not overwhelmed.\"We were expecting more,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, there were a lot of people who didn't make it and died on the railway.\"Social MediaAmong the victims was María del Carmen Abril, returning from a surprise birthday partyIn dense woodland 36 miles from Córdoba lies the tangled wreckage of the two trains that collided on Sunday evening.A gap in the straight section of track is thought to be what investigators are focusing on.At least 43 people lost their lives here, and as sniffer dogs weave between the empty seats and shattered windows, there is still a hunger to unearth answers as to what caused Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.As officials called for patience, news broke of a second derailment in almost as many days.Unlike Sunday night's disaster, the train that crashed near Barcelona was not a high-speed model, and the accident involved a wall that collapsed onto the track in heavy rain.Nevertheless, it has led to the Spanish train drivers' union calling a strike over the \"unacceptable constant deterioration of the railway\".For the families and friends of those missing and killed in southern Spain, these events have only added to their unanswered questions.BBC/Moose CampbellJose Manuel Muñoz lost his friend Abril in Sunday's high-speed rail crashThroughout Saturday afternoon and into the night in Córdoba, Jose Manuel Muñoz and his friends were holding a surprise 50th birthday party for María del Carmen Abril, a teacher.The party was barely over when Abril, as she is known, made her way back north to Madrid. She thanked her hosts on their WhatsApp group, and they later frantically replied to see if she was OK.Abril was sitting on one of the carriages that came off the tracks into an oncoming train. Her death was confirmed the next day.Carlos Alvarez/Getty ImagesAn Iryo train was the first to derail at Adamuz, crashing into an oncoming train\"It's very difficult to explain the contrast of emotions,\" says Muñoz, sitting in the tranquil surroundings of Córdoba's Jardines de la Victoria, a park next to his workshop where he makes picture frames.\"We spent one day celebrating life with our friend, then there were two days of uncertainty, without knowing anything about what happened to her, then we get the confirmation that she's dead.\"He describes Abril as a \"lovely, generous, affectionate person who loved flowers and was always trying to solve other people's problems\".And yet Muñoz does not blame anyone for her death; instead, he puts it down to bad luck.Under the low winter sun and next to the city's bull ring is Córdoba's Civic Centre. Outside are two makeshift tents where the families of the missing give DNA samples in the hope their relatives can at least be identified.BBC/Marianne BaisnéeYamilei shows a picture of her brother-in-law, Victor Luis TeránBecause of a last-minute change in travel plans, Jamilet's brother-in law, Victor Luis Terán, took an earlier train and became caught up in the crash as he travelled south from Madrid to Huelva.It was not until Tuesday night that confirmation came that Victor, a Bolivian national, was among the 43 victims.Yamilei is looking for answers: \"That's all we want. Because we can't do it any more.\"The truth she seeks is likely to take weeks to arrive, and official calls for patience have only been hampered by a devastating three days on Spain's rail network.Additional reporting by Marianne Baisnée and Marta Jimenez",

    "body": "16 hours agoThomas MackintoshandRachel HaganThe US military has begun the transfer up to 7,000 Islamic State (IS) group detainees from prisons in north-eastern Syria to Iraq, as Syria's new government takes control of areas long run autonomously by Kurdish-led forces.US Central Command (Centcom) said it had already moved 150 IS fighters from Hassakeh province to a \"secure location\" in Iraq.It said the move aimed to prevent prisoners breaking out and regrouping.The transfer follows a ceasefire agreement that has brought much of Syria's north east under Damascus control, after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) withdrew from key areas, including detention sites holding thousands of IS suspects and their relatives.CENTCOM said its commander Admiral Brad Cooper discussed the transfers with Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, stressing the need for Syrian forces to uphold the ceasefire and avoid any action that could interfere with what he described as an \"orderly and secure transfer\" of detainees.Rights group Reprieve warned that detainees transferred to Iraq could face torture and execution and urged the UK government to establish whether any British nationals were among those being moved.The charity said it believed there were no more than 10 British men held in the prisons, though exact numbers were unclear. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said.Despite the ceasefire there have been fresh clashes, with Syria's defence ministry saying seven soldiers were killed in a drone attack in Hassakeh on Wednesday, describing the incident a violation of the ceasefire.The SDF denied carrying out the strike and accused Damascus of also launching attacks, including near the town of Kobane on the Turkish border.The government and SDF had earlier blamed each other over the escape of suspected IS fighters from an SDF-run prison in Shaddadi, in southern Hassakeh.Syria's interior ministry said on Monday night that its special forces and army soldiers had entered the town following \"the escape of around 120 [IS] terrorists\" from the prison. It said security forces later recaptured 81 of the fugitives.The SDF said it had lost control of the prison following clashes with \"Damascus-affiliated factions\", warning of a \"serious security catastrophe\".SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members may have escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency. The SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is also holding IS members and leaders.The SDF helped US-led forces defeat IS during Syria's 13-year civil war and, backed by the US, went on to jail around 12,000 IS members, including thousands of foreigners, while detaining tens of thousands of relatives in camps across the north east.However US special envoy Tom Barrack has said the US alliance with the SDF had \"largely expired\" and that his country was currently focused on securing IS detention facilities and facilitating talks between the SDF and al-Sharaa's government.\"This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime,\" he wrote on X.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorUS President Donald Trump will meet Volodymyr Zelensky at Davos on Thursday, after his envoy Steve Witkoff expressed optimism about finalising a deal to end the war in Ukraine.\"I think we've got it down to one issue and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it's solvable,\" Witkoff said ahead of his trip to Moscow for talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin.Witkoff did not specify the single issue but recent talks have focused on the future status of Ukraine's industrial heartland in Donbas, with a proposal for a demilitarised and free economic zone in exchange for security guarantees for Kyiv.\"If both sides want to solve this we're going to get it solved,\" Witkoff said.Ahead of Witkoff's visit to Moscow with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the US president said: \"I think they're getting close; a lot of people are being killed, we've got to get it done.\"Last week, Trump said he thought Putin was \"ready to make a deal\" but that Zelensky was \"less ready\".The Ukrainian president travelled through the night to get to Davos on Thursday.He had initially called off his trip to deal with the aftermath of Russian strikes on Kyiv's power infrastructure which have left large areas of the capital without heating, water or power during the harshest winter so far in almost four years of Russia's full-scale war. Thousands of apartment blocks remain without heating.There has been concern in Kyiv that Trump's spat with his European Nato allies over the future of Greenland has deflected him from the war in Ukraine.Zelensky said after talks with Trump in Miami late last month that a 20-point US plan to end the war was 90% ready and that Ukraine's position on Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, was different to Russia's.Specifically, Zelensky has offered to withdraw troops from the 25% of Donetsk region that Ukraine still controls by up to 40km (25 miles), to create an economic zone, if Russia does the same. Russian forces have advanced slowly in the east in the past year and Putin is known to covet control of the entire region.The other big sticking point that Zelensky highlighted last month was future control of Ukraine's enormous Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, seized by Russia in March 2022.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that discussion with the American envoys would continue \"on the Ukrainian issue and other related topics\" and refused to say whether he shared Witkoff's optimism on achieving a deal.Putin has also not yet decided whether to join Trump's Board of Peace on Gaza.Ukraine's president had hoped to sign two key documents with Trump at Davos covering future security guarantees as well as economic prosperity, but said there was \"one mile left to finalise these documents\". It is not yet clear if any signings will take place during their meeting at the World Economic Forum.However, the head of Ukraine's national security and defence council, Rustem Umerov, said on Wednesday night that his team in Davos had discussed the issues of economic development, post-war recovery and security guarantees with their US counterparts.",

    "body": "Oldest cave painting of red claw hand could rewrite human creativity timeline21 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentA stencilled outline of a hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is the world's oldest known cave painting, researchers say.It shows a red outline of a hand whose fingers were reworked, researchers say, to create a claw-like motif which indicates an early leap in symbolic imagination.The painting has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago – around 1,100 years before the previous record, a controversial hand stencil in Spain.The find also strengthens the argument that our species, Homo sapiens, had reached the wider Australia–New Guinea landmass, known as Sahul, by around 15,000 years earlier than some researchers argue.Over the past decade, a series of discoveries on Sulawesi has overturned the old idea that art and abstract thinking in our species burst suddenly into life in Ice Age Europe and spread from there.Cave art is seen as a key marker of when humans began to think in truly abstract, symbolic ways – the kind of imagination that underpins language, religion and science.Early paintings and engravings show people not just reacting to the world, but representing it, sharing stories and identities in a way no other species is known to have done.Professor Adam Brumm of Griffiths University in Australia, who co-led the project, told BBC News, that the latest discovery, published in the journal Nature, adds to the emerging view that there was no awakening for humanity in Europe. Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved.\"When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain\".The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old. In 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University.\"We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years\".The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock.One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world.Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say.Ahdi Agus OktavianaMore recent elongated hand stencils found elsewhere in Suluwesi shows how prevalent the red claw image was among these ancient artists.After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is \"a very us thing to do\".  He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method.Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region.Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed \"hundreds of new rock art sites\" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years.Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived.For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN).\"It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia.\"Many archaeologists once argued for a European \"big bang\" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before.Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News.\"What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that\".Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Photos leaked to BBC show faces of hundreds killed in Iran's brutal protest crackdown1 day agoMerlyn Thomas,correspondent, BBC Verify,Shayan Sardarizadeh,senior journalist, BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,senior journalistBBCWarning: this story contains graphic content which some readers might find distressingHundreds of photos revealing the faces of those killed during Iran's violent crackdown on anti-government protests have been leaked to BBC Verify.The pictures, which are too graphic to show without blurring, reveal the bloodied, swollen and bruised faces of at least 326 victims - including 18 women. The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones.Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos.Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far.The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.Getty ImagesProtesters on a street in Tehran on 9 January BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as \"seditionists\".Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out.Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify.We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. \"It was just too much,\" they said.Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. Crowds of anti-government protesters in TehranThe slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.",

    "body": "16 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterReutersUS President Donald Trump appeared on course for a setback at America's top court on Wednesday over his unprecedented move to fire a central bank governor.Supreme Court justices from the left and right asked why they should speed through such an impactful decision, citing concerns about process and implications for central bank independence and the wider economy.  Trump in August said he was removing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which she has denied.Cook has argued she did not receive due process to dispute those claims, which Fed defenders say were a pretext to allow Trump to assert more control over the bank. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who was appointed by Trump, was among the justices to express sympathy with Cook's arguments, asking: \"What's the fear of more process here?\"He later warned the administration's interpretation of the law would \"weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve\".'Quite a big mistake'By law, a president can only remove governors of the Federal Reserve \"for cause\".That requirement was intended to shield the central bank from political pressure and allow it to make policy independently.The White House contends it has met that bar, accusing Cook of filing mortgage forms claiming two different principal residences at the same time. Banks typically offer lower interest rates for primary homes. The Trump administration has asked the court to allow the president to remove Cook, a move lower courts had blocked while the case played out. \"Even if it's inadvertent or a mistake, it's quite a big mistake,\" said solicitor general D John Sauer, who was arguing the case for the administration.He said such conduct could undermine confidence in the bank and that courts were bound to defer to the president's judgement when it comes to finding a cause. He dismissed questions about process, noting that Trump had alerted Cook to the issue on social media before formally firing her.\"There was a social media post,\" he said. \"And the response was defiance.\"'Nothing criminal whatsoever'Cook has denied committing fraud.In a November letter to the Justice Department, her lawyers said the claims were based on \"cherry-picked, incomplete snippets of the full documents\". They said there was \"one stray reference to primary residence\" in a mortgage application for an apartment in Alabama, but noted that the file also contained \"truthful and more specific disclosures about the property's use\".\"There is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud,\" her lawyers wrote.Arguing on behalf of Cook, Paul Clement said people in her position should have the chance to present their evidence and be shielded from having a decision made in advance. He said the administration's interpretation of the law would make the protection that Congress intended by inserting the \"for cause\" requirement \"toothless\".Some justices indicated that they shared those concerns. The \"position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines - that would weaken if not shatter the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Kavanaugh said. The lawsuit is seen as high stakes, given swirling debate about Trump's efforts to influence the Fed, which he wants to lower interest rates more aggressively to boost economic growth.Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was among the officials expected to attend. He is facing his own criminal probe related to cost overruns during renovations of Fed properties - concerns he has called \"pretexts\".In other recent cases, the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has allowed the White House to proceed with firings. But it has signalled that it views the Federal Reserve, which was designed to set policy independently from the White House, as different.In a statement after the hearing, Cook's lawyers said they were \"hopeful\" the court would recognise the importance of the Fed being able to operate free from political interference. In her own statement, Cook, who attended the hearing, said: \"This case is about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure. \"For as long as I serve at the Federal Reserve, I will uphold the principle of political independence in service to the American people.\"Several justices, including conservatives, indicated they were hesitant to greenlight Cook's removal without courts having resolved issues like whether the mortgage filings, which were made before Cook was appointed, would meet the bar for a \"for cause\" firing. \"We know that the independence of the agency is very important and that that independence is harmed if we decide these issues too quickly and without due consideration,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal. \"So to me, waiting to have at least the lower courts look at these issues first makes the most sense.\"\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody... in such a hurried manner?\" asked Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, pressed Sauer to explain what harm the president would suffer by waiting, noting that the court had been warned of potentially dire economic consequences of a decision that could weaken belief in the central bank's independence. \"There's a risk,\" she said. \"Doesn't that counsel... caution on our part?\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoBethany BellVienna correspondentReutersEgisto Ott is accused of collecting large amounts of data and handing information to Russian intelligenceFormer intelligence official Egisto Ott has gone on trial in Vienna on Thursday, accused of spying for Russia in what is being dubbed Austria's biggest spy trial in years.Egisto Ott, 63, is charged with having handed over information to Russian intelligence officers and to Jan Marsalek, the fugitive executive of collapsed German payments firm Wirecard.Ott denies the charges.Jan Marsalek, who is also an Austrian citizen, is wanted by German police for alleged fraud and is currently believed to be in Moscow, having fled via Austria in 2020.The subject of an Interpol Red Notice, he is alleged to be an intelligence asset for the FSB, Russia's secretive security service.The spy scandal has revived fears that Austria remains a hotbed of Russian espionage activity and observers will also be watching closely for details that could emerge about Marsalek.Prosecutors in Vienna say Egisto Ott \"abused his authority\" as an Austrian intelligence official by collecting large amounts of personal data, such as locations, vehicle registration numbers, or travel movements.They say he did this between 2015 and 2020 without authorisation, often using national and international police databases.Prosecutors also charge him with supporting \"a secret intelligence service of the Russian Federation to the detriment of the Republic of Austria\" by collecting secret facts and a large amount of personal data from police databases between 2017 and 2021.They say Egisto Ott gave this information to Jan Marsalek and unknown representatives of the Russian intelligence service, and received payment in return.In 2022, prosecutors say, Jan Marsalek commissioned him to obtain a laptop containing secret electronic security hardware used by EU states for secure electronic communication. The laptop, they say, was handed over to the Russian intelligence service.He is also suspected, reports say, of having passed phone data from senior Austrian interior ministry officials to Russia.Austria's Standard newspaper says Egisto Ott apparently obtained the work phones after they accidentally fell into the River Danube on an interior ministry boating trip. He is alleged to have copied their contents and passed them on to Jan Marsalek, and Moscow.Egisto Ott is charged with abuse of authority and corruption and espionage against Austria and faces up to five years in prison, if he is found guilty.When he was arrested in 2024, Austria's then Chancellor, Karl Nehammer, described the case as \"a threat to democracy and our country's national security\".Munich PoliceJan Marsalek, former executive at Wirecard, is believed to have escaped to MoscowIn a separate development, prosecutors in the Austrian town of Wiener Neustadt have told the BBC that a former MP, Thomas Schellenbacher, has been charged with helping Marsalek to escape following the collapse of the Wirecard company in 2020, when it emerged that €1.9bn was missing from its accounts.Schellenbacher is alleged to have helped Jan Marsalek fly to Belarus, from Bad Vöslau in Austria, in June 2020.Schellenbacher was an MP for the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), which has been accused by Austria's Green Party, now in opposition, of enabling Russian espionage, of acting as \"an extension of Russia's arm\" in Austria.The FPÖ and its leader Herbert Kickl have denied the allegations - and have not faced any legal action in connection with any of them.Marsalek, who was the Wirecard's Chief Operating Officer, has since been charged with fraud and embezzlement, suspected of having inflated company's balance sheet total and sales volume.He is also believed to have been the controller of a group of Bulgarians who were convicted in London in 2025, of spying for Russia.Messages from that trial reveal Marsalek has had plastic surgery to alter his appearance as well as details of his life as a fugitive.\"I'm off to bed. Had another cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently, and I am dead tired and my head hurts,\" he wrote to one of the Bulgarians, Roussev, on Telegram in February 2022.In another, dated 11 May 2021, Roussev congratulated Marsalek for learning Russian.\"Well I am trying to improve my skills on a few fronts. Languages is one of them,\" the Austrian responded.\"In my new role as an international fugitive I must outperform James Bond.\"",

    "body": "21 hours agoJohn SudworthJerusalemBBC NewsThe Aida Youth Centre's pitch sits next to the barrier separating the occupied West Bank from IsraelIsrael has postponed the demolition of a Palestinian children's football club in the city of Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank.It said the Aida Youth Centre's pitch was constructed without the necessary permits. It said the demolition was necessary for security reasons. An international campaign to save it, including a petition with more than half a million signatures, appears to have forced the authorities to reconsider. The club, however, said it had not yet received any official notification.It is barely a 10th of the size of a full-scale football field, there are patches of rust on the goalposts and, towering over the length of one of the touchlines, the architecture of conflict looms large in Israel's concrete security barrier.But while it may not rank high up among the world's iconic sporting venues, this children's football club has found itself at the centre of a hard-fought international campaign for its survival.And despite the asymmetrical odds as it took on the Israeli state, that campaign appears - for now at least - to have worked.The club has won a reprieve against the threat of demolition by the Israeli military, which claimed that the pitch was far too close to the barrier.On the very northern edge of Bethlehem, construction of the pitch began in 2020 with the aim of providing a place to practise football for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp.The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.The notice was followed by a demolition order, issued at the end of December.\"We don't have anywhere else to play, 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.\"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\"I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.\"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\"The community fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures as well as the reported interventions of senior officials from some of football's global and regional governing bodies.In its latest statement, the Israeli military repeated its claim that the football pitch, built so close to the wall, posed a security issue.But the BBC understands that a political decision has been made to postpone the demolition order \"for the time being\".Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.It says it is vital for Israel's protection and that it has dramatically cut the number of attacks.Palestinians, however, say that it has become a tool of collective punishment, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.For them, the fight over the football pitch highlights a wider injustice.While they are being denied the right to keep a small sporting facility on the boundary of one of their cities, Israel is approving vast new settlements across the occupied West Bank and which are considered illegal under international law.The immediate threat may now have been averted for the football pitch.But the club is taking nothing for granted.Mohammad Abu Srour, one of the board members of the Aida Youth Centre, told me that they feared that the threat might come back when the club is out of the spotlight.\"We're going to continue to campaign,\" he told me.",

    "body": "57 minutes agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlineRafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González, has been released from prison, his wife has said, more than a year after he was detained as part of a crackdown on Maduro government critics and their relatives.Mariana González said her husband had returned home after \"380 days of unjust and arbitrary detention\".Tudares is one of more than 150 detainees who have been released since the US military seized Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, in a nighttime raid and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges.An NGO lobbying for the release of Venezuelan political prisoners warns that 777 still remain behind bars.Tension within the country remains high with Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, now in power having been sworn in as the acting president.Her interim government has received the backing of US President Donald Trump, who has praised Rodríguez for agreeing to \"turn over\" up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the US.The release of political prisoners had been among the first things the Trump administration had pushed Venezuela's interim government to do.Just five days after the US raid, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that \"an important number of people\" would be freed as \"a gesture of peace\".However, rights groups have denounced the slow pace of the releases and the fact that the number given by officials - 400 - falls far short of what they have been able to confirm. The NGO Foro Penal says it has so far only been able to verify the release of 151 political prisoners since 8 January, when the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that \"an important number of people\" would be freed as \"a gesture of peace\" following the US operation.Foro Penal has also said that many those released have not had the charges against them dropped, leaving them in legal limbo, and have been barred from speaking in public. Tudares's imprisonment was one of the emblematic cases of the repression which followed in the wake of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election.His father-in-law, González, became the main challenger of the incumbent Maduro after the well-known opposition leader María Corina Machado was barred from running.Fearing the Maduro government would resort to fraud to rig the result, González and Machado mobilised hundreds of people to act as observers at the polling stations and collect the tallies from the electronic voting machines. The electoral council, dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner but never provided the detailed voting tallies to back up its claim.The voting tallies collected by the observers deployed by the opposition and independently verified by the Carter Center, however, suggested that González had won by a landslide. Nevertheless, Maduro - who was firmly in control of the state institutions, including the armed forces and the police - was sworn in for another term in January 2025.In the run-up to his inauguration, many opposition leaders and activists were seized by the security forces in an attempt to stifle any dissent.Fearing arrest, González had sought refuge in the Dutch embassy as early as September 2024 and gone in to exile in Spain shortly afterwards.Three days before Maduro's inauguration, González's 46-year-old son-in-law - a lawyer who was not involved in politics - was seized by hooded men as he was taking his young children to see their ailing grandmother. For months, his family did not know where he was being held or on what grounds he had been seized.Last month, his wife said she had learned that he had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for \"terrorism and conspiracy\". She said her access was not allowed to choose a lawyer and had only been allowed to read the charges levelled against him on the day of his \"only hearing\".Mariana González told El Pais newspaper that she had been approached on at least three occasions by middlemen who told her that her husband would only be allowed to return to his family if her father renounced his cause. \"This has nothing to do with justice,\" she said at the time. \"Being the son-in-law of Edmundo González is not a crime,\" she added.Mariana González took to X to thank all of the people who had supported her in her fight for her husband's release. But she also reminded readers that there were still many families waiting for the release of their loved ones who, she said, had been \"forcibly disappeared, arbitrarily detained and unjustly locked up.Many of them have been holding vigils outside the main prisons in Venezuela in the hope that their relatives will be among those released in the wake of the US military raid.",

    "body": "16 hours agoDavid GrittenandDan Johnson,JerusalemThree Palestinian journalists have been killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza, first responders say.Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said their car was hit in the al-Zahra area and named them as Mohammed Salah Qashta, Anas Ghneim and Abdul Raouf Shaat. They are understood to have been working for an Egyptian relief organisation.The Israeli military said it struck \"several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas... in a manner that posed a threat\" to its troops. It added that the incident was under examination.Another eight people, two of them children, were killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire across Gaza on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.Medics said three people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli tank fire elsewhere in central Gaza, and that a 13-year-old boy and a woman were killed by Israeli gunfire in the southern Khan Younis area, according to Reuters news agency.The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning that its troops had killed a \"terrorist who crossed the Yellow Line and approached\" them, without mentioning a location. The Yellow Line demarcates territory in Gaza still under Israeli control under the ceasefire deal.At least 466 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on 10 October, according to the health ministry.The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups over the same period.The three photojournalists killed on Wednesday were reportedly working for the Egyptian Relief Committee in the Gaza Strip to film its camps for displaced people.A spokesperson for the humanitarian organisation said the car that was struck was marked with its logo and that it was \"targeted during a humanitarian mission, resulting in the martyrdom of three individuals\".Hamas called the strike a \"dangerous escalation of the flagrant violations of the ceasefire agreement\".The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said it constituted a war crime and evidence of what it called \"a systematic Israeli policy aimed at silencing the Palestinian voice, obstructing the transmission of facts, and concealing crimes committed against civilians\", according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.Abdul Raouf Shaat was regular contributor to French news agency AFP, which expressed \"immense sadness\" at his death and demanded a \"full and transparent investigation\".The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also said it was \"appalled\".\"Israel, which possesses advanced technology capable of identifying its targets, has an obligation under international law to protect journalists,\" regional director Sara Qudah said.The CPJ has documented the killing of at least 206 journalists and media workers by Israeli fire in Gaza since the start of the war - the deadliest conflict for journalists ever documented.Before Wednesday, two journalists had been killed in Israeli strikes during the ceasefire, and a third had been killed by members of a Palestinian armed group, according to the US-based organisation's data.International news outlets, including the BBC, rely on local journalists in Gaza, as Israel does not allow them to send foreign journalists into the territory independently. Some journalists are taken into Gaza by the Israeli military under controlled access.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,550 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

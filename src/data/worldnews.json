    "body": "Three shark attacks have been reported in Sydney in a little over 24 hours, leaving at least two people seriously injured, according to local authorities.A man was taken to hospital in critical condition after being injured at Manly beach on Monday evening, New South Wales Police said in a statement.Hours earlier, an 11-year-old surfer had to be assisted off Sydney's Dee Why Beach after a suspected shark bit his surfboard, with the local council urging swimmers and surfers to be cautious.The first incident saw a 12-year-old boy taken to hospital with critical injuries after he was attacked by a large shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon, police said.The boy and his group of friends were jumping off a six-metre rock ledge at Shark Beach, in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse, when the attack happened on Sunday.Despite its name, shark attacks are rare at Shark Beach, a popular swimming spot.The boy was pulled out of the water by his friends before rescuers arrived. Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,\" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.\"Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.\"Marine police arrived to a \"horrendous scene\", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least five fatal shark attacks in the country last year.",

    "description": "The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence ",
    "body": "The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence to criticise \"lies\" about their clients. Jessica and Jacques Moretti were  \"devastated\", the lawyers told local media, but denied being aware of any dangers at their venue.\"There is a sort of public vindictiveness directed against them,\" one of the three lawyers, Yaël Hayat, said.Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling of the basement of Le Constellation bar in the popular ski resort of Crans-Montana. Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are being treated in hospital for severe burns.Many stories about the couple, the venue they managed, as well as their past have circulated in the local media since the fire, increasing pressure on the authorities as they investigate the accident and prosecute the owners.In an interview with Tribune de Geneve, the lawyers said the couple wanted to \"restore the truth\".Hayat said reports her client Jessica had left the burning building with cash from the register were a lie, telling BFMTV: \"In no way did she leave the scene in a hurry; she stayed there to help and support the injured.\"Patrick Michod, representing Jacques Moretti, said: \"When you run an establishment and a tragedy like this occurs, you feel responsible. Now, the major question in this case is the question of criminal responsibility, which is obviously not the same thing as the feelings one may have as the operator.\"Asked about the foam in the ceiling, Michod said his client obtained the material from a \"major construction retailer\" which did not disclose that it was flammable. \"He did not want to install a highly flammable foam. He wanted to install acoustic foam,\" he said. Lawyers representing the family of Cyane Panine, a staff member at Le Constellation who died in the blaze, said she had received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught fire. Hayat described Panine as a close friend of the couple, and pulled out a postcard she said had been written by her to the Morettis, Tribune de Geneve reported. \"I hope I will continue to grow alongside you and that we will spend many more New Year's Eves together [...] you are like my second family,\" the postcard said.The Moretti couple have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Last week, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued the couple present a flight risk and have asked judges to impose a 400,000-franc bail ($500,000; £374,000)as a condition for their release - 200,000 for each.Michod said that he had filed a request to release Jacques Moretti.

The blast happened at around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) Sunday at Baogang United Steel plant in Inner Mongolia, causing noticeable tremors in the area.Footage online showed the explosion sending large plumes of smoke into the sky, while the ground was littered with debris, including collapsed ceilings and pipes. Five among the dozens hospitalised suffered serious injuries, state media reported. Authorities are investigating the cause of the blast.Baogang United Steel is a major state-owned iron and steel enterprise.China has a long history of industrial accidents, from factory explosions and mine collapses to mudslides.In 2015, two massive explosions in the port of Tianjin killed 173 people, leaving hundreds more injured and devastating large areas of the city.In May last year, an explosion in a chemical plant in the eastern province of Shandong killed five people and injured at least 19.

    "body": "4 hours agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsWatch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decadeSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has promised to get to the bottom of why two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain killing at least 40 people, as rescuers continue to search the wreckage.After visiting the site of the crash, Sanchez also announced three days of national mourning for victims.More than 120 more people were injured as carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening.The crash is the worst the country has seen in more than a decade.Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, according to Transport Minister Óscar Puente. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Sanchez visited the site of the crash with senior officials on Monday afternoon.\"This is a day of sorrow for all of Spain, for our entire country,\" he told reporters.\"We are going to get to the truth, we are going to find the answer, and when that answer about the origin and cause of this tragedy is known, as it could not be otherwise, with absolute transparency and absolute clarity, we will make it public.\"Puente said an investigation could take at least a month, describing the incident as \"extremely strange\".ReutersRescuers are still searching the wreckage at the crash siteEPAPedro Sánchez travelled to Spain to pay tribute to the people killedBut Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed source briefed on initial investigations as saying experts had found a faulty joint on the rails, which was causing a gap between rail sections to widen as trains travelled over it. They added that the joint was key to identifying the cause of the accident.Spain's El País newspaper said it was not clear whether the fault was a cause or a result of the crash.Four hundred passengers and staff were on board the two trains, the rail authorities said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 41, including children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 are in intensive care.Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\". Officials are working to identify the dead.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters.Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\".\"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"All high-speed services between Madrid and the southern cities of Malaga, Cordoba, Sevilla and Huelva have been suspended until Friday.Watch: Footage inside Spanish train as passengers evacuate from crashKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\" and offered their \"most heartfelt condolences\". The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country. Adif data shows the Spanish rail is more than 4,000km long (2,485 miles).",

    "body": "1 day agoNick BeakeEurope correspondent, in BrusselsIt's not yet a full year since European leaders buckled up for President Trump's second term, and now this rollercoaster ride feels it has reached its most dangerous turn yet.The occupant on the White House is dangling the threat of economic punishment over the heads of countries that are supporting the territorial integrity of an EU member, Denmark. Leaders will hold an emergency EU summit about this in the coming days. If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US.If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force?French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's \"trade bazooka\" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts.There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power.They were thinking of China, not the US.In the here and now, some EU leaders are wary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump.She has spoken of a \"problem of understanding and communication\" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood.If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat.Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis.Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts.It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it.EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous.Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic.But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.",

Boric said the death toll was expected to increase.The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.Local media have shown pictures of charred cars in the streets.Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío.The fires have burnt through 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) in the two regions so far.\"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe\" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X.\"All resources are available,\" he added.Under a state of catastrophe, Chile's armed forces can be deployed to help.The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000.Strong winds have fanned the flames, exacerbated by high summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts.Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the coming days.Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought.Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.",

    "body": "China's birth rates sunk to a record low in 2025, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost it, as the country's population fell for the fourth straight year.Government data on Monday showed that the country's birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968.Its population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year.Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children.In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021.More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.",

    "body": "Thirteen school pupils have died in South Africa after the minibus they were travelling in collided with a lorry south of the city of Johannesburg.The crash happened on Monday morning at around 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) in Vanderbijlpark, the local education authority said.Eleven students died at the scene, while two succumbed to their injuries later on. Two other pupils remains in critical condition.The minibus driver crashed into the lorry after attempting to overtake two vehicles, police spokesperson Mavela Masondo said.Masondo added that a case of culpable homicide would be opened.The minibus driver was \"reportedly\" being treated in hospital, Gauteng province's department of education said, while the details of what happened to the lorry driver were \"uncertain\".Fatal road collisions are common in South Africa, due to factors such as rampant speeding, reckless driving and poorly maintained vehicles.In 2025, 11,418 people died in crashes - about 6% lower than a year earlier but still equivalent to an average of 31 deaths a day.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Monday's crash \"distressing\". \"Our children are the nation's most precious assets and we must do all we can – from observing the rules of the road to the quality of service providers appointed to transport scholars – to protect learners,\" the president added.",

    "body": "2 hours agoThomas MackintoshAFP via Getty ImagesKaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc has \"no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".Donald Trump has vowed to \"100%\" follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on European countries who oppose his demand to take control of Greenland.European allies have rallied around Greenland's sovereignty. Denmark's foreign minister emphasised the US president cannot threaten his way to ownership of the semi-autonomous Danish territory.UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated the UK's position that the future of Greenland is for \"Greenlanders and for the Danes alone\" to decide.On Monday, Trump declined to rule out the use of force and insisted he would press ahead with the threatened tariffs on goods arriving in the US from the UK and seven other Nato-allied countries.Asked by NBC News if he would use force to seize Greenland, Trump answered: \"No comment\".The US president said he would charge Britain a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark.Trump said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland - all of whom are members of the defence alliance Nato which was founded in 1949.Asked if he will follow through on the tariff threat, Mr Trump told NBC News: \"I will, 100%.\"AFP via Getty ImagesTrump added: \"Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them... That's what Europe should focus on - not Greenland.\"Denmark has warned that US military action in Greenland would spell the end of Nato. In recent days, Greenland has received support from European members of the alliance - some even sent a handful of troops to Greenland last week in a move seen as symbolic.However, Trump followed that deployment with an announcement to impose tariffs on the eight Nato allies.Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Europe had to show President Trump tariff threats were \"not the way forward\".\"We have red lines that can't be crossed,\" he told Sky News. \"You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland. I have no intention of escalating this situation.\"Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said the alliance will keep working with Denmark and Greenland on the security of the Arctic.The European Union is to hold an emergency summit in Brussels for its leaders on Thursday where they will discuss how to respond to Trump's latest threat to take over Greenland.Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc has \"no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".\"But trades threats are not the way to go about this,\" Kallas added. \"Sovereignty is not for trade.\"It comes as text exchanges between Trump and the Norwegian prime minister were released - showing that on Sunday the US president blamed Norway for the fact he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize.In his reply - seen by the BBC - Jonas Gahr Støre explained that an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awards the prize which last October went to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado.\"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,\" Støre added.Trump also addressed the text message exchange in Monday's interview and said: \"Norway totally controls it [the Nobel Prize] despite what they say.\"They like to say they have nothing to do with it, but they have everything to do with it.\"Meanwhile, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) on Monday announced that multiple aircraft are on their way to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland. The joint US-Canada military defence organisation stressed they are part of a routine operation \"to support various long-planned Norad activities\", and said they had been  coordinated with Denmark and that the government of Greenland had been informed.Similar Norad operations at the base took place in 2022, 2023, and last year.

    "body": "4 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosandAlicia CurryReutersAt least 40 people have died and dozens more have been injured after two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, local authorities have said.The incident near the city of Córdoba has been described by local officials as Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the scene on Monday, where he announced a three-day mourning period.Here's what we know about the incident so far.Follow live updatesWhere did the crash happen?The crash occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid.The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said.It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added.What caused the crash?Watch: Footage inside Spanish train as passengers evacuateWhat caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.Puente has described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error.Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it.He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. Fernández Heredia suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause.Meanwhile, at a news conference during his visit to Adamuz, Prime Minister Sánchez vowed to uncover the cause of the crash and thanked emergency workers  for their help \"in a moment of such pain and tragedy\".Are people still trapped in the trains?Spanish Guardia Civil / Handout via ReutersThe Spanish Civil Guard arrived on scene to assess the situation and begin the evaluation processThere were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Renfe, according to a statement from Renfe.It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. \"The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,\" Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.\"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,\" he added.The president of the Andalusian regional government, Juanma Moreno, told local outlet Canal Sur that they are waiting for \"heavy machinery\" to \"practically lift\" parts of the second train, which \"has taken the worst part of this accident\".\"Until the heavy machinery can do its job and free the wagons from the track\", emergency services will not be able to start \"searching and identifying\" any remaining victims, he added.Who are the victims?The 39 victims of the crash have not yet been identified, with Puente saying the death toll \"is not yet final\" as investigations into the crash commence.As of Monday afternoon, 122 people had received medical assistance, 48 of whom remained hospitalised, local emergency services said.Among the 48 victims still in hospital, five are under the age of 18.Moreno said teams are working to identify those who have died. What have the survivors said?Spain train crash survivors describe 'absolutely terrifying' scenePassengers on board the Madrid-bound train described the moment of impact feeling like an \"earthquake\" and said it shattered the train's windows, displaced luggage and threw people to the floor. \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" journalist Salvador Jimenez told Canal Sur.\"There were people screaming, calling for doctors,\" he added.Another passenger, Lucas Meriako, told Spanish broadcaster La Sexta Noticias he was in the fifth carriage of the same train when he started to \"feel some banging\" that got louder and louder.\"Another train passed us and everything started vibrating. There was a jolt behind us and the feeling that the whole train was going to fall apart,\" he described.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSteve RosenbergRussia EditorReutersListen to Donald Trump and you would think Moscow and Beijing were lying in wait off the coast of Greenland, ready to pounce to boost their power in the Arctic.\"There are Russian destroyers, there are Chinese destroyers and, bigger, there are Russian submarines all over the place,\" President Trump said recently.That is why, according to America's president, US control of Greenland is essential.So how do you think Moscow has reacted to its alleged plot being uncovered and potentially thwarted by a US takeover of Greenland?The Russians can't be pleased. Right?Wrong.In an astonishing article, the Russian government paper is full of praise for Trump and critical of European leaders who oppose a US annexation of Greenland.\"Standing in the way of the US president's historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on 'drowning' the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life.\"\"Greatest deal\"? The reporter explains what he means. I have to keep reminding myself I am reading the Russian government newspaper, not a pro-Trump publication in America.\"If Trump annexes Greenland by July 4 2026, when America celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, he will go down in history as a figure who asserted the greatness of the United States,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"With Greenland, the US becomes the second largest country in the world after Russia, surpassing Canada in area. For Americans, that's on par with such planetary events as the abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 or the territorial conquests of the Napoleonic Wars.\"If, thanks to Trump, Greenland becomes part of America…for sure the American people will not forget such an achievement.\"And the Russian reporter has this message for America's president: don't U-turn.\"It is dangerous for the American president to back down over Greenland. This would weaken the position of the Republican Party in the midterm elections and likely result in a Democrat majority on Capitol Hill with the ensuing consequences for Trump. Whereas a rapid annexation of Greenland before the elections can change this political trend.\"In other words, it's in Trump's interest to push ahead with his plans to take over Greenland: according to the Russian government paper.Let that sink in.But why the praise from Moscow? Why the apparent encouragement?It's because Russia has much to gain from the current situation.Trump's fixation with Greenland, his determination to take over the island and impose tariffs on European countries that oppose his plan have put a huge strain on the transatlantic alliance: both on America's relations with Europe, and within Nato.Anything that weakens – or threatens to split – the Western alliance is viewed by Moscow as a huge positive for Russia.\"Europe is at a total loss and, to be honest, it's a pleasure to watch this,\" gloated the Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets in one of its articles about Greenland.What's more, American threats to annex Greenland are being used by pro-Kremlin commentators to try to justify Russia's war on Ukraine.Victory in Ukraine remains the Kremlin's priority. Moscow believes that maintaining a positive relationship with the Trump administration will help achieve this.Hence Russia's criticism of Europe. But not of Donald Trump.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here.

    "body": "4 hours agoDavid GrittenandRachel HaganReutersSyria's army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance have reported fresh clashes in the country's north-east, a day after a ceasefire deal brought much of the autonomous region under government control.The 14-point agreement signed on Sunday, which will see the SDF withdraw from Raqqa and Deir al-Zour provinces and then be integrated into state institutions, was supposed to end almost two weeks of fighting.President Ahmed al-Sharaa said he hoped it would allow Syria to \"end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress\".SDF commander Mazlum Abdi said the fighting had been \"imposed on us\" and that he had accepted the deal \"to stop the bloodshed\".Abdi added that he would explain the terms after returning from Damascus, where he was expected to fly on Monday for talks on implementation.It appears to be a major blow for the SDF, which had been reluctant to give up the autonomy it won for Syria's Kurdish minority when helping US-led forces defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) during the country's 13-year civil war.Sharaa has vowed to reunify Syria since he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, but the country remains deeply divided and has been rocked by several waves of deadly sectarian violence.On Monday, Syrian government forces advanced deep into northern and eastern areas previously controlled by the SDF.In the afternoon, the army announced that it had entered Shaddadi, in Hassakeh province, following what it alleged was the SDF's decision to release a number of detained IS members from the town's prison, according to state news agency Sana.The army said it had contacted mediators and the SDF to discuss an organised handover of the prison, but that the SDF's leadership had \"refused\". Soldiers would not take the necessary measures to restore security and apprehend the escapees, it added.The SDF said Shaddadi prison had \"fallen outside the control of our forces\" following repeated attacks by \"factions affiliated with Damascus\" since the early hours of the day. Dozens of SDF fighters had been killed as they tried \"to prevent a serious security catastrophe\", it added.The SDF also reported that clashes were continuing around another prison holding IS members, al-Aqtan in Raqqa, where it said nine of its fighters had been killed.Earlier, the army said three soldiers had been killed in two attacks by \"terrorist groups\" in the north-eastern Jazira region. It alleged that members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades and has a long-running association with the SDF, were attempting to disrupt the ceasefire and \"remnants of the former regime\".The interior ministry also said its forces had begun deploying to Deir al-Zour province as \"part of a broader security plan aimed at protecting civilians and property\".Dozens of government military vehicles were seen crossing a bridge to the eastern bank of the River Euphrates along with cars, lorries and motorcycles.Safia Keddo, a 49-year-old teacher who was making her way on foot, told AFP news agency: \"The past few years have been very difficult... Today we must turn the page\".\"We want children to return to school without fear, and for electricity, water, and bread to be restored. We're not asking for a miracle; we just want stability and a normal life.\"Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty ImagesPresident Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to enter all regions and manage their affairsOn Sunday evening, the government and SDF agreed an immediate ceasefire on all fronts across the country, which the president hailed as a \"victory for all Syrians\".\"The Syrian state is unified and centralised in decision-making, and its institutions will enter all Syrian territories and manage all regional affairs,\" Sharaa told a news conference, according to Sana. \"In areas with special characteristics, security personnel will be appointed from local residents.\"He also urged Arab tribes living in Raqqa and Deir al-Zour to \"maintain calm and allow the implementation of the agreement\".Before he left for Damascus, the SDF's commander said it had accepted a ceasefire agreement following an \"intense war\" in which many of its fighters had been killed or wounded since 6 January.\"This war was imposed on us. We wanted to prevent it, but unfortunately, because it was planned by many forces, it was imposed on us,\" Abdi said in a statement on Kurdish TV.EPASyrian security forces took control of the al-Omar oil field after the SDF withdrewAccording to Sana, the deal stipulates that the SDF will immediately hand over administrative and military control of Deir al-Zour and Raqqa provinces to the government, including all civilian institutions and facilities.It says the government will take control of all border crossings, oil and gas fields, and prisons and camps where captured IS fighters and their family members and other affiliated civilians are detained.It also says that the SDF's military and security forces will withdraw to Hassakeh province, where they will be fully integrated into the ministries of defence and interior \"on an 'individual' basis\" - not as separate Kurdish units, as the SDF had demanded.The agreement also welcomes a decree issued by the president on Friday which recognised Syrian Kurds as an \"integral and original\" component of the Syrian people.The decree affirmed their cultural, linguistic and civil rights, including designating Kurdish as a national language, which will allow its teaching at schools in Kurdish-majority areas, granting Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declaring the Nowruz spring festival as a paid national holiday.The agreement also commits the SDF to expelling all non-Syrian members of the PKK and reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against IS.US special envoy Tom Barrack said the deal represented \"a pivotal inflection point, where former adversaries embrace partnership over division\".\"The challenging work of finalising the details of a comprehensive integration agreement begins now, and the United States stands firmly behind this process at every stage - as we safeguard our vital national security interests in defeating [IS] remnants and advance President Trump's bold Middle East Peace Plan,\" he added.The agreement followed months of stalled negotiations over a March 2025 integration deal, which both sides had accused each other of trying to derail.Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.",

    "body": "10 hours agoThomas Naadi,BBC Africa, Accra andJean OtalorCyber Security AuthorityThe authorities released pictures of some of those found in the raids along with their equipmentGhana's security forces have arrested nine Nigerians suspected of co-ordinating a host of cyber-crime activities from makeshift offices in and around the capital, Accra.Forty-four others, believed to be victims brought to Ghana from Nigeria under false pretences, have also been detained and handed over to the immigration authority.During the two-day intelligence-led operation, raids uncovered 62 laptops, 52 mobile phones and two pump-action guns, the authorities have said.There is a growing trend of foreigners being lured to Ghana under the pretext of lucrative work. They are then put in gated compounds, have their documents confiscated and are compelled to engage in cyber-crime.They often work on romance scams, where a victim is encouraged to send money to a fictitious partner who they believe is real, or business email compromise, where someone poses as an employer and gets people to sends funds or sensitive data.The weekend's operation was jointly co-ordinated by a host of agencies, including the Cyber Security Authority (CSA).''All the arrested individuals have been duly profiled and handed over to the Ghana Immigration Service for safekeeping and further investigations,\" Communications Minister Sam George said in a post on X.\"We caution foreign nationals invited to Ghana to verify claims made by their fellow nationals to lure them here.''George also indicated that suspects arrested in previous recent operations have been handed over to Nigerian law enforcement or are facing prosecution.The CSA and other agencies have been making efforts to flush out cyber-criminals, including working with the US authorities to arrest high-profile suspects. Among recent operations was the arrest of a popular Ghanaian social media influencer known as Abu Trica, whose real name is Frederick Kumi, who allegedly stole $8m (£5.9m) from vulnerable Americans through a romance scam. He has not yet commented on the allegations.Another successful operation was the dismantling of a syndicate that defrauded over 200 victims of $400,000 (£300,000).You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcastsMore from the BBC",

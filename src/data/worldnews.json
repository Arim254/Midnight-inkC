    "body": "<div><p>Australian officials have promised telecommunications giant Optus will face \"significant consequences\" over a systems outage linked to multiple deaths.</p><p>The incident last week left hundreds of people across more than half of the country unable to call emergency services for 13 hours.</p><p>Optus - one of the country's two major providers - says at least three people died as a result, and its chief executive has apologised to their families and the public for the \"completely unacceptable\" failure.</p><p>The company is under fire for its delayed handling of the incident - the second such outage for the firm in two years - and the nation's communications regulator is investigating.</p></div><div><p>More than 600 calls to emergency services failed last Thursday, primarily coming from South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. At least two calls to triple-0 made from south-western New South Wales also did not connect.</p><p>However Optus waited 40 hours to inform the public about the incident, and also did not tell regulators until the issue was resolved - counter to standard practice, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) says.</p><p>In a press conference on Friday afternoon, Optus boss Stephen Rue blamed the outage on a technical fault identified during a network upgrade.</p><p>He said welfare checks conducted after services were restored confirmed three people had died, including a baby boy, though police have since said the network failure was \"unlikely\" to be a cause in that case. Authorities in WA also say they believe a fourth person died after their call to triple-0 failed.</p><p>In a series of updates over the weekend, Mr Rue said the company was unaware of the incident for 13 hours. Multiple customers had tried to advise the company its network wasn't working, but the complaints weren't escalated or handled \"as would be expected\", he said.</p><p>\"I would like to reiterate how sorry I am about the very sad loss of the lives of four people who could not reach emergency services in their time of need,\" Mr Rue said on Sunday.</p><p>\"What I can assure you is that actions are and will be taken to ensure this does not happen in future.\"</p><p>In a statement, an Acma spokesperson said the regulator was \"deeply concerned\" by the situation and its handling.</p><p>\"Australians must be able to contact emergency services whenever they need help. This is the most fundamental responsibility every telco provider has to the public.\"</p><p>The regulator has previously found Optus failed to provide access to emergency call services for 2,145 people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-67340901\">during an outage in 2023</a>, and then failed to check on 369 people affected afterwards. It was hit with more than A$12m ($8m; £6m) in penalties.</p><p>Communications Minister Anika Wells on Monday said telecommunications providers had \"no excuse\" for triple-0 call failures and that she had spoken to Mr Rue - who the prime minister says should considering resigning.</p><p>\"You would be unsurprised to hear that I expressed my unbelievable disappointment that we were here again so quickly. Or here again at all.\"</p><p>The company had \"perpetuated an enormous failure on the Australian people\" and would face \"significant consequences\", she said.</p><p>Investigations are still underway, but Mr Rue has said he intends to give public updates daily \"as more information becomes known\".</p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Tens of thousands of Brazilians joined protests in cities across the country on Sunday to protest against a bill which could result in ex-President Jair Bolsonaro being granted amnesty. </p><p>Bolsonaro was found guilty of plotting a coup earlier this month and has been sentenced to 27 years in prison. He will remain under house arrest until his lawyers have exhausted all appeals.</p><p>But the ex-leader's allies in the Chamber of Deputies have fast-tracked a bill which could see Bolsonaro and his co-defendants spared jail.</p><p>The demonstrators also expressed their anger at the lower house's passing of a constitutional amendment which would make it harder to launch criminal proceedings against lawmakers. </p></div><div><p>Under the proposal, members of Congress would have to give their approval - in a secret ballot - before a lawmaker could be charged or arrested.</p><p>Critics have dubbed it the \"Banditry Bill\" but members of Congress who supported it said it was necessary to shield them from what they said was \"judicial overreach\".</p><p>The proposed constitutional amendment will now go to the Senate. </p><p>Sunday's protests had the backing of trade unions, social groups and left-wing political parties and drew tens of thousands of attendees in several major cities.</p><p>Many chanted \"no amnesty\" and held up placards calling Congress \"shameless\".</p><p>At the event in Rio de Janeiro, veteran singers Chico Buarque, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso entertained the crowds.</p></div><div><p>The demonstrations also drew the support of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who wrote on X: \"I stand with the Brazilian people. Today's demonstrations show that the population does not want impunity or amnesty.\"</p><p>President Lula has also said that he would veto the amnesty bill were it to be passed by the Senate.</p><p>The anti-amnesty protests came two weeks after supporters of ex-President Bolsonaro took to the streets to denounce the legal proceedings against him.</p><p>The rival marches are a sign of how divided Brazilians remain over the Bolsonaro trial.  </p><p>A majority of Supreme Court justices found that Bolsonaro and his seven co-defendants had conspired to try to cling to power after he lost the election to Lula in 2022.</p><p>The court said that while their efforts to launch a coup had failed because of lack of support from top military leaders, it had culminated in the storming of Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace on 8 January 2023 by thousands of Bolsonaro supporters. </p><p>Order was quickly restored and more than 1,500 people were arrested, with some received lengthy sentences.</p><p>Bolsonaro's Liberal Party has been advocating for an amnesty for them and for the ex-president ever since. </p><p>But those who gathered on Sunday at the protests shouted \"prison for Bolsonaro\" and many told local reporters that they were \"fighting for Brazil's democracy\".</p><p>A survey published by pollster Datafolha on 16 September suggested that 50% of respondents thought Bolsonaro should go to prison, while 43% of the 2,005 people polled said he should not be jailed.  </p></div>"

We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\"</p><p>Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, it added, and without it, women face a dangerous choice between suffering through conditions like fever or use riskier alternatives.</p><p>The BBC has contacted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for comment. </p><p>In April, the leader of HHS, Robert F Kennedy Jr, pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months.</p><p>But experts have cautioned that finding the causes of autism - a complex syndrome that has been researched for decades - would not be simple. </p><p>The widely held view of researchers is that there is no single cause of autism, which is thought to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25l92q9xgo\">Tylenol-maker shares hit after report of autism link</a></li></ul><p>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology said doctors across the country have consistently identified Tylenol as one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women.</p><p>\"[S]tudies that have been conducted in the past, show no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during any trimester and fetal developmental issues,\" the group has said. </p><p>The drug is recommended by other major medical groups as well as other governments around the world. </p><p>In August, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/\">review of research</a> led by the dean of Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health found that children may be more likely to develop autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders when exposed to Tylenol during pregnancy. </p><p>The researchers argued some steps should be taken to limit use of the drug, but said the pain reliever was still important for treating maternal fever and pain, which can also have negative effects for children. </p><p>But another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38592388/\">study, published in 2024,</a> found no relationship between exposure to Tylenol and autism. </p><p>\"There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship,\" said Monique Botha, a professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University. </p><p>Dr Botha added that pain relief for pregnant women was \"woefully lacking\", with Tylenol being one of the only safe options for the population. </p><p>Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, and by 2020 the rate among 8-year-olds reached 2.77%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Scientists attribute at least part of the rise to increased awareness of autism and an expanding definition of the disorder.

    "body": "<div><div><p>2 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Paul Kirby</span><span>Europe digital editor</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>President Emmanuel Macron will formally recognise a Palestinian state in New York on Monday, backed by several other European countries, describing France's move as a \"necessity\".</p><p>Coming hard on the heels of a decision by the UK, Canada and Australia, Macron said his move would be the \"beginning of a political process and a peace and security plan for everybody\".</p><p>France, like the UK, carries considerable diplomatic weight as both a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the G7, and is co-ordinating the push with Saudi Arabia on the sidelines of this week's UN General Assembly.</p><p>Paris will not be joined by two of the other big European states in the G7, Germany and Italy, and not by the US either.</p></div><div><p>Israel has denounced the move as a reward for Hamas, and its UN ambassador has called Monday's event a circus.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the River Jordan, and President Isaac Herzog said recognising one would only \"embolden the forces of darkness\".</p><p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot was adamant that his country's move was a \"categorical rejection\" of Hamas but said it was \"symbolic, immediate, and political, demonstrating France's commitment to the two-state solution\". </p><p><b>Read more:</b> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1wggrdn9dno\">UK says Israel must not retaliate against statehood push</a></p></div><div><p>Barrot spoke of Macron's declaration as a \"great diplomatic victory for our country\". Paris has said Belgium, Luxembourg and Malta are also set to announce formal recognition, along with the tiny states of Andorra and San Marino. Portugal made its own declaration late on Sunday.</p><p>A number of other European countries have already recognised a Palestinian state, including Spain and Norway last year, but Macron's move is seen as a gamble by some domestic commentators which might make little difference on the ground.</p></div><div><p>Ahead of Macron's announcement, the Palestinian and Israeli flags were displayed on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday night. A number of town halls in France also flew Palestinian flags on Monday, despite a government order to local prefects to maintain neutrality.</p><p>Pro-Palestinian protests also took place in Italy, in some 80 towns and cities in Italy, where Giorgia Meloni's government said recently it could be \"counter-productive\" to recognise a state that did not exist.</p><p>Public transport and ports were disrupted in a day of action organised by some trade unions. A key metro line in Milan was shut down, while university students in Turin and Bologna blocked access top lecture halls.</p><p>In Germany, the government says Palestinian statehood is not currently up for debate, and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul explained as he left for New York on Monday that \"for Germany, recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of the process. But this process must begin now\".</p><p>Although Germany is one of Israel's closest allies in Europe, its chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has become increasingly critical of Israel's military response in Gaza.</p><p>European Union officials have also toughened their language against Israel in recent weeks. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for an end last week to \"the horrific events taking place in Gaza on a daily basis\".</p><p>In a CBS News interview late on Sunday, President Macron spoke of a phased plan that would be geared towards isolating Hamas.</p><p>The first stage would involve a ceasefire, a release of all hostages and then the stabilisation of Gaza, he explained. The second would involve governance and reconstruction of Gaza, and the \"third package, the perspective of two states\".</p><p>Opening a French embassy would be conditional on the release of hostages still held by Hamas, he stressed.</p><p>But Macron's high-profile move in United Nations has met with criticism from some of his political opponents.</p><p>Jordan Bardella, of the far-right National Rally, said it was a \"mistake, while Hamas still holds Israeli hostages\", and he pointed out that it amounted to \"rewarding the atrocities committed on 7 October [2023], during the deadliest attack ever known by the state of Israel\".</p></div>"

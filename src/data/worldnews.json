    "body": "Four people have been killed and 12 others injured, four critically, after a mass shooting in the US state of Mississippi.The shooting happened at around midnight on the main street in Leland, a small town 120 miles (190km) north-east of the state capital Jackson, the small city's Mayor John Lee told the BBC.Four of the injured were airlifted to hospital, Lee added. No suspects were in custody, but a police manhunt was under way.Leland was busier than usual on Friday with the local high school scheduled to play a football game to mark homecoming, an annual US tradition, usually in autumn, when former students are welcomed back to celebrate school spirit and community. The mayor said that the shooting did not take place on the Leland High School campus.\"This is an event where we have held yearly for years and hadn't had any incidents of this sort, ever,\" Lee told BBC. \"And we're a city that, not high crime and about 3,700 people. We all get along, and everybody knows everybody. So this is definitely a tragedy to us.\"The Leland Police Department is still investigating the incident and told the BBC it cannot share any further details at this time, including how many rounds were fired and what kind of gun was used. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is helping the inquiry.State Senator Derrick Simmons told the Associated Press that the scene was \"very chaotic\" after the gunfire erupted, as police and first responders rushed to the area \"from all over\". \"People were just congregating and having a good time in the downtown of Leland,\" Simmons told the AP. Officials are asking for anyone with information about the \"horrific\" shooting to come forward, Simmons added. A deadly shooting was also reported on Friday night in another small Mississippi town, Heidelberg, about 200 miles south-east of Leland.That attack also happened during the town's homecoming weekend, and claimed two lives, Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White told the AP. There is no indication the Leland and Heidelberg shootings were linked. ",

    "body": "11 hours agoDanai Nesta Kupemba andChris EwokorDozens of people have been killed in a drone strike at a displacement shelter in el-Fasher, a besieged Sudanese city on the brink of collapse, activists said.The resistance committee for el-Fasher, made up of local citizens and activists, said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) hit Dar al-Arqam camp, located within a university, with two drone strikes and eight artillery shells. The RSF has denied it carried out the strike.\"Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,\" a statement from the group said. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as rescuers pulled bodies from the rubble.Sudan Doctors Network said 57 people were killed in the drone attack, including 17 children, and 17 were injured. Activists said at least 60 people had been killed.Hospitals already struggling under months of siege have been overwhelmed, with doctors treating the wounded on floors and in corridors.The RSF has surrounded el-Fasher for the last 17 months, in an attempt to take control of the Sudanese army's last stronghold in the Darfur region. The situation in el-Fasher has \"gone beyond disaster and genocide\", the resistance group said.Sudan has been ravished by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued - creating one of the worst humanitarian crises.The army controls most of the north and the east. El-Fasher is the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by the army and its allies. The RSF also controls almost all of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan.If el-Fasher falls the RSF will control the entire Darfur region, where they hope to form an alternative government. In recent weeks, the RSF has intensified its assault on el-Fasher, leading experts to believe the city could soon fall unless the army receives immediate reinforcements. Research showed the RSF had finished building an earthen wall around el-Fasher, bolstering their siege and making it even harder for civilians to escape.The UN said there were 250,000 civilians trapped in el-Fasher, and warned that continued strikes on civilian areas may amount to war crimes.Hunger and disease has spread across the city as residents contend with constant bombardment and dwindling food and medical supplies. Two days ago, at least 13 people were killed after the RSF shelled one of the last remaining hospitals in el-Fasher.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk condemned the continued killing and injuring of civilians on Friday. \"I am appalled by the RSF's endless and wanton disregard for civilian life,\" he said.More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes.",

    "body": "Former US President Joe Biden is receiving radiation therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer, his spokesman has said.The spokesman also said that Biden, 82, was undergoing hormone treatment, without giving any further details.The radiation treatment was expected to span five weeks and marked a new point in his care, a source told NBC News.In May, Biden's office announced that he had been diagnosed with a more aggressive form of the disease, which had spread to his bones. The discovery came after the Democratic politician reported urinary symptoms that led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. The Biden office said at the time that \"he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone\".\"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management.\"A Gleason score of nine meant his illness was classified as \"high-grade\" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK.A person close to Biden has said the former president is doing well and responding to treatment, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported, with another source telling the outlet that the radiation started \"a few weeks ago\" in Philadelphia. Biden left office in January as the oldest serving US president in history and questions about his health dogged his first term, leading him to end his run for re-election late in his campaign.His former Vice-President, Kamala Harris, ran instead as the Democrats' presidential candidate, losing to current US President Donald Trump.For many years, Biden has advocated for cancer research.In 2022, he and his wife Jill Biden relaunched the \"cancer moonshot\" initiative with the goal of mobilising research efforts to prevent more than four million cancer deaths by the year 2047.Biden lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015.The former president and vice-president has also been treated twice for skin cancer, in 2023 and 2025.In recent months, Biden has largely retreated from the public eye. In May, he sat down for an interview with the BBC - his first since leaving the White House - where he admitted that the decision to step down from the 2024 race was \"difficult\".Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men, behind skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that 13 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives. It says age is the most common risk factor.",

The statement by the Danish defence ministry says the purpose of its military is security, and if necessary, defence in the Nato security alliance.\"The task of the Armed Forces is to ensure security throughout the Kingdom - and, if necessary, to defend Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark within the framework of Nato in all domains,\" the Chief of Defence, Michael Hyldgaard, told Danish public broadcaster DR, without saying who the potential adversaries were.Denmark worked on the new defence package with the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.It will buy two new Arctic ships, maritime patrol planes, drones and early warning radar.Crucially, a new Arctic command headquarters will be set up in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, alongside a new military unit under Joint Arctic Command in Greenland.In addition, an undersea cable connecting Greenland and Denmark will be funded. The struggle for control of the Arctic is accelerating - and riskier than everGreenland in particular is strategically located between North America and Russia. Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of Denmark.In recent years, there has been increased interest in the vast island's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron.Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. The island has been home to a US radar base since the Cold War and also hosts a large American space facility.US President Donald Trump has suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are \"all over the place\".Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to acquire Greenland, saying the island was \"critical\" for national and economic security.Greenland's prime minister has said the territory is not for sale, adding that \"Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland\".",

    "body": "23 hours agoBrandon DrenonWashington DC First Lady Melania Trump says Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to her letter of concern about the child victims of the Russia-Ukraine war.She made the announcement on Friday, saying that after an \"open channel of communication\" with Putin, Ukranian children displaced in the war had been reunited with families.The First Lady's \"peace letter\" was hand delivered to Putin during his Alaska visit in August.President Donald Trump shared parts of the letter on social media. In it, the first lady pleads with Putin to protect children, writing that doing so \"will do more than serve Russia alone\" and \"will serve humanity itself\".\"Eight children have been rejoined with their families during the past 24 hours,\" Mrs Trump said, flanked by American flags behind a podium in the White House.\"Each child has lived in turmoil because of the war in Ukraine.\"Of the eight children, the First Lady said three separated from their families were displaced to Russia because of front-line fighting.Another young girl displaced by the conflict has now been returned from Ukraine to Russia, Mrs Trump says.The children's reunification with their families was facilitated by both Ukraine and Russia, the First Lady said, adding that she was given a detailed report with photographs and the \"identities and circumstances\" of each child.The US government \"confirmed the facts\", she said.Mrs Trump said she has \"learned a lot about this matter\" since her letter was first handed to Putin. She said he responded in writing. In her letter, the First Lady wrote: \"Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart... They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.\" The announcement marks a positive development in her advocacy for children from the White House, which began during President Trump's first term. She launched the BE BEST initiative in January 2021, which the White House describes as an awareness campaign focused around the well-being of children globally.Earlier this year, the First Lady led an initiative for Congress to pass a bill banning revenge porn called the Take It Down Act. After the bill was signed, she said it was \"a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children\".According to the Ukrainian government, at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been deported and forcibly displaced from their homes to Russia and Russian-occupied territories since February 2022.Just 1,605 have come home so far, according to the government's Children of War database, external.The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Children's Rights Commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, in 2023 for the alleged unlawful deportation of children.Russia denies the accusation and says it has protected children by moving them from a war zone for their safety.",

    "body": "At least 27 people have died and others are missing, according to authorities, after floods in Mexico triggered landslides and swept away homes, vehicles and bridges.  Heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday caused rivers to burst their banks. Hidalgo in east Mexico was one of the worst affected areas, with 16 deaths reported.   Thousands of houses have been damaged or destroyed as fast-running water careered down streets, carrying cars, while highways were blocked with debris and electricity cut off.  Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said the government has deployed 5,400 personnel to help communities, clear roads and hand out aid.She wrote on social media: \"We are working to support the population, open roads and restore electrical service.\"In addition, 3,300 naval troops are helping with evacuations as well as clearing up the aftereffects of the floods.In Puebla, state governor Alejandro Armenta said at least nine people had died while five others had been reported missing. An estimated 80,000 people have been impacted by the weather in Puebla alone, the state's government said.An additional two people died in Veracruz.\"No one was prepared for this,\" Jose Cervantes, owner of a coffee shop in one of the affected areas, told Reuters news agency.\"The flood reached a height of one and a half meters. Everything was flooded, the dining room and the entire restaurant, the kitchen, the bathroom, the games room, the private area. Everything is in terrible condition.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoDearbail Jordan andHafizullah MaroofBBC AfghanIndian politicians and journalists have criticised the government for failing to speak out after female journalists were excluded from a press event with the Afghan Taliban foreign minister in Delhi.Around 16 male reporters were selected to attend a forum on Friday with Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy. Journalists observed women and foreign media being turned away.India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it \"had no involvement in the press interaction\" at the Afghan embassy.A source in the Taliban government admitted women had not been invited to attend.They told the BBC \"female journalists were excluded due to lack of proper coordination and will be invited to next conference if held in Delhi\". Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said by allowing the event to go ahead, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was \"telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them\".The Editors Guild of India strongly condemned the exclusion and said: \"Whether or not the MEA coordinated the event, it is deeply troubling that such a discriminatory exclusion was allowed to proceed without objection.\"It called for India's government to \"publicly reaffirm that press access at diplomatic events held in India must respect gender equity\".Muttaqi is in India for a week of high-level talks with the government. On Friday, he met with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would re-open its embassy in Kabul. It was shut after the Taliban returned to power.Since 2021, the Taliban government has imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law which have severely impacted the rights of Afghan women and girls.  Following the men-only press event, Rahul Gandhi said on social media: \"In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space.\"Indian politician Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked Modi to clarify his position on \"the removal of female journalists\" from the gathering.She asked how \"this insult to some of India's most competent women\" had been allowed in \"a country whose women are its backbone and its pride\".Others expressed shock and said the men who went to the event should have walked out in solidarity with their female colleagues.\"Why did our emasculated spineless male journos remain in room?\" wrote politician Mahua Moitra on social media. She added: \"Government has dishonoured every single Indian woman by allowing  Taliban minister to exclude women journalists from presser. Shameful bunch of spineless hypocrites.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoCarrie DaviesPakistan correspondent,Stuart Lau andEthirajan AnbarasanThe Taliban government has confirmed that it attacked Pakistani troops in multiple mountainous locations on the northern border.Casualties are not yet clear in what the Taliban government called \"retaliatory operations\", after it claimed Pakistan had violated Afghan airspace and bombed a market inside its border on Thursday.Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the Afghan attacks were \"unprovoked\" and civilians were fired at, warning that his country's forces would respond \"with a stone for every brick\".Islamabad has accused Kabul of harbouring terrorists who target Pakistan on its soil, a claim the Taliban government rejected.Both the Afghan and Pakistani sides are said to have used small arms and artillery in the Kunar-Kurram region, the BBC understands.Saying that he \"strongly condemns\" the Taliban's attacks, Naqvi stated: \"The firing by Afghan forces on civilian populations is a blatant violation of international laws.\"Afghanistan is playing a game of fire and blood,\" he said in a post on X.A Pakistani military spokesman said they would take necessary measures to safeguard Pakistani lives and properties.Pakistan's military has not officially commented, but a security source speaking to the BBC claimed that firing took place at several locations along the Pakistani-Afghan border, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral and Baramcha.A police official stationed near the Zero Point in Kurram district told the BBC that heavy weapons fire began from the Afghan side around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT).He said they had received reports of intense gunfire from multiple locations along the border.Last week, Afghanistan's Taliban government accused Pakistan of violating Kabul's \"sovereign territory\", as two loud blasts were heard in the city late on Thursday.Pakistan bombed a civilian market in the border province of Paktika, in Afghanistan's south-east, the Taliban Defence Ministry said on Friday. Locals there told the BBC's Afghan service that a number of shops had been destroyed.A top Pakistani general alleged Afghanistan was being used as a \"base of operation for terrorism against Pakistan\". Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of permitting the Pakistan Taliban,  known as the TTP, to operate from their land and fight against the Islamabad government in a bid to enforce a strict Islamic-led system of governance. The Afghan Taliban government has always denied this.The latest escalation coincided with an historic week-long trip to India made by Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, his first since the Taliban's return to power. In a diplomatic thaw, Delhi said that it would reopen the embassy in Kabul, which was shut four years ago when the Taliban returned to power.\"Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India, so that it will not dare to look at Pakistan with a malicious eye,\" Naqvi warned.In a statement, Saudi Arabia, which signed a mutual defence pact with Pakistan last month, called for self-restraint and avoidance of escalation between Islamabad and Kabul.Qatar also expressed concern over the Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions, calling on both sides to \"prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint\".",

    "body": "Rare wildflowers blanket Atacama desert1 day agoBBC WeatherAFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThe Atacama desert in Chile sits long and lean, sandwiched between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.The desert's extreme aridity makes it one of the clearest places on Earth to view the night sky and is famous for being home to the largest radio telescope in the world. But the usually barren landscape has been transformed by a carpet of colourful wildflowers, which have been brought to life by significant rainfall during the southern hemisphere's winter months.This is thought to be an event that only occurs every few years, when above average rainfall soaks the desert floor, causing dormant seeds to spring to life.Anadolu via Getty Images/Lucas Aguayo AraosAFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThe Atacama desert typically receives less than 15mm of rain every year.But the area had more than 12mm of rain during August alone - most of which fell on just one day.The desert even saw a rare blanket of snow back in June.AFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThis magnificent bloom is made up of more than 200 different species of wildflowers, some of which do not grow anywhere else in the world. It typically occurs between the end of August and November.Although thought of as rare, this phenomenon also occurred in 2024, following heavy rainfall in the area.This year's display will be at its peak for another few weeks, according to CONAF, Chile's National Forest Corporation.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "17 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent reporting from IstanbulHamas is pressing Israel to include prominent Palestinians in a prisoner-release list -  part of a ceasefire deal that will also see hostages returned from Gaza.Hamas's insistence comes after the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 prisoners to be freed, but excluded seven high-profile prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat.The men, who are serving sentences after being convicted of involvement in separate deadly attacks in Israel, have long been seen by Palestinians as symbols of resistance.Twenty Israeli hostages are expected to be released before 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday as part of the deal proposed by US President Donald Trump.A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that US envoy Steve Witkoff had promised to raise the exclusion of the Palestinian prisoners with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Israel has firmly refused to include them.It is not clear whether this could be a sticking point, or impact the timeline for the release of hostages from the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.Follow live updatesHamas mobilises thousands of fighters in GazaWhat we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementPalestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityThe releases are due to take place in the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal, approved this week to end the two-year war in Gaza.It is unclear how the hostages will be released this time - on previous occasions Hamas paraded them in public, infuriating Israel and many of its Western allies. The bodies of deceased hostages will also be returned. It is thought that at least 26 hostages are deceased, with the fate of two others unknown.Israel will also release about 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails, and another 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza who have been detained.Hamas had submitted a list of prisoners it wanted released that included Barghouti and Saadat.Barghouti is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted in 2004 of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed. Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders.Barghouti remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction that dominates the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.Saadat, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), was sentenced to 30 years after being convicted in 2008 of heading an \"illegal terrorist organisation\" and involvement in attacks, including the assassination of an Israeli minister in 2001.Among the 250 prisoners set to be released is Iyad Abu al-Rub, an Islamic Jihad commander convicted of orchestrating suicide bombings in Israel that killed 13 people in the early 2000s.According to the Israeli justice ministry, he will be released either to Gaza or deported abroad.The BBC understands that Hamas is also pushing for some possible additional prisoner releases. These relate to Palestinian prisoners who were released years ago as part of an exchange for the hostage Gilad Shalit - and then were rearrested after 7 October.Hamas argues that since they were part of a previous hostage exchange, they should not be included in the 250 figure.In Israel, hospitals are preparing for the release of hostages as families await their return.The first phase of the Israel-Hamas deal saw a ceasefire take effect on Friday and Israeli forces partially withdraw from parts of Gaza. Hundreds of aid trucks a day are now expected to enter. The next phases are still being negotiated.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned from southern Gaza to Gaza City, weeks after fleeing the Israeli offensive that destroyed much of the city.Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency has said it is conducting recovery operations and pulling bodies from the rubble, with Palestinians still missing across the territory.Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Since then, 67,682 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.Additional reporting by Mallory Moench",

    "body": "Indian student captured by Ukraine joined Russian army to avoid drug charges, says mother 9 hours agoGopal KateshiyaBBC Gujarati, MorbiHasina MajotiSahil Majothi had gone to Russia to study computer engineeringUkraine has captured an Indian national allegedly fighting for Russian forces, the first known Indian detained in the ongoing war.Sahil Majothi, 22, from the Indian state of Gujarat, went to Russia to study computer engineering two years ago. His mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case last April.Mr Majothi joined the Russian army to avoid imprisonment over drug charges,  according to a video released by Ukraine's army on Tuesday.The Indian foreign ministry says it is investigating the case and has not received formal communication from Ukraine. The BBC has asked the Russian government for a response. In an interview with BBC Gujarati, Mr Majothi's mother Hasina Majothi said her son went to Russia in January 2024. He completed a three-month language course in St Petersburg before moving to Moscow for college, supporting himself part-time as a kitchenware courier.She alleges that in April 2024, someone slipped drugs into a parcel handed to Mr Majothi during his deliveries.\"The police caught him with it and charged him,\" Ms Hasina said. According to Ms Hasina, her son was detained, held for six months and later sentenced to seven years in prison. The family hired a private lawyer in Russia to defend him, but they had no idea when or how he was drafted into the military.\"I don't know how he ended up in Ukraine. I only found out through the viral video,\" Ms Hasina said.In the video released by the 63rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army, Mr Majothi can be heard saying he was given a choice between joining the Russian army, with pay for his service, or serving jail time. He said he was told he would serve in the military for a year before being released. Mr Majothi claims that different people promised him varying amounts of money - from a hundred thousand to over a million roubles - but he never received any payment.He says he underwent 15 days of training in September 2024 and was sent to the battlefield a year later, on 30 September.The next day, on 1 October, Mr Majothi said he had an altercation with his commander, after which he separated from Russian soldiers. That was when he came across a Ukrainian dugout and asked them for help, he added.The BBC cannot independently verify the date or location of the video in which he makes these claims. Ukrainian army/FacebookMr Majothi says he underwent 15 days of training before being sent to the battlefield a year laterOn Wednesday, after the video went viral, Gujarat's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS)  questioned Ms Hasina and her brother in Ahmedabad. Her relatives said she separated from her husband around her son's birth and supports her family as a seamstress while living with her maternal relatives.ATS officials confirmed Mr Majothi's arrest and subsequent detention in Russia. They said the family claimed to have had no contact with him since his arrest. At his former school in Morbi, teachers called Mr Majothi an \"average student\" but deeply motivated to fulfil his mother's dreams through education. They spoke on condition of anonymity.Local community leaders have also appealed to the government to intervene and secure his return. \"Many young men like him have been trapped and dragged into the war,\" said  Kasam Sumra. \"We appeal to the government to bring back Sahil and other young Indians who went abroad seeking work.\" Mr Majothi's arrest comes amid rising concerns over Indians being recruited into the Russian military. Reports say over 150 Indians, some on student or visitor visas, have enlisted. At least 12 have died in the conflict and 16 remain missing.In September, Indian officials urged Moscow to release and repatriate 27 Indian nationals who had been recruited into the army.The Indian government has consistently advised its citizens against participating in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\"We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from offers to serve in the Russian army, as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,\" a spokesperson from India's foreign ministry said last month.Additional reporting by Roxy Gagdekar Chhara from Ahmedabad and Nikita Yadav from DelhiFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "13 hours agoTim FranksPetah TikvaBBCDr Steinman says working at the unit has taught her the \"strength of the human spirit\"When the first hostages are released by Hamas in Gaza, taken into Israel and transferred by helicopter to the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Dr Michal Steinman will take them up to the sixth floor, swipe open the glass door and see them reunite with their closest family after more than 700 days in captivity.\"It is a privilege,\" says the head of nursing. \"These are the moments, when I'm 70 or 80, these are the two or three moments I will remember. They symbolise so many values – as a nurse, as a mother, as a woman, as an Israeli.\"Twenty living hostages are due to be released under the terms of the agreement between Israel and Hamas. Several of them will be brought to this hospital.It will be the third time that the hostages' unit has gone operational. The BBC visited the unit on Saturday, when the medical team learned the identities of the hostages they would be treating.\"There is no such field as captivity medicine, and we are inventing it,\" said Dr Steinman told the BBC. The staff have learned two big lessons from the two previous hostage releases in November 2023 and January this year, she says.  The first is to be \"a medical detective\", to try to understand what happened in those long days and nights of captivity.  With earlier, often emaciated, shackled, beaten hostages, \"they had things in their blood exams, in their enzymes, that we couldn't understand\".  Follow live updatesWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?What we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementPalestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityThey also have learned that symptoms may not present for days or weeks.  \"Captivity does things to your body that your body remembers. You see all these layers. It takes time to see what happened to their bodies, to their souls,\" she said.  \"We're still taking care of the hostages who came back in January and February, and every week we discover new things.\"ReutersIt's the third time the hospital's unit has received freed hostages after previous release deals in late 2023 and January this year (file photo)The other lesson is to take time. There are a huge number of professionals from different disciplines: nutritionists, social workers, mental health specialists, along with the full panoply of medical staff.  But there is also a \"do not disturb\" card on the door of each released hostage's private room. The echoes of a hotel are deliberate, as are the care packages and soft furnishings and soft lighting to go with the hospital bed and monitors. There is an extra single bed made up for those hostages who don't want to be left alone overnight, so that a partner or relative can sleep alongside them. Their closest family will also have their own bedroom directly across the corridor from the hostage's.\"You know medical people are task-oriented. There's a schedule,\" says Dr Steinman. \"Here you have to give them much more space. You have to decide what's urgent, and what can wait another two days. You have to be humble and flexible, without letting go of your medical responsibility.\"Among those responsibilities is determining what the hostages, some of whom may have lost more than half their body weight in captivity, can eat, and how quickly.Their physical recuperation is only part of the story. Karina Shwartz is director of social work at the Rabin Medical Center.  She is another key member of the team, with a responsibility not just for the hostages but for their closest relatives. They need to learn their own delicate calibration of family dynamics – of when to speak and when not to, she says.\"The most important thing is what we're not saying,\" she says. \"Because if we're sitting in the room, and someone tells us something very difficult about how they almost died in captivity, and we stay silent: it's a very loud silence.\"But at the same time, there is a need to hold back. \"We can't speak about two years in a week. The hostages need space and time. They also need quiet. We have to listen. To listen to their story.\"Karina Shwartz and her team will prepare the hostages to leave the hospital and re-enter the outside worldThe staff in the hostage returns unit emphasise that their job does not end when the hostages return home. Medical and psychological rehabilitation will continue and the hostages must also be prepared, says Ms Shwartz, for the moment \"when the real world comes in\".  The message she and her team try to drill into the hostages and their families is that everyone will want to see them. For two years they have been public figures.\"Everyone will want to be friends.  We tell them: it's okay to say no. It's safe to say no.\"For now, the nervous anticipation among the staff is palpable.\"You should see my WhatsApp messages,\" says Dr Steinman, a very Israeli director of nursing with her nose piercing and multiple tattoos. Pretty much every single one of her 1,700 nurses across the medical complex has, she says, volunteered to pull extra shifts on the unit.  \"You gain hope again,\" she says. \"Working here you realise that life and human beings are good. You realise the strength of the human spirit.\"And yet, the greatest pleasure, she says, will be for that work to be over. \"This is the third time we're opening the unit.  To know that this is the last time: that when we close this place and say the mission is done.  Then we will know that the nightmare is over.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoNorberto ParedesBBC Mundo andAlex BoydWatch: 'A great honour for Venezuelan society' - Machado speaks to the BBCNobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado has told the BBC she is grateful for what US President Donald Trump is doing \"around the world for peace\".Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, was awarded the 2025 prize having long campaigned against the country's President Nicolás Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate.She told BBC Mundo that during a congratulatory phone call with Trump she told him \"how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy\".Trump has made no secret about wanting to win the award himself, regularly speaking about the seven wars he claims to have ended.Nominations for the award closed in January, just as Trump's second term as president began. A White House official said on Friday the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\".Machado said she was \"very glad\" to speak to the US president and was \"able to convey to him our appreciation\".The 58-year-old, forced to live in hiding for much of the past year, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said she was recognised for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".He added: \"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.\"Machado was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest.Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement.\"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she added. \"The democrats around the world share our struggle.\"She said she thought Trump and the international community were already helping with the political situation in Venezuela.\"The regime in Venezuela is a criminal structure,\" Machado told the BBC. \"And as such, it sustains themselves on the criminal flows from their illicit activities.\"We need the international community to cut those flows that are not only used for corruption, but also for repression, violence and terror.\"So when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls.\"And that's exactly what we're seeing, cracks that are getting deeper and deeper as we talk right now.\"Earlier this month, US forces killed four people in an attack on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly trafficking drugs.It was the latest in a number of recent strikes by the US on boats in international waters it said were involved in \"narco-trafficking\".They have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.On Thursday Colombian President Gustavo Petro said one of the boats was \"Colombian with Colombian citizens inside\", an allegation the White House called \"baseless\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi Asiedu & Blanca EstradaBucksnort, TennesseeSixteen people missing after a major explosion at a Tennessee munitions factory on Friday are presumed to be dead, according to the sheriff.Recovery teams had been clinging to hope of finding any of the missing alive, as of Saturday evening \"it's safe\" to assume they are deceased, said Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis.Authorities had originally feared that 18 people had died, but two people believed present during the blast were actually not at the site and have been located, according to Davis.It's still unclear what caused the explosion at the explosives plant in Bucksnort, Tennessee - roughly 56 miles (90km) south-west of Nashville.Video footage taken on Friday showed fires still burning, charred vehicles, and smoke rising from the razed building at the facility, which specialises in the development and manufacture of explosives. Officials said debris was scattered for half a mile around where the building once stood.Accurate Energetic Systems (AES), which runs the plant, has suspended its operations. Aerial footage shows devastation after blast at explosives manufacturer in TennesseeMore than 300 state and local first responders have been searching the site since Friday morning, Sheriff Davis said on Saturday.\"The expectation of anyone who's inside of that building… we can assume that they are deceased,\" he told media.\"As we get into this, we find it even more devastating than we thought initially,\" he told a news conference.By Saturday morning, the rescue mission had shifted to a recovery operation, said a visibly choked-up Davis. The FBI is also at the scene conducting rapid DNA tests to identify victims and notify families.\"We're trying to focus as much attention as we can, on taking care of their families,\" Sheriff Jason Craft, from neighbouring Hickman County, told the BBC.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is at the scene helping to investigate the incident. There was a previous fatal explosion at a unit in the same location in 2014.Ann Myers was woken from her sleep by the explosion on Friday morning and feared for the safety of her four children. She wondered if it was a tornado or a road accident.The camper home they live in shook and the electricity went out briefly.\"It was the weirdest thing ever,\" she said. \"So then I'm like, are we in a tornado? Is there, you know, a bomb somewhere? \"But then I thought maybe a tractor trailer, you know, hit somewhere off the interstate. So it's definitely very frightening.\"Justin Stover, whose property borders the sprawling AES plant, told the BBC his house shook violently following the explosion. At first, he thought it was a plane crash and he feared his house would collapse.\"Things fell off the wall, items fell off shelves,\" Mr Stover said. \"It was very intimidating, like the loudest thunder you've ever heard in your life and rumble.\"Then he saw \"a large cloud of smoke coming from the area of AES\", Stover added.He is still assessing damage to his house and said the explosion may have affected his water well.Stover, who has lived in Bucksnort for 20 years, said AES had about 80 workers.\"It's one of the only businesses in this area,\" he said. \"So it's one of the only places for employment, for locals. \"There's a lot of people that we know that work there and that possibly lost their lives yesterday morning.\"The tragedy will be devastating for the whole community, he said, as it has already been for families of the victims. Residents farther away from the site also heard the blast, including some in a town about 15 miles (25km) away, Sheriff Davis said on Friday.One local resident who lives about 20 minutes away from the facility told the BBC she was sitting at her daughter's dining table when she heard it. \"All of a sudden we just a heard a loud bang. We didn't know if it was a gun or what,\" she said.Another local resident, Lucy Garton said her husband knows people who worked in the facility.\"I think it will definitely impact the area,\" she said. \"It's a very close-knit community and everyone, they're just simple people, go to work every day, take care of their families and just real a family-oriented community.\"",

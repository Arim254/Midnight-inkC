    "body": "7 hours agoGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianandAlys DaviesTwo people are reported to have been killed during growing unrest in Iran on the fifth day of protests over the soaring cost of living.Both the semi-official Fars news agency and human rights group, Hengaw, said people had died during clashes between protesters and security forces in the city of Lordegan, in south-western Iran.On Thursday videos posted on social media showed cars set on fire during running battles between protesters and security forces. Many protesters have called for ending the rule of the country's supreme leader. Some have also called for a return to the monarchy.Thursday marks the fifth day of protests in cities across the country, sparked by a currency collapse.Videos verified by BBC Persian show protests in the central city of Lordegan, the capital Tehran and Marvdasht in the southern Fars province taking place on Thursday.Fars reported that in Lordegan two people were killed, citing an informed official. The report did not specify whether those killed were protesters or members of the security forces.Rights group Hengaw said the two killed were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.BBC Persian has not been able to independently verify the deaths.Separately state media said a member of the security forces linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) was killed in clashes with protesters on Wednesday night in the city of Kudasht, in the western Lorestan province. The BBC has not been able to verify this and protesters say the man was one of their number and was shot dead by the security forces. A further 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing in the area, the state media report said.Schools, universities and public institutions were closed across the country on Wednesday after a bank holiday was declared by authorities in an apparent effort to quell the unrest. It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "Three hikers, including a 19-year-old who fell approximately 500 feet (150m), have been found dead on Mt Baldy, a looming snow-capped mountain known to be one of the most dangerous to climb in Southern California.Rescue workers found Marcus Alexander Muench Casanova, 19, dead and discovered two other dead hikers during the search, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.The other two hikers were not hiking with the teenager, and it is not clear how long they had been deceased on the mountain.Casanova went hiking on 29 December with a friend who was able to call for help after the teen fell. The friend had to hike away from the fall site near the Devil's Backbone trail to an area with cell reception and provided their GPS location to rescue crews, authorities said. That companion was unharmed.Due to high winds, emergency crews were unable to complete a recovery operation by helicopter on Monday, but were able to recover the bodies on Tuesday.The sheriff's office said it had rescued five other hikers from the mountain in the previous five days.\"We are destroyed by the loss of our beloved Marcus,\" his family said in a statement on Wednesday. The statement described the California native as an \"avid sailor and outdoorsman\".Rising 10,064 feet (3068m) in the San Gabriel Mountains, Mt Baldy – officially known as Mt San Antonio – has become one of the deadliest peaks in the United States.More than 14 people have died on the mountain since 2020, including British actor Julian Sands in January 2023, although his remains were not found until five months later. More than 100 people have been rescued from the mountain since 2020.Proximity to Los Angeles means Mt Baldy attracts experienced and inexperienced climbers, and authorities urged people to stay off the mountain, especially during such unpredictable winter weather.\"It is one of the most dangerous trails we have here in our area,\" Jenny Smith, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, said of the Devil's Backbone trail during a news conference. \"We don't want novice hikers going up and hurting themselves.\"Southern California has been blanketed in rain and snow over the last week, but on 29 December, when the teen went hiking, the sun was shining, and the skies were blue with unusually clear visibility across the region.Mt Baldy was visible across Southern California, with breathtaking views from as far away as Catalina Island.The weather can change quickly on Mt Baldy, and conditions can be treacherous with snow and ice. Climbers venturing along the Devil's Backbone trail are advised to carry crampons and ice axes.Trails on the mountain have been temporarily closed until the new year following the deaths and the repeated rescue responses.",

    "body": "1 day agoRozina SiniandTom BennettReutersA train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash on TuesdayA passenger has described \"chaos\" after two trains collided head-on near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.Niels Honkoop, 33, told the BBC he had switched seats part-way through the journey from the middle of the train to the back, before it crashed, injuring many of those sitting near the front.\"I saw staff running around and people crying and people on the floor and chaos erupted,\" he said. \"We got off the train and I saw people bleeding with very severe injuries.\"A train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash, which took place at around 13:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Tuesday. Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Niels HonkoopNiels Honkoop (right) described the accident as \"chaos\"\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuMore on this story",

    "body": "Watch: Huge fire rips through historic Amsterdam church during New Year celebrationsPolice in the Netherlands were pelted with fireworks and faced an \"unprecedented amount of violence\" on New Year's Eve, officers have said.A 19th century church in Amsterdam was engulfed by fire in the early hours of New Year's Day, although the cause of the blaze is not yet known.The Vondelkerk, which overlooks the largest park in the city, the Vondelpark, has been a tourist attraction since it was built in 1872.Elsewhere in the Netherlands, a 17-year-old boy and 38-year-old man were killed in fireworks incidents. In Bielefeld, Germany, local police said two 18-year-olds died after setting off homemade fireworks.The head of the Dutch Police Union, Nine Kooiman, said she had been pelted by fireworks and other explosives on her shift in Amsterdam.The amount of violence was \"unprecedented\" she said.Reports of attacks against police and firefighters were widespread across the country. Petrol bombs were thrown at police in the southern city of Breda. In Rotterdam, the city's eye hospital said it had treated 14 patients, including 10 minors, for eye injuries. Two received surgery.A 17-year-old boy from Nijmegen and a 38-year-old man from Aalsmeer were killed in fireworks incidents, local media reported.In Amsterdam the 50-metre high tower of the historic Vondelkerk church collapsed. Authorities said the roof was badly damaged but the structure was expected to remain intact.The neo-Gothic basilica was designed by architect Pierre Cuypers whose works also include the Rijksmuseum. A ban on unofficial fireworks is due to come into force in 2026. According to the Dutch Pyrotechnics Association, a record €129m (£112m) had been spent on them this year.",

    "body": "A worker at Walt Disney World is \"recovering\" after being injured by a 400-lb (180kg) runaway fake boulder prop in an incident that was caught on video, the Florida theme park confirmed. The incident took place at the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! during a live recreation of a famous scene from the film.Video shows the boulder rolling towards the audience as a staff member jumps into its path, preventing it from reaching the crowd.\"We're focused on supporting our cast member, who is recovering,\" Disney said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Safety is at the heart of what we do, and that element of the show will be modified as our safety team completes a review of what happened.\"The scene from 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark shows Indiana Jones - played by Harrison Ford - outrunning a giant boulder triggered by a booby trap, before leaping to safety.Video of the incident on Tuesday shows the boulder bouncing off its tracks, and then bounding towards the audience as a staff member steps into its path and is knocked to the ground.The staff member did not appear to stand up immediately, and other workers are seen running to his side.According to a blog run by the park, the boulder prop is approximately 400-lbs and made of rubber. A spokesperson for Disney did not confirm that the boulder was the cause of the incident, but told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that \"a prop moved off its track\".One witness told People magazine that the worker had \"saved\" the audience from being injured. \"It was a crazy experience and definitely one that we will remember.\"In one video of the incident, a man behind the camera is heard saying: \"He literally saved our lives, that guy.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterUS Southern CommandA screengrab from a video posted by US Southern Command shows a small vessel in the sea with what appears to be debris floating nearby.The US military says it struck two boats it alleges were carrying drugs on Wednesday, killing five people on board.US Southern Command did not say where it had carried out the latest strikes but US forces have been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific for the past three months. Wednesday's strike came a day after the US targeted what it said were \"three narco-trafficking vessels travelling as a convoy\", killing at least three people.The Trump administration has cast its operations as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September. That first attack has come under particular scrutiny from lawmakers in Washington since it emerged that US forces struck the targeted boat twice.Two people who had survived the first strike and were clinging to the hull of their boat were killed in the second. Some lawmakers expressed concern that the \"double-tap\" strike breached the rules of engagement. In its post announcing the strike on a convoy of three boats carried out on 30 December, US Southern Command said that there had been a number of survivors, without specifying how many.It said that \"the remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels\". It added that the US Coast Guard had been \"immediately notified\" to search for the survivors.Reuters news agency reports that it was told by a US official who asked to remain anonymous that eight survivors were being searched for.It is not yet clear if any of them have been found. The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs but in its most recent post, Southern Command again insisted that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

    "body": "1 day agoNick ThorpeCentral Europe correspondentBulgaria - the poorest country in the European Union - has become the 21st member of the eurozone - leapfrogging more obvious and prosperous candidates like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.For mostly urban, young and entrepreneurial Bulgarians, it's an optimistic and  potentially lucrative leap - the final move in a game which has brought Bulgaria into the European mainstream - from Nato and EU membership, to joining the Schengen zone, and now the euro.For the older, rural, more conservative parts of the population, the replacement of the Bulgarian lev by the euro provokes fear and resentment.The lev - meaning lion - has been the Bulgarian currency since 1881, but it has been pegged to other European currencies since 1997 - first the Deutschmark, then the euro.Opinion polls put Bulgaria's 6.5 million population more or less equally divided on the new currency, and political turmoil is not making the transition easy. Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government lost a confidence vote on 11 December, after mass protests against the 2026 budget. Bulgaria has held seven elections in the past four years - an eighth looks likely early next year.\"I don't want the euro, and I don't like the way it has been imposed on us,\" Todor, 50, a small business owner in the central town of Gabrovo, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, told the BBC. \"If there were a referendum, I reckon 70% of the people would vote against it.\" A referendum on euro adoption was proposed by President Rumen Radev but rejected by the outgoing government. Todor's business, producing coloured plastics for the domestic market, had a bad  year because of high inflation, he said, and a fall in sales fuelled, he believed, by fear of the euro.Ognian Enev, 60, who owns a tea shop in central Sofia, was more enthusiastic. \"On the whole, it's a good thing. It's just a technical change. It doesn't bother me,\" he told the BBC. In any case, he pointed out, people who bought flats or cars until now have got used to prices marked in euros. The 1.2 million Bulgarians who live outside the country have also been sending money home for years in euros.Like many shopkeepers, Ognian has the new currency ready, in coins and small denomination notes, ready for the transition. Throughout January, you can pay in both lev and euros, but change is supposed to be in euros. From 1 February, it will no longer be permitted to pay in lev. He hopes joining the single currency will be good for trade - many of his flavoured and fruit teas come from sellers in the eurozone, while the more expensive, high-end teas are imported direct from China and Japan.Since August 2025, all shops in Bulgaria have been required by law to display prices in both currencies. Conveniently, €1 is worth about two lev (1.95583 to be exact). In response to public fears that prices will be rounded up, elaborate watchdogs have been created, to protect consumers. And some prices have been rounded down: the cost of public transport in the capital Sofia is due to fall slightly.The design on the reverse side of the new eurocoins was chosen to overcome worries that Bulgaria is losing its sovereignty. St Ivan of Rila is on the €1 coin, Paisius of Hilendar, an 18th Century monk and champion of the national revival, is on the €2 coin. The smaller denomination eurocents carry an image of the Madara rider, a symbol of early Bulgarian statehood, based on an 8th Century rock relief.Just how the new currency will impact Bulgaria as a whole, concerns everyone. The lessons from other countries offer two versions - the successful \"Baltic model\" followed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which combined the euro with reforms to streamline administration, encourage investment and combat corruption. And the \"Italian model\", where years of stagnation followed.\"I'm afraid we'll be more like Italy,\" Ognian Enev predicted.",

    "body": "2 days agoBen MilneandJames Percy,BBC NewsBBCThe first non-European Pope in more than 1,000 years, the Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and The Godfather, a soul legend and one of the world's most famous designers - here are some of the well-known faces no longer with us.Among those we remember are Hollywood stars Robert Redford, Diane Keaton and Gene Hackman, and theatrical dames Joan Plowright and Patricia Routledge.Robert RedfordGetty ImagesRobert Redford's acting career spanned more than 50 films and won him an Oscar as a director. For many filmgoers though, he was simply the best-looking cinema star in the world - once described as \"a chunk of Mount Rushmore levered into stonewashed denims\". As well as leading roles in hits such as All The President's Men, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Way We Were, Redford also launched the Sundance Film Festival to champion independent filmmakers.Read moreDiane KeatonGetty ImagesLos-Angeles-born Keaton shot to fame with her role in The Godfather, but enjoyed a long creative partnership with Woody Allen. Annie Hall, a comedy based on their off-screen relationship, earned her a Best Actress Oscar and they collaborated on several other films. She was nominated for three further Oscars - all in the best actress category - for her work in Something's Gotta Give, Marvin's Room and Reds.Read morePrunella ScalesGetty Images\"BASIL!\" - the unmistakable sound of Sybil Fawlty admonishing her pompous and incompetent husband, is probably how Prunella Scales will best be remembered.  Apart from starring in sitcom Fawlty Towers, she played many other roles on screen and stage, including Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett's play, A Question of Attribution. She also enjoyed an unlikely hit late in life with Channel 4's Great Canal Journeys, travelling waterways in the UK and elsewhere with her husband, the actor Timothy West.Read moreDavid LynchGetty ImagesPerhaps the most avant-garde filmmaker ever to make it big in Hollywood, David Lynch brought surrealism to the big screen in films including Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet. However, his groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks remained for many his greatest work - portraying an idyllic American small town encroached by a chaotic unconscious world.Read moreMalcolm-Jamal WarnerGetty ImagesBest known for his role as Theo Huxtable on The Cosby Show, Malcolm-Jamal Warner starred in the hugely popular US sitcom from 1984-1992. He had been handpicked for his breakout role on the final day of a nationwide audition - \"I was literally the last person they saw,\" he recalled in a 2023 interview. More recently, Warner appeared in several television programmes including Malcom & Eddie, and The Resident.Read moreGene HackmanGetty ImagesAs New York cop Popeye Doyle in the 1971 film The French Connection, Gene Hackman's cemented his reputation as one of Hollywood's great tough guys. That role won him his first acting Oscar (the second was for the 1992 Western, Unforgiven). Hackman also showed a gift for comedy in The Royal Tennenbaums and Young Frankenstein, among others.Read moreDharmendraGetty ImagesDubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\", Dharmendra was one of India's most famous film stars, with a career that spanned seven decades and more than 300 films. He could turn his hand to romance, action roles or comedy. One of his most popular films was the 1975 blockbuster, Sholay, where he played a petty criminal hired by the police to capture a villain. Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".Read moreDame Joan PlowrightGetty ImagesBorn in Lincolnshire, Joan Plowright became a leading lady in London's West End in the 1950s. She appeared opposite Sir Laurence Olivier - the man she later married - in John Osborne's The Entertainer at the Royal Court in 1957. Her career lasted more than 60 years, earning her awards for both stage and screen roles. In 2004, she was made a Dame of the British Empire.Read moreVal KilmerGetty Images\"The most unsung leading man of his generation,\" according to one movie critic, Val Kilmer starred as Tom Cruise's rival in Top Gun, Jim Morrison in The Doors and (less happily) Batman, taking over the role from Michael Keaton. In the early 2000s, the starring roles dried up, and in 2014, Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation left him with a tube in his trachea and difficulty breathing - something that was written into his final role, reprising his \"Iceman\" character in the 2022 Top Gun sequel.Read moreTerence StampGetty ImagesA stalwart of swinging London in the 1960s, Terence Stamp became famous for a string of films including Billy Budd, Modesty Blaise and Far From The Madding Crowd - as well as dating icons of that decade, Julie Christie and Jean Shrimpton. In the 1970s he took a break from acting, before returning as Superman villain General Zod, and later starring as a transgender woman Bernadette Bassenger in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Read moreBrigitte BardotGetty ImagesFrench actress who swept away cinema's staid 1950s' portrayal of women and personified a new age of sexual liberation. On screen, Brigitte Bardot was a cocktail of kittenish charm and continental sensuality, but it was an image she grew to loathe - eventually abandoning her career to campaign for animal welfare. Later, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.Read moreClaudia CardinaleGetty ImagesTunisian-born, Claudia Cardinale had a six-decade-long career, rising to fame during the golden age of Italian cinema. She shot to fame in 1963 when she appeared in Federico Fellini's Oscar-winning 8 1/2 and Luchino Visconti's epic period drama The Leopard. She also worked in Hollywood in the 1960s, starring in The Pink Panther, where co-star David Niven paid her the best compliment she said she ever received: \"Claudia, along with spaghetti, you're Italy's greatest invention.\"Read moreDame Patricia RoutledgeDame Patricia Routledge was best known as Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced \"Bouquet\") in the BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances. \"She's an absolute monster and I enjoyed playing her enormously,\" said the actress. Other comic roles included her monologues as Kitty in Victoria Wood: As Seen On TV (\"I could've married, I've given gallons of blood and I can't stomach whelks, so that's me for you\"). Success in TV followed a long career on stage, both in the West End and on Broadway.Read moreGraham GreeneGetty ImagesCanadian actor Graham Greene is best remembered for his role as Kicking Bird in the 1990 Western, Dances With Wolves. It was a part for which he received an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category. In real life, Greene was a member of the Oneida Nation, part of the Six Nations Reserve in southern Ontario. Greene had several jobs, including draftsman and steelworker, before becoming an actor in the 1970s. Other films he appeared in included The Green Mile, Die Hard With A Vengeance and Maverick.Read morePauline CollinsGetty ImagesAs Shirley Valentine, the frustrated Liverpool housewife who finds romance on a Greek island, Pauline Collins achieved international fame and an Oscar nomination.

The Glaswegian comic actor specialised in parodies of television and Hollywood films, where he played most of the parts. He also appeared in the ITV children's show Mr Majeika before retiring from television in 1990, but he continued to appear as a panto dame in Scotland for several more years.Read moreRob ReinerGetty ImagesOne of Hollywood's best known filmmakers, responsible for a string of much-loved films across a range of genres. Reiner's work encompassed the classic comedies This Is Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally, the courtroom drama A Few Good Men, and the tense thriller Misery. His directing career followed a successful spell as a TV star in the 1970s US sitcom, All In The Family.Read moreActors and performers who also died in 2025 include:Jean Marsh - Upstairs Downstairs actress and co-creatorRichard Chamberlain - star of Dr Kildare, Shogun and The Thorn BirdsThe Vivienne - drag queen and winner of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2019Michelle Trachtenberg - Gossip Girl and Buffy The Vampire Slayer actressTony Slattery - British actor and comedianJohn Stapleton - British journalist and TV presenterThis year saw the deaths of former US Vice-President Dick Cheney, the Conservative politician Norman Tebbit, and the influential political activist Charlie Kirk.Dick CheneyGetty ImagesOne of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history, Dick Cheney served two terms under George W Bush, from 2001 to 2009. After the 9/11 attacks, Dick Cheney was one of the main driving forces behind the \"war on terror\" that followed, and central to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Although known as a drier-than-dry conservative, he was a bitter critic of President Donald Trump, arguing in 2024 that there had \"never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic\".Read moreLord Norman TebbitGetty ImagesAs one of Margaret Thatcher's closest political allies, Norman Tebbit revelled in his combative reputation (he was once described as \"a semi-house-trained polecat\" by a Labour opponent). He also gave the 1980s one of its most memorable political soundbites when he described how his father \"got on his bike to look for work\".He left the Conservative Cabinet in 1987 to care for his wife, who had been left disabled by the Brighton bomb attack three years earlier.Read moreBaroness Jenny RandersonPA MediaLiberal Democrat politician Jenny Randerson became the first female Liberal Democrat minister anywhere, when she was appointed Wales's Minister for Culture, Sport and the Welsh Language in 2000.

In 1972 he founded the Front National, a party committed to stopping immigration. Le Pen's attempts to win the presidency foundered, although he finished runner-up in 2002. In 2015 he was expelled from his party by its new leader - his daughter, Marine Le Pen - after repeating a claim that the Holocaust was merely \"a point of detail\" in World War Two.Read morePolitical figures who died in 2025 also included: Dame Annette Brooke - The longest-serving female Liberal Democrat MPRaila Odinga - Former prime minister of KenyaMia Love - First US black Republican congresswomanIon Iliescu - Romania's first post-Communist presidentOur look back includes Beach Boy Brian Wilson, singer Marianne Faithfull, and reggae pioneer Jimmy Cliff.Marianne FaithfullGetty ImagesMarianne Faithfull rose to fame in 1964 at the age of 17, scoring a top-10 UK hit with As Tears Go By, co-written by her then-boyfriend, Mick Jagger.

Later in life, Faithfull enjoyed a second act (and a new, gravelly, vocal range) with LPs such as Broken English, and collaborations with artists including Nick Cave and Tom Waits.Read moreOzzy OsbourneGetty ImagesAs frontman for Black Sabbath - the Birmingham band many consider to have invented heavy metal - John \"Ozzy\" Osbourne gained a reputation as the \"wild man of rock\" (he once bit a bat's head off) both on stage and off. In the 2000s, he became one of the first stars of reality TV in The Osbournes, charting the everyday life of a rock superstar and his family.Read moreJimmy CliffGetty ImagesOne of the first stars of reggae music, Jimmy Cliff brought the sound of Jamaica to a global audience with hits such as Many Rivers To Cross, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.

The group's early songs, such as California Girls and I Get Around painted a picture of US west-coast surfers living the good life, while the 1966 LP, Pet Sounds, showcased Wilson's genius for complex melodies and intricate harmonies. Fragile mental health led to his withdrawal from the Beach Boys in the 1970s, but he overcame his demons to perform again late in life.Read moreD'AngeloGetty ImagesSinger who pioneered neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz, D'Angelo rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar.

He took Francis as his papal name in honour of St Francis of Assisi, a saint who renounced his wealth and lived among the poor. From his election onwards, he turned down many privileges traditionally accorded to the Pope. His early actions in the office included washing the feet of the elderly and prisoners and advocating for the rights of refugees and migrants.Francis's papacy heralded several reforms to the Catholic Church, but on many of its teachings, he was a traditionalist. He was at times supportive of some kind of same-sex unions for gay couples, but did not favour calling it marriage. He also took part in an anti-abortion march in Rome - calling for rights of the unborn \"from the moment of conception\".He died on Easter Monday, less than 24 hours after his last public appearance, in front of a crowd of worshippers at St Peter's Square in the Vatican.Read moreGiorgio ArmaniGetty ImagesItalian fashion designer who revolutionised the look of men's and women's suits in the 1960s, introducing softer styles for menswear and power suits for women - \"I realised that they needed a way to dress that was equivalent to that of men,\" he said.

He signed for Liverpool in a £45m deal, and his composure in front of goal made him a match-winner on many occasions under Jurgen Klopp and then Arne Slot. He was in the team that won a domestic cup double of the FA and League Cups in 2022, and despite latterly being hampered by injuries, he still made vital contributions in the 2024-25 season.Read moreBilly BondsGetty ImagesBilly Bonds captained West Ham to two FA Cup wins, in 1975 and 1980.

    "body": "3 hours agoBen TobiasWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireAround 40 people have died and 115 people are injured following a fire in a ski resort in south-west Switzerland, police say.Authorities said several nationalities were likely involved in the New Year's Day fire, which happened at 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) in a bar called Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana. It is being treated as a fire and there is \"no question\" of an attack, the region's chief prosecutor said.Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin has called it \"one of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced\". LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fireA helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117Here's what we know so far. What do we know about the victims? At a news conference on Thursday afternoon police said around 40 people were killed in the fire and 115 people were injured, many severely. The injured have been transported to hospitals across Switzerland. A burns unit in Milan in neighbouring Italy has also been made available. The director of Lausanne University Hospital told a Swiss newspaper that 22 patients had been transferred to her centre's care so far, mostly aged 16-26. Work is ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, the region's chief-prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said.But the Italian ambassador to Switzerland warned it could take weeks to identify the dead. Earlier, Italy's foreign minister said identification would be difficult due to the severe burns. People from several countries are believed to be involved. The Italian Foreign Ministry has told the BBC that 16 Italian nationals are currently missing, and between 12 and 15 others are receiving treatment in hospital.  Three Italian nationals - a woman in her twenties and two boys under 16 - were being taken to Milan to be treated at Niguarda hospital's major burns unit, local councillor Guido Bertolaso said.The French foreign ministry said eight of its citizens were missing and that it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.French media earlier reported that at least two of the injured are French nationals.French football club FC Metz said one of its youth players was \"severely burned\" in the fire. Tahirys Dos Santos, 19, has been airlifted to a hospital in Germany for treatment, the club said in a statement.President Emmanuel Macron said France was \"ready to provide any assistance\" and that people injured in the fire were welcome to be treated in French hospitals. The EU is also providing medical assistance to the victims, the bloc's President Ursula von der Leyen said.The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.What caused the fire? The cause is currently unknown but authorities say initial evidence does not suggest an attack.Asked about earlier reports of an explosion, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer said it \"is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises\".Two French nationals who said they were in the bar at the time described seeing a waitress put a birthday candle on top of a champagne bottle. \"One of the candles was held too close to the ceiling, which caught fire. In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood.\" Emma and Albane told French media outlet BFMTV.They described the evacuation as \"very difficult\" because the escape route was \"narrow\" and the stairs to get outside \"even narrower\". 'I hid from a wall of heat': Eyewitnesses describe escapeDisbelief as tragedy hits ski resort on New Year's DayIn a news conference on Thursday, Ms Pilloud also said the staircases appeared to be narrow, but investigations will assess whether they were in line with requirements.The regional police commander Frédéric Gisler said smoke was first seen emanating from a bar at around 01:30 local time, at which point emergency services were called. The first police officers were quickly on the scene followed by a major deployment of rescue teams, Mr Gisler said. Video shows moment Swiss bar fire appears to startWhat do we know about Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana? Le Constellation is a large bar in the the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana which has been around for many years. Although the resort itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reported from the resort.Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were likely drinking and dancing. It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts, and it is likely the bar was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating the start of 2026. A promotional video posted on YouTube for Le Constellation bar,  published in May 2024, showed women in motorcycle helmets walking through the bar while carrying sparklers in alcohol bottles above their heads.The caption, written in French, read: \"The Constellation Crans-Montana welcomes you every day from 9am to 2am, 365 days a year without interruption.\"Police Cantonale ValaisannePolice have released images from inside the bar after the fire showing chairs and benches strewn across the room",

    "body": "1 hour agoJemma CrewandGabriela PomeroyAround 40 people have died after a fire ripped through a bar in a ski resort in southern Switzerland, police have said. A further 115 people are injured, many of them \"severely\".The fire broke out at around 01:30 (00:30 GMT) during new year celebrations in a bar called Le Constellation in Crans-Montana.Officials investigating the incident have not confirmed any cause, but categorically ruled out an attack.People from multiple countries have been affected. Regional police commander Frédéric Gisler said the priority in the coming days was to identify those who had died \"so that their bodies can be returned rapidly\" to their families.Thirteen helicopters, 42 ambulances and 150 emergency responders were sent overnight to the scene of the fire in the Valais region, which is popular with tourists.Most of the injured experienced severe burns and 60 people were sent to Sion hospital in Valais, with a \"significant number\" in a critical condition, Regional governor Mathias Reynard said.What we know about the fireIts intensive care unit was at full capacity and Reynard said the local community must take extra care to avoid needing hospital treatment unnecessarily.\"We are painfully aware that identifying the bodies, as well as the injured, may still take a terribly long time for the families involved,\" Reynard added.Some people have been taken to hospitals in other Swiss cities including Lausanne and Zurich which have specialist burns units.A spokesperson for Lausanne University Hospital said they were treating 22 patients with burn injuries, while Zurich University Hospital said it was treating 12 patients for burns.Some patients were transferred to Geneva University Hospitals where they were being treated for severe, \"third degree\" burns, and were \"very young... between 15 and 25 years old\", Dr Robert Larribau  told the BBC's World Tonight programme.\"The fire broke out so intensely that burns can be internal. People breathed toxic smoke into the lungs,\" Dr Larribau said.The president of the UK Association of Fire Investigators, Richard Hagger, described the \"flashover\" effect believed to have made the blaze so deadly.\"You'll start with a fire, the flames and the thermal radiation will go to the ceiling level and mushroom out across,\" he told The World Tonight.\"That thermal radiation then travels downwards on to other fuel packages, such as furniture, tables, raises the temperature to the point when they thermally decompose and produce flammable gas. \"And then that gas ignites, but it ignites at a fairly rapid rate. So the room, in effect, becomes a full room on fire within a matter of seconds.\"The Italian Foreign Ministry told the BBC that 16 Italian nationals were currently missing, and between 12 and 15 others were receiving treatment in hospital.The French foreign ministry said eight of its citizens were missing and that it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.French media reported that at least two of the injured were French nationals.Three Italian nationals were being evacuated to Milan's Niguarda hospital where there was a major burns unit, Italian councillor Guido Bertolaso said.They have burns across \"30-40% of their bodies\", he told reporters, and they remained intubated, but \"the fact they could be moved is a good sign\".The precise number of dead and injured is not yet known, nor their nationalities but officials have confirmed that several nationalities were involved.Speaking at a press conference on Thursday evening, officials said they did not know how many people were in the bar when the fire broke out.State councillor Stéphane Ganzer described the bar as having a \"young festive population\" during the New Year's Eve party.Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud has said an investigation was under way \"to identify the circumstances which caused this dramatic situation to occur\".She was asked by journalists at the press conference about rumours that bottles of champagne carrying flares might have been the cause of the blaze, and whether the staircases were \"very narrow\".She replied that she could not confirm anything while the investigation is ongoing.Ms Pilloud said the staircases did appear to be narrow, but investigations would assess whether they were in line with requirements. She said \"several hypotheses\" for the cause of the blaze have been put forward, and the favoured theory was a \"general fire which caused conflagration\" - a large fire that causes a lot of damage, rather than an explosion.Several witnesses have been interviewed, she said, and phones have also been recovered for analysis.\"At no time is there question of any attack\", she said.Work was ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, Ms Pilloud said, adding: \"To do that there is significant work which needs to be carried out. And this significant work will require the closure of the district.\"The Italian ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, said it would take weeks to identify the dead.A helpline has been set up for families: +41 848 112 117The fire was \"one of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced,\" Swiss President Guy Parmelin told reporters. Local people gathered to pay tribute to the dead and injured at a vigil at Montana Station Church on Thursday evening, and floral tributes were laid near the scene of the fire.Crans-Montana is a luxury ski resort, famous in the 1980s for hosting the World Cup skiing.Le Constellation, which has been around for decades, has an upstairs with TV screens where people go and watch football matches, and a large bar downstairs for drinking and dancing.The UK Foreign Office said its \"thoughts are with all those injured and killed in the terrible tragedy\" and consular staff were on standby to provide support to any British nationals affected.King Charles said he and his wife Queen Camilla were \"greatly saddened\" to learn of the fire, and that it was \"utterly heartbreaking that a night of celebration for young people and families instead turned to such nightmarish tragedy\".French President Emmanuel Macron said France was receiving the injured from Crans-Montana to its hospitals.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was working with Swiss authorities to get medical help to victims through the EU's civil protection mechanism.",

    "body": "1 day agoHafsa KhalilandHarry Sekulich,SydneyGetty ImagesThousands turned out to see the New Year's Eve fireworks in Sydney Sydney has welcomed the New Year with a message of peace following the Bondi Beach mass shooting, as huge crowds gathered to watch the city's annual fireworks display.The words peace and unity were projected onto the Sydney Harbour Bridge, as thousands of heavily armed police officers patrolled the streets - a rare and stark sight in Australia - as part of heightened security measures.New South Wales (NSW) Police said more than 2,500 officers were on duty across the city, and some officers were authorised to carry high-grade weapons.The attack on 14 December targeted Australia's Jewish community and killed 15 people at a Hanukkah festival.Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesAn image of a menorah was projected onto the Sydney Harbour BridgeCrowds turned on their mobile phone flashlights as they observed the minute's silenceFollow live coverage from New Year's celebrations around the worldThe Sydney Harbour Bridge was lit up by a white light to symbolise peace, and a Jewish menorah was projected on to the pylons of the bridge to show solidarity with the Jewish community.Official New Year's Eve parties were paused at 23:00 local time (12:00 GMT) for a minute's silence to commemorate the victims of the attack.Pictures from Sydney Harbour - where thousands gather every year to watch the famous fireworks display - showed officers patrolling the crowds with longarm weapons.In the lead up to the event, Premier Chris Minns had warned that some people may find the sight \"confronting\", with police \"carrying firearms and weapons that you haven't seen before\".\"But I don't make any apology for that. We want people to be safe in our community,\" he added.British tourists Joe and Lucy said the increased police presence reassured them. The pair - who timed their Australia trip to coincide with the fireworks - were in Melbourne when the shooting occurred.\"We had our worries about coming for New Year's Eve,\" Joe told the BBC, adding, \"but we were reading more recently in the news... how more police were going to be here, it would be a bit safer\".Separately, Minns had urged Sydneysiders to not let the \"horrible criminal terrorist event\" at Bondi change the way they live, as he called on people to \"show defiance\" and celebrate the new year.This sentiment was shared by some of the spectators.Out among the crowds at Barangaroo's Observatory Hill, a close spot to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, was Hélène from Belgium.She told the BBC people \"cannot live in fear\" following the attack.Hours ahead of the countdown, hundreds of thousands of people flocked towards the harbour, with many official viewing areas filling to capacity by early evening.On the harbour, sailboats dotted the water - one of the best spots to watch the midnight fireworks display.Sydney's celebration - with its iconic fireworks display - kicked off a chain of events, from Dubai, to London and New York.Getty ImagesArmed police carrying assault rifles patrol outside the Sydney Opera House",

    "body": "20 hours agoLaura Gozzi,KyivandJames ChaterUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a peace agreement to end the war with Russia is \"90% ready\", in a New Year address that largely focused on resistance to Moscow's full-scale invasion.Zelensky said the remaining 10% of the agreement to end nearly four years of conflict would \"determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe\".In his own New Year speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his troops that \"we believe in you and our victory\".Earlier on Wednesday, Moscow also released what it said was evidence of Ukraine using drones to target Putin's private home on Lake Valdai in north-west Russia, allegations Kyiv has strenuously denied. It included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot.Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.In his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow secure full control of the industrial area in any peace agreement. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said. At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates. Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".On Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming - and which the alleged drone incident over Putin's residence may have pushed further into the distance.

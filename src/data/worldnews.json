    "body": "7 hours agoTabby WilsonLuca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoAn Italian mayor has apologised to the family of opera star Luciano Pavarotti after the town of Pesaro encased a statue honouring the late singer within a Christmas ice rink. The singer's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, told local media that she was \"angry and upset\" at what she called the decision to \"ridicule\" her late husband. The temporary ice rink was constructed in the centre of the town's piazza, leaving Pavrotti's statue knee-deep in ice and surrounded by perspex walls. In response, Mayor Andrea Biancani said that he didn't mean to offend anyone, and admitted that his council had \"made a mistake\".Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoBefore it was opened on 29 November, Biancani posted a doctored image of Pavarotti's statue playing ice hockey with the hashtag #DaiUnCinqueAPavarotti, which translates to \"Give a high-five to Pavarotti\".\"I didn't expect a town would allow this treatment of the memory and the image of a person who made Italy great around the world,\" Ms Mantovani told local outlet Il Resto del Carlino. She accused the council of making a \"poorly executed, absurd decision\". The life-size bronze statue was officially unveiled in Pesaro in April 2024, with Ms Mantovani and the couple's daughter, Alice, in attendance. The couple often holidayed in Pesaro, where Pavarotti had a villa and was an honorary citizen.Alamy/Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoOpera star Luciano Pavarotti's statue seen earlier in the year in the town of Pesaro (left), and in November, surrounded by an ice rink (right).Biancini told Il Resto del Carlino, which nicknamed the incident \"Pavarotti on Ice\", that when plans for the ice rink were initially presented to him, he was assured that the Pavarotti statue would not be touched and that it was only later that he found out designers had been forced to alter their construction. He said it would not be possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this late stage, but insisted that it would \"not happen again\".Pavarotti was an Italian tenor, and is widely known as one of the most successful opera stars of all time.His performances in the Three Tenors concerts were seen around the world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.His final performance was at the opening of the Winter Olympics in Turin in February 2006.He died the following year at the age of 71, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Pavarotti left behind four daughters from his two marriages. Ms Mantovani was his second wife. She remarried, to financial advisor Alberto Tinarelli, in 2020. ",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was just days into a seven-year prison sentence for fraud.  Bureau of Prisons records show that Gentile was released on Wednesday, less than two weeks after he reported to prison. Gentile, the former chief executive and founder of GPB Capital, was convicted last year in what federal prosecutors described as a multi-year scheme to defraud more than 10,000 investors by misrepresenting the performance of private equity funds.He's the latest in a string of white-collar criminals whose sentences Trump has commuted.Gentile was convicted in August last year of securities and wire fraud charges, and sentenced in May. His co-defendant, Jeffry Schneider, was sentenced to six years on the same charges and is due to report to prison in January.US attorney Joseph Nocella said at the time of Gentile's sentencing that GPB Capital was built on a \"foundation of lies\" and that the company made $1.6bn (£1.2bn) while using investor capital to pay distributions to other investors. \"The sentences imposed today are well deserved and should serve as a warning to would-be fraudsters that seeking to get rich by taking advantage of investors gets you only a one-way ticket to jail,\" he said. But the White House says the Department of Justice under former President Joe Biden made multiple missteps - and that investors were aware that their money could be going towards other people's dividends.\"Even though this was disclosed to investors the Biden Department of Justice claimed this was a Ponzi scheme,\" the White House official said.\"This claim was profoundly undercut by the fact that GPB had explicitly told investors what would happen.\"The official also cited concerns from Gentile that prosecutors had elicited false testimony.Trump's commutation of Gentile's sentence does not clear him of his crimes like a full presidential pardon would, and it does not get rid of other potential penalties imposed. So far in his second term, the president has pardoned or commuted the sentences of multiple people convicted of different types of fraud, including wire, securities, tax and healthcare fraud. Last month, he pardoned Tennessee state House Speaker Glen Casada who was convicted of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges.Correction 1 December 2025: This article incorrectly stated that Jeffry Schneider \"remains behind bars\". It has been amended to make clear that he is yet to begin serving his prison sentence.",

    "body": "24 minutes agoIan AikmanAFP via Getty ImagesProtests took place in cities across Bulgaria - the biggest for decadesBulgaria's government has said it will withdraw its controversial 2026 budget plan after massive rallies were held against it on Monday night in the capital, Sofia, and in cities across the country.Tens of thousands of people joined protests to oppose the draft budget, which they said attempted to hide widespread government corruption. Clashes with the police broke out when some masked protesters attacked the offices of the ruling conservative Gerb party and also of the DPS party in Sofia.The government said on Tuesday it would abandon the plan, which also would have raised taxes. It comes after similar protests broke out last week, when the initial plan was submitted to parliament.Next year's budget will be Bulgaria's first delivered in euros, as it joins the eurozone on 1 January.Public opinion over adopting the euro is divided, with some fearing it could lead to sharp inflation in what is one of the EU's poorest countries.Protests against government corruption have been frequent in Bulgaria, which has been run by short-lived governments since 2020, after protests sparked the end of another Gerb-led coalition.ReutersA drone view shows protesters gathered outside the parliament in SofiaMonday's rally is thought to have been the largest in the capital for years, with protesters filling a huge square in front of parliament carrying signs urging a change in leadership.Significant protests also took place in Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas, Blagoevgrad and other cities.Critics of the abandoned budget plan said they were protesting against increases to social security contributions and taxes on dividends to finance higher spending, as well as state corruption.\"We are here to protest for our future. We want to be a European country, not one ruled by corruption and the mafia,\" Ventsislava Vasileva, a 21-year-old student, told the AFP news agency.More than 70 people were arrested after masked protesters attacked the offices of political parties, according to Sofia's interior affairs chief Lyubomir Nikolov.ReutersProtesters in Sofia were seen setting bins on fire, breaking windows, and clashing with police in riot gearBulgarian President Rumen Radev called for an end to the violence, which he dismissed as a \"provocation by the mafia\", and urged everyone to obey the law. \"Provocations do not change the fact: Bulgarians said NO to this government,\" he said in a post on Facebook before the budget was abandoned. \"There is only one way out: resignation and early elections.\"As head of state, Radev holds a largely ceremonial role.The government is currently led by Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov, who formed a minority coalition in January 2025 after the centre-right Gerb party won October 2024's elections without a clear majority.A parliamentary committee had adopted the budget plan on 18 November, but Zhelyazkov later said he would delay it to allow for more time to consult opposition parties, trade unions and employers.After Monday's protests, Zhelyazkov's government issued a short statement saying it would withdraw its draft proposals and start a new budget procedure. Bulgaria's opposition party has called for the government to resign, saying abandoning the draft budget is not enough, according to local media.",

    "body": "1 day agoChris EwokorBBC Africa, AbujaGunmen have abducted at least 20 people, including a pastor and a new bride, in two separate attacks in the latest Nigerian kidnappings.Attackers stormed the newly established Cherubim and Seraphim Church on Sunday in the central Kogi state, firing shots and forcing congregants to flee in panic. They seized the pastor, his wife and several worshippers.In another raid the night before in the northern Sokoto state, a bride and her bridesmaids were among those kidnapped. A baby, the baby's mother and another woman were also taken, the AFP news agency reports.Schools and places of worship have increasingly been targeted in the latest wave of attacks in north and central Nigeria.It is not clear who is behind the kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments, however a presidential spokesman has told the BBC they believe they are the work of jihadist groups. Kogi state government spokesman Kingsley Fanwo confirmed the attack in Ejiba to the BBC but was unable to confirm the numbers.He said authorities were working to track down the attackers.\"The security network, comprising the conventional security agencies and the local security architecture are currently doing what they should do,\" he told the BBC.In the attack in the mostly Muslim Sokoto state, local media reported that the bride had been preparing for a wedding ceremony the following morning and she was seized alongside her friends and other guests who had gone to support her.Some 250 schoolchildren and 12 teachers are still believed to be missing following the biggest such attack in recent weeks, while those seized in other raids have reportedly been released.The spate of abductions has renewed concerns about the vulnerability of rural communities. It adds to pressure on the authorities to bolster protection for those at risk -  schools, churches and isolated communities.Paying ransoms has been outlawed in a bid to stop the lucrative kidnapping industry, however it is widely believed that such payments are still being made.Nigeria's security crisis attracted the international spotlight last month after US President Donald Trump threatened to send over troops if the government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".Nigerian officials and analysts say that members of all faiths are victims of the violence and kidnappings and say it is not true that Christians are being targeted.Additional reporting by Basillioh Rukanga",

    "body": "5 hours agoJames ChaterandLaura GozziRussian Presidential Press ServiceVladimir Putin was filmed visiting a command post at the weekend, in video released on the eve of Steve Witkoff's visit to MoscowRussian President Vladimir Putin will meet US special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on Tuesday, after the White House said it was \"very optimistic\" about reaching a deal to end the Ukraine war.US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has acted as an outside adviser in diplomatic talks, is also expected to attend.The summit comes after two days of negotiations in Florida between Ukrainian and US officials, including Witkoff and Kushner, aimed at refining a US-backed peace plan which had been viewed as favourable to Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the talks as \"constructive\", but said there were \"some tough issues that still have to be worked through\".Witkoff's meeting with Putin will be during the second half of Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Speaking after a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday, Zelensky said Kyiv's priorities in peace talks were maintaining Ukraine's sovereignty and securing strong security guarantees.Zelensky said the \"territorial issue is the most difficult\" element of the peace deal, with the Kremlin continuing to push for Ukraine to cede territory in the east which it still controls - something Kyiv has long-maintained it will never do.The talks in Moscow on Tuesday come hours after Russian officials claimed to have captured the key strategic town of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, known in Russian as Krasnoarmeysk, and the north-eastern Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk.Ukrainian officials made no acknowledgement that either city had fallen to Russia and open-source intelligence projects monitoring the front lines of the war suggested neither Vovchansk nor Pokrovsk had yet been fully captured by the Russian army. The head of Ukraine's centre for countering disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said it seemed Russia's main aim was to ensure all the pressure in the US peace plan was put on Ukraine.Russia has spent almost a year and a half trying to capture Pokrovsk and released a video showing Putin visiting a command post at the weekend in which he was quoted as saying Russia had made progress in \"an important area, we all understand just how important\".Ahead of his trip to Moscow, Witkoff also held talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Zelensky and Ukraine's new chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, while several key European leaders virtually joined the Zelensky-Macron meeting. Speaking on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the draft peace deal had \"been very much refined\", adding: \"I think the administration feels very optimistic.\" She continued: \"But as for the details, I will let the negotiators negotiate. But we do feel quite good, and we're hopeful that this war can finally come to an end.\"Last week, Putin said he had seen a draft peace plan proposed by the US, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.However, Kremlin officials later cast doubt over whether it would accept the proposal after Kyiv and European allies said they had secured changes to it.The initial US-Russia draft peace plan circulated in November sparked consternation in Kyiv and around Europe.As well as being heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, it also dictated how several billion in frozen Russian assets currently held in European financial institutions should be invested, as well as setting the terms for Ukrainian market access in Europe.Speaking on Monday, Macron said there was currently \"no finalised peace plan to speak of\", and insisted that any such proposal could only be worked out with input from Ukraine and Europe.Macron said the question of territorial concessions could \"only be finalised by President Zelensky\", and pointed out that questions around frozen Russian assets, security guarantees, and Ukraine's accession to the EU needed to involve European nations.The French leader also praised efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict, which began in 2014 with Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, followed by a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said this week could be \"pivotal\", but that Moscow only wanted to negotiate \"with those who are just offering them something on top of what they already have\". She continued: \"I'm afraid all the pressure will be put on the weaker side because that is the easier way to stop this war when Ukraine surrenders, but this is not in anybody's interest.\"In recent months Moscow has at times appeared to engage with US attempts to mediate an agreement to end the war, but several of its demands directly counter Ukraine's sovereignty and are seen as unacceptable by Kyiv.While the question of territory is the major sticking point, the issue of security guarantees for Kyiv has also proved contentious.Kyiv and its European partners are keen for Ukraine to be given security guarantees - such as Nato membership - that would protect it from being attacked again.But Russia vehemently opposes this and Trump has also ruled out allowing Ukraine to join the military alliance.",

    "body": "At least 12 people have died and around 50 are still missing after a landslide struck two boats docked at a river port in Peru's Amazon rainforest region, local media reports.The landslide sank a ferry and seriously damaged another passenger vessel that had dozens of people on board, according to a police report cited by the Andina news agency.It happened at around 05:00 local time (10:00 GMT) as passengers were set to disembark at Iparia, in the country's central Ucayali region on Monday.The injured have been taken to hospital while national police and the Peruvian Navy look for more survivors. It is feared that children are among the missing.The landslide was caused by \"erosion\" of the bank of the Ucayali River - the headwater of the Amazon - the country's National Emergency Operations Center said on X.Some 50 people were on board one of the boats, according to news agency AFP.Rescue operations have been hindered by the fast-flowing river waters, a navy official told AFP.Children, teachers and doctors were among the passengers, the Reuters news agency reports, citing Andina.Authorities are working with families gathered at the scene of the disaster to try to determine exactly how many people still need to be found.One of the boats had departed Pucallpa to the north on Sunday and was travelling towards the riverside communities of Caco Macaya, Curiaca del Caco, and Pueblo Nuevo del Caco, local media reports.",

    "body": "2 days agoHafsa KhalilReutersAt least 146 people are now known to have died in the devastating fire that tore through high-rise buildings in Hong Kong on Wednesday.Police announced the new death toll on Sunday, cautioning that they \"cannot rule out the possibility of further fatalities\". There are still 150 people missing, and the blaze left 79 injured.Seven of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in the northerly Tai Po district rapidly went up in flames. Accusations that the fire was spread by flammable construction materials have sparked widespread anger.Three days of national mourning started on Saturday, and thousands have gathered at the scene to mourn the victims.There have been queues stretching a long as 2km (1.2 miles), as people wait to lay flowers and handwritten notes.Indonesian worker Romlah Rosidah said she was \"very surprised\" at how many people had turned up to pray for the victims.\"This event was only spread on social media, but [it] turned out their hearts moved,\" she told news agency Reuters.A Filipino worker said they had joined the prayers to \"show the Hong Kong community that we are one in this situation\".Officials observed three minutes' silence to begin the mourning period, and the flags of China and Hong Kong are flying at half-staff.The fire is Hong Kong's deadliest in more than 70 years, and the death toll has been rising each day, as officials work to recover and identify bodies.The exact cause of the blaze has yet to be determined. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovations that had been taking place on the towers, while three others were detained on manslaughter charges.Ching Sze Yip/BBCChing Sze Yip/BBCAmong the tributes added are handwritten messages for the victims of the fireHundreds of flower bouquets have been laid down as people queue to mourn and pay their respectsThe fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.Police official Tsang Shuk-yin said on Sunday that officers had so far completed searches of four of the tower blocks.Indonesia's consulate in Hong Kong said at least seven of its nationals had died from the fire, while the Philippines' consulate said one of its citizens had died.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.The fire department said the blaze had reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F), and 12 firefighters were injured.The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on plastic netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.The buildings were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction work in Hong Kong. The fire has renewed a debate about whether it should still be used.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said that those arrested in the corruption investigation included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors. A police spokesperson previously said they had reason to believe \"those in charge at the company were grossly negligent\", which led to the fire and caused it to \"spread uncontrollably\".Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Separately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry into the fire.Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died. ",

    "body": "19 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéAFP via Getty ImagesAnicet Ekane's  family was given little explanation - \"his wife was just presented the corpse\", his lawyer told the BBCLeft-wing Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane has died in detention, five weeks after he was arrested, his lawyers and party have announced.Ekane, 74, was among the leaders of an opposition coalition who endorsed Issa Tchiroma Bakary in October's presidential election.Tchiroma Bakary says he was the rightful winner of the poll, officially won by 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya. Tchiroma Bakary has since fled to The Gambia.No official cause of Ekane's death has been announced. His party has accused the authorities of denying him access to his medication - a charge the government has denied.According to a spokesman for Ekane's African Movement for New Independence and Democracy (Manidem) party, Ekane died on Monday morning at a military medical facility, after his health worsened over the weekend.\"We have no clarification... His wife had been called to come and when she found herself there, she was just presented the corpse of her husband,\" he said.He added that the family later took the corpse to the mortuary.Defence ministry spokesman Capt Cyrille Serge Atonfack said the Manidem leader had died from illness, but did not give any further details.\"The deceased, who suffered from various chronic pathologies, had been interned at the Military Medical Centre of the National Gendarmerie,\" he said, adding that the politician had been well taken care of by doctors since his arrest on 24 October.Minister of Communication and government spokesperson René Emmanuel Sadi later expressed the government's condolences to Ekane's family, as well as the Manidem party.He also said that Ekane had received proper medical attention from both his personal doctors and those at the military hospital where he was admitted, adding that an investigation had been launched to determine the exact circumstances of Ekane's death.Renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna described Ekane's death as \"the extinguishing of a fierce and passionate flame\" that burned for democratic emancipation.Muna said in a statement that Ekane had informed him of his ill-health during their last conversation.\"One would have thought that basic humanity, the fundamental presumption of innocence, and the undeniable evidence of his failing health would have compelled his release to his family and the care of the medical experts who knew his condition,\" Muna said.According to Ekane's lawyers, he was accused of hostility against the state, incitement to revolt, and calls for insurrection.\"He was never presented before a judge or charged with any misdemeanour,\" said one of his lawyers, Hippolyte Meli, in a statement on social media, describing the detention of the Manidem party leader as \"illegal\".In recent weeks, rumours had circulated that the opposition figure had died, and Ekane's party members had demanded to see him \"dead or alive\".His death has sent shockwaves across the nation, with supporters gathering at the party headquarters in Douala to grieve. Others have taken to venting their anger online.Manidem says its premises have been surrounded by security forces.AFP via Getty ImagesOpposition protesters accused the ruling party of rigging the elections to ensure Paul Biya stayed in powerEkane initially endorsed another vibrant opposition figure, Maurice Kamto, for the presidential election. But Kamto, who endured a long detention after disputing the previous election in 2018, had his candidacy rejected upfront this time by both the electoral body, Elecam, and the Constitutional Council, on the grounds that the party had endorsed more than one candidate.Ekane and other politicians went on to create the Union for Change Coalition, which named former government spokesman Tchiroma Bakary as its candidate.At least 48 people were killed by Cameroon's security forces during protests against the re-election of President Biya, according to the UN.This included a number of people shot dead near Tchiroma Bakary's residence in the city of Garoua. He later claimed that snipers had been stationed at the house across from his, and were \"firing at point-blank range at the people\".The Cameroonian government has denied any wrongdoing.

    "body": "US Navy admiral ordered second  deadly Venezuela boat strike, White House says4 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: White House defends Venezuela boat strikes, says Admiral Bradley acted legallyA top US Navy admiral ordered a second round of strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat, the White House has confirmed.The \"double tap\" strike on 2 September has drawn bipartisan scrutiny among US lawmakers. The Washington Post recently reported that two people survived the first blast and were still clinging to the burning vessel when they were killed, raising fresh legality questions.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth authorised the strikes but did not give an order to \"kill everybody\", as the report said.\"Admiral (Frank) Bradley worked well within his authority and the law\" in ordering the additional strike, Leavitt said.More than 80 people have been killed in a number of similar strikes in the Caribbean Sea since early September. Each announcement from US officials is usually accompanied by  grainy video, but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking, and few details on who or what was on board each vessel.The Trump administration says it is acting in self-defence by destroying boats carrying illicit drugs to the US.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern over the report of the 2 September incident and have vowed congressional reviews of the strikes.\"President (Donald) Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war,\" Leavitt said during the Monday press briefing.The press secretary neither confirmed the first strike left two survivors, nor that the second attack was intended to kill them.Media reports that Hegseth had given the directive to kill all those on board the vessel during the 2 September strike have renewed concerns about the legality of US military strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.Hegseth has pushed back against accusations in the report, calling them \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory\". On Monday, he tweeted that Admiral Bradley \"is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. \"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"Trump: Hegseth said he 'did not order the death of those two men'In recent weeks the US has expanded its military presence in the Caribbean, as part of what it calls an anti-narcotics operation.Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\".Over the weekend, the Senate Armed Services Committee said it would be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts\" related to the 2 September strikes. Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Roger Wicker, said on Monday that the lawmakers are planning to interview the \"admiral that was in charge of the operation\". He added that it was also seeking audio and video to \"see what the orders were\".The Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives also said it would lead a \"bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question\".The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a body of the highest-ranking US military officers, met both the House and Senate's armed services committees over the weekend. Discussions centred around the operations in the region and \"the intent and legality of missions to disrupt illicit trafficking networks\", the group said. Multiple experts who spoke to the BBC have raised serious doubts that the second strike on alleged survivors could be considered legal under international law. The survivors may have been subject to protections provided to shipwrecked sailors, or to those given to troops who have been rendered unable to continue fighting.The Trump administration has said its operations in the Caribbean is a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers.The rules of engagement in such armed conflicts - as set out in the Geneva Conventions - forbid the targeting of wounded participants, saying that those participants should instead be apprehended and cared for.Under former-President Barack Obama, the US military came under scrutiny for firing multiple rounds from drones, in a practice known as the \"double tap\", that sometimes resulted in civilian casualties. On Sunday, Venezuela's National Assembly condemned the boat strikes and vowed to carry out a \"rigorous and thorough investigation\" into the 2 September strikes.The Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government. In an interview with BBC Newsnight on Monday, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said Trump's allegations stem from \"great envy\" for the country's natural resources.He also called for a direct dialogue between the US and Venezuelan governments, \"to clear the toxic atmosphere we have witnessed since July of last year\".On Sunday, Trump confirmed that he had held a brief phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in which he pressured him to resign and leave Venezuela with his family. According to reports, during the call last month, Trump told Maduro that he could go to a destination of his choosing, but only if he agreed to depart immediately. After he refused, Trump posted on social media that the airspace over Venezuela should be considered \"closed in its entirety\".Maduro requested amnesty for his top aides, and that he be allowed to continue control of the military after giving up the government. Trump refused both demands,  according to The Miami Post and Reuters, reporting the BBC has not confirmed. US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of a \"terrorist\" organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking. Maduro has denied the claims.With additional reporting by Lucy Gilder and Thomas Copeland",

    "body": "'Hung by my wrists and beaten': Israeli-Russian woman says Iraqi militants tortured her in captivity3 hours agoTim FranksBBC NewshourBBCElizabeth Tsurkov spoke to the BBC from Israel, where she is recovering from her ordealAn Israeli-Russian woman held captive for two and a half years by militants in Iraq has told the BBC how she invented \"confessions\" to try to get her captors to stop torturing her. Elizabeth Tsurkov, who was freed in September, says she suffered extreme abuse for 100 days, leaving her physically and mentally scarred.Warning: This article contains distressing content including descriptions of torture\"My health is not great,\" Ms Tsurkov says. The interview she gave to BBC Newshour was conducted in central Israel, propped  up on a bed. It is now almost three months after her release from captivity in Iraq, where she was held for 903 days. The first four and a half months had been particularly brutal: she was, she says, trussed and hung from the ceiling, whipped, sexually abused, electrocuted.In March 2023, Ms Tsurkov, a 39-year-old doctoral student at Princeton University in the US, was living in Baghdad, conducting fieldwork for her PhD in comparative politics. She agreed to meet a woman who described herself as a friend of a friend. The woman never showed up. Ms Tsurkov started walking home. She says that a car pulled up behind her and two men dragged her in, beating and sexually assaulting her. She was driven to the outskirts of the capital.\"During the first month, they starved me and interrogated me, but at the time they didn't know about my Israeli citizenship. They're simply convinced that all foreigners are spies.\" Ms Tsurkov had insisted that she was a Russian citizen. But then the kidnappers accessed her phone, and \"because I'm not a spy and don't have multiple encrypted devices, everything showed that I'm Israeli\".She says that was when the torture started: electrocutions, beatings, whippings, sexual abuse and what she calls Middle Eastern \"specialities\". \"Being hung from the ceiling with hands cuffed behind my back. Being hung with the hands above my head.\" And \"a particular method that is used in Iraq. It's called 'the scorpion'. You get handcuffed with [your] shoulders crossed behind the back. It often leads to dislocation of shoulders.\"Elizabeth TsurkovMs Tsurkov was carrying out fieldwork for her PhD in Baghdad when she was kidnappedMs Tsurkov believes she was held by members of Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iran-backed militias in Iraq, designated a terrorist organisation by the US and others. These militias are part of the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces and are widely seen in the country as wielding considerable behind-the-scenes power in government and in commerce.In the brief periods between torture, she tried to strategise. \"I had to learn all sorts of weird conspiracy theories. They live in an alternative reality in which Israel and the United States and Saudi Arabia together created ISIS [the Islamic State group], and the US spreads homosexuality through single sex cafes.\"She created confessions about herself to try to avoid torture, based on spy plots and her captors' \"quite insane worldview\", while not implicating any Iraqis. Many of her friends, she says, were activists whom the militants also wanted to kidnap and torture.But her strategy had one major downside. \"They would torture me so I would give them these confessions that I would invent, and then they simply got greedy. So, they would return, hang me by my wrists and start beating me with a stick and using even harsher methods of torture and saying, 'I want something new.'\"Ms Tsurkov says she does not understand why, after 100 days of abuse, she was moved to another location. She was still in solitary confinement with no outside light, but the torture stopped.What she is certain about is how she came to be released. The US businessman Mark Savaya, who campaigned for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, was appointed US special envoy to Iraq this October.According to Ms Tsurkov, one month before, he had travelled to Baghdad to speak to Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Among the messages he conveyed, she says, was that President Trump was extremely annoyed about her captivity, and that if she were not freed within a week, the leadership of Kataib Hezbollah would be killed. Within days, she was released.When he announced Ms Tsurkov's freedom from captivity on 9 September, Iraq's prime minister described it as \"a culmination of extensive efforts exerted by our security services over the course of many months\". He also stressed Iraq's commitment to law enforcement and state authority.He made no mention of Kataib Hezbollah or any US threat. But two weeks later, a senior official in Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Ali al-Askari, put out a statement saying that Sudani's government had sought Ms Tsurkov's release in order to prevent a US strike on Iraq and to oblige the US to comply with its agreement to withdraw its forces from the country. He also claimed that Ms Tsurkov had been released after \"giving out all the information she had\" under interrogation by the \"entity\" holding her.The US State Department did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.ReutersPresident Trump said Ms Tsurkov was held by Iraqi militia Kataib HezbollahMs Tsurkov's long road to rehabilitation - mental and physical - is beginning in Israel. But she is determined to complete her PhD at Princeton. Since her release, she has watched the parties associated with the Iran-backed militias grow in strength in recent parliamentary elections in Iraq.  More broadly, she says, it is ordinary Iraqis who lose out from a \"horribly corrupt system in an incredibly rich country\", where the commanders of the militias \"continue to operate above the law\".Ms Tsurkov, who has lived in Israel since her release, says she sees a country transformed in the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 and Israel's protracted war in Gaza. \"I'm undergoing therapy, and many of the kind of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are collectively experienced by Israelis since October 7th. There's a great sense of insecurity and desire to unleash the anger that exists within people.\" Ms Tsurkov has been a long-standing critic of Israeli government policy towards Palestinians and within the region. She has a wide circle of Palestinian, Lebanese and Iraqi friends. She's worked for the Israel NGO Gisha, which campaigns to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians.The events of the last two years have, she says, left her much more pessimistic about the possibility of peace. \"October 7th was a literal massacre of the left, because many of the people who live in the kibbutzim, the communities along the Gaza border, were peace activists. And it's a massacre of the left in the sense that the voices who support peace have gotten much weaker and more demonised.\"More immediately, she has her own recovery to concentrate on. She had, she says, previously worked with victims of torture. \"But nothing prepares you for the horror of undergoing it.\" She also reveals the toll of the false confessions. \"It kind of seeps through in some way; maybe like the situation of a battered wife who internalises to some extent the view of the abuser of herself.\"There is one key fact to cling to: that she got out. \"For sure, I have more recovery ahead of me. But I think I was lucky, in a very unlucky situation.\"",

    "body": "54 minutes agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgA radio presenter with South Africa's public broadcaster has appeared in court on a charge related to the alleged recruitment of men for the Russian military. Nonkululeko Patricia Mantula is among five people who prosecutors say are facing charges for contravening a law which prohibits South Africans from joining a foreign army without official permission. They have not yet been asked to plead.The arrests are the first since the South African government said in November that 17 citizens had \"seemingly\" been lured to join mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine war. Police told the BBC that at this stage, they are not linking the two cases.  Mantula, 39, is a presenter of The Morning Bliss, a show on the SABC's SAFM radio station.  In a statement emailed to the BBC, the SABC said that she was a freelance presenter.\"As this is a personal issue before the courts, the corporation will allow due processes to unfold and has no further comment at this stage,\" it added.Mantula has not commented.Her arrest, along with four others, follows the dramatic resignation from parliament last Friday of Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma, who has been accused of duping the 17 South African men - including some of her relatives - into fighting for Russia, an allegation she denies. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said that Mantula had been arrested with four men, aged between 21 and 46.They each face a charge of contravening the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act.The NPA said the arrests followed a tip-off from police at South Africa's main international airport in Johannesburg.They were \"intercepted\" as they attempted to travel to Russia via the United Arab Emirates, and \"were removed from the boarding gate after being deemed suspicious\", it added.The NPA said it was further alleged that Mantula \"had been facilitating the travel and recruitment of her co-accused into the Russian Federation military\".Mantula and her co-accused appeared briefly at the Kempton Park Magistrates' Court near Johannesburg on Monday, and were remanded in custody.The NPA said it was \"committed to ensuring that individuals who violate the laws of the country are held accountable and will continue to work with other law-enforcement partners to protect the integrity and security\" of South Africa. The accused are due to make their next court appearance on 8 December for a bail application. In November, South Africa's government said it had received distress calls from 17 citizens who were trapped in Ukraine's war-torn Donbas region after joining mercenary forces.It added that it was working through \"diplomatic channels\" to bring them back, but this has not yet happened. The men were lured to join the mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative contracts, the government said, adding that it condemned \"the exploitation of young vulnerable people by individuals working with foreign military entities\".South Africa has an unemployment rate of more than 30%, which is even higher among young people.Zuma-Sambudla's resignation as an MP came after her half-sister, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube, filed a complaint with police, accusing her of tricking the 17 men to fight for Russia as mercenaries.Zuma-Mncube said that eight of them were members of her family, and they had been \"handed to a Russian mercenary group to fight in the Ukraine war without their knowledge or consent\".South Africa's elite police unit, the Hawks, said the case was being investigated by its officers who focus on \"crime against the state\". Zuma-Sambudla, who became a member of parliament for the largest opposition party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), last year, has said in an affidavit that she thought the men were going to Russia for \"lawful\" training.MK says it was her decision to resign as she wants to focus her efforts on ensuring the return of those trapped in a war zone.In September, Kenyan police said they had rescued more than 20 people from a suspected trafficking ring that had lured them with job offers in Russia but intended to send them to fight in Ukraine.Ukraine has previously said that it was holding citizens of various countries - Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka - at prisoner-of-war camps.It has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.In 2022, Senegal's foreign ministry said it had summoned Kyiv's ambassador to demand the withdrawal of an embassy post on Facebook urging foreigners to enlist for its war effort.At the time, Nigeria also warned that it would not tolerate Ukraine's recruitment drive, forcing it to back-pedal.",

    "body": "2 days agoBob HowardDublinNurPhoto via Getty ImagesJack likes a drink and a standard night out will probably involve several pints at his local.\"If you have three pints, that is easy, easy going,\" the 29-year-old says. \"Probably a heavy night, casually, would be like six-plus pints.\"Jack grew up in County Galway where, he says, young people often start drinking at 14 or 15, \"usually in a field with a horrendous can of cider\".\"And then, when you're 17, your dad brings you to a pub, buys you your pint of Guinness, and that's where it takes hold.\"Ireland has a complex relationship with drinking and many see alcohol and socialising as inextricably linked, part of the social fabric of everyday life.Pubs tend to be the focal point of communities where there's often live music, and many traditional songs celebrate or speak of the harms of having one too many. Huge brands such as Guinness and Jamesons are major exports.Since 2020 supermarkets and corner shops across the country have had to erect physical barriers between sections selling alcoholic drinks and general products, while some bottles and cans of alcohol now carry among the strongest warning labels anywhere in the world.First signed into Irish law in 2023, products with the new labels - which state drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers - are already on sale in pubs and supermarkets across the country.But in a move condemned by public health advocates, the Irish government has delayed their compulsory introduction until 2028, blaming uncertainty with world trade - which some believe is the result of lobbying by the drinks industry.For its part, the industry body, Drinks Ireland, said it did look to the Irish government to give some \"breathing space\" on health warning labels and that it believes they should be agreed on an EU-wide level.Labels warn of the link between alcohol and fatal cancers, and advise it can cause liver disease and affect foetusesIt was when Jack moved to Dublin in 2015 to study journalism that he really got to know the capital's nightlife.\"Dublin's a great spot because it's always spontaneous drinking, and that's why it's famous,\" he says. \"It's very pub-centric, drink-heavy.\"A big weekend night out for Jack usually begins with pre-drinks at someone's house - perhaps a bottle of gin mixed with tonic shared between him and three friends - before going on to a club for shots.Yet even though he sometimes drinks a considerable amount, Jack, who works in advertising, says he knows his limits and feels healthy.\"I'm a pretty fit person, I ran a marathon a year ago,\" he says. \"As long as you know what your limits are, I think its fine, health-wise.\"Jack outside a bar on Drury Street in the centre of DublinThree-quarters of the population here drink and celebrations, from birthdays to weddings, often involve alcohol.Consumption has fallen by around a third over the past 25 years, according to figures from The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland (DIGI).Young people, on average, now start drinking at 17 - two years older than the average 20 years ago. But once they start, their consumption and binge drinking is among the highest in Europe.A report from public health advocacy group Alcohol Action Ireland found the proportion of 15-24-year-olds consuming alcohol had risen - from 66% in 2018, to 75% in 2024 - and that two out of three 15-24-year-olds regularly binge-drink.Campaigners believe Ireland's alcohol warning labels are making an incremental impact. But 23-year-old Amanda, who's seen the labels, isn't so sure.\"You look at it and you're like, 'Oh, I just drank that. Should I drink another one?'\"Amanda doesn't think people will pay much attention to the health warnings and reckons they might even make some more inclined to drink.\"I just don't think they care,\" she says.On a night out in Dublin Amanda says she will usually limit herself to a maximum of three drinks.\"I like to be in control of what I do when I'm out,\" she says. \"I don't really drink that much for letting loose.\"She's mindful of how young people are perceived on social media, and that influences her own drinking choices.\"I don't like taking photos with myself with a glass of wine or Guinness,\" she says. \"You don't want to be in compromising positions, you don't want people to have a negative image.\"Amanda has seen the new warning labels on alcohol - but isn't sure how effective they'll beTwenty-one-year-old Sean lives in the capital and likes to socialise with friends - some are drinkers, while others are not.Unlike in other parts of Europe, Sean says if you want to socialise in the evenings there aren't many options here, other than going to the pub.\"There's not much to do in Dublin after a certain time,\" Sean says. \"Six to seven or so the city kind of shuts down. At times you'd just be like, 'I'm really not in the humour to have a pint, but I want to sit somewhere and see my friends' - so you have to get a pint.\"He's seen the alcohol warning labels too, but isn't sure they will put him off drinking.\"Everyone kinda knows it's bad for you, but we do it anyway,\" he says.Cigarette warning labels are \"far more graphic\", Sean's friend Mark adds.Ireland was the front-runner in restricting smoking and since 2004 you can't smoke in the workplace or restaurants and bars.Sean (left) with friends Mark, Ted, Nikita, Darragh and James in a courtyard near Temple Bar, Dublin's nightlife hub Even before the introduction of the new warning labels, some young Irish people in their 20s have been finding they are better off without alcohol in their lives.Mark rarely drinks. It's \"one for my birthday, one for Christmas\", he says, in part because alcohol is expensive and it's cheaper to opt for something else.\"I don't really like the taste of it,\" the 21-year-old says. \"Guinness is probably the one I would have, but also the cost of it - I am saving so much money by just getting the Club Orange.\"Helen is 27 and when she was younger used to drink regularly. Although she hasn't given up alcohol completely, like Mark she says she can largely live without it.\"The last time I had a drink was February,\" Helen says. \"It just kind of dwindled off to this point where I'm more or less sober, but I just don't identify as that because I may have a drink again - or maybe I won't.\"Sam and Helen are good friends who encourage each other not to drinkHelen's friend Sam - who started drinking when he was \"16 or 17\" - has gone a step further.\"It was a bit of fun then [I] went to college and the drinking kind of took off,\" Sam, who's now 27, says. \"One day I just kind of realised it was going too far. My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life? You really need to pack it in.'\"In 2021 Sam signed up to a year-long no-beer course and then quit alcohol completely. He's not had a drink now in three years and has even given up playing the concertina in pubs because it was so ingrained to have a drink at a session. When he does go to a pub he'll opt for a zero-alcohol drink.But he says it sometimes seems difficult for people to accept he's teetotal.\"There's the odd person that you meet and you tell them you're not drinking and they kind of look at you sideways.\"Unlike Sam, Jack's not keen on zero-alcohol drinks, and thinks they're \"a waste of time, because it's the same price as a pint\".He's thought about giving up drinking, but his inner resolve never lasts long.\"Honestly, it's quite difficult to try and embark on the sober journey in Ireland - because it is intrinsically entwined into our culture,\" Jack says.\"I always kind of flirt with the idea of going totally sober - but then I instantly dissuade [myself] and have a pint.\"Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe BBC asked the Irish government why it had postponed the compulsory introduction of the new alcohol warning labels until 2028. It said the decision to defer was made following concerns raised about the impact of their implementation in the current global trading environment.More weekend picks",

    "description": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor ",
    "body": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor for New Jersey - a ruling likely to affect scores of criminal cases in the state.The president handpicked Habba for the role of US attorney this year, but a district court rejected her nomination, so the Trump administration installed her in a role that allowed her to fill in on an acting basis.The appellate judges found on Monday that this tactic, which bypassed confirmation by the US Senate, violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba is the second Trump-appointed prosecutor to be disqualified in recent weeks.\"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" one of the appellate judges, Judge Michael Fisher, wrote in Monday's ruling disqualifying Habba. The BBC has contacted Habba's office, the White House, and the Department of Justice for comment. In a joint statement, three lawyers who had challenged Habba's authority - Abbe David Lowell, Gerry Krovatin, and Norm Eisen - wrote that this marks \"the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions\".The statement continued: \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported US Attorneys wherever appropriate.\"Habba, 41, first joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. She went on to represent Trump in his hush-money trial in New York last year, when he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction. Before Habba took on the role of US Attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as \"unwavering in her loyalty\" and a \"tireless advocate for justice\".Monday's ruling may force the justice department to find a new prosecutor to supervise federal criminal cases in New Jersey. The appellate court's decision came after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey argued that the prosecutor's appointment was unlawful, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.A federal judge ruled in their favour in August. That order had been on hold while the appeals court heard the case. Habba is not the first Trump-appointed US prosecutor to face a legal challenge. A federal judge last week dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that the US attorney in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed as interim US attorney in Virginia. In October, a US district judge disqualified Bill Essayli from his role as acting US attorney for the Southern District of California, finding that he had stayed in the temporary post longer than the law allowed. But the judge allowed Essayli to continue overseeing the office - the most populous US federal judicial district, serving around 19 million people - in his role as first assistant US attorney. Defence attorneys have filed a motion to get that part of the judge's ruling reversed in an attempt to fully oust Essayli. In September, another US district judge disqualified Nevada's lead federal prosecutor Sigal Chattah, finding that she, too, was not lawfully serving as acting US attorney. ",

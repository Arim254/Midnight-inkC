    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"On Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.The corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.The BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation. \"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"The president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.A search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.A BBC spokesperson said on Saturday evening: \"We have had no further contact from President Trump's lawyers at this point. \"Our position remains the same.\"In a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"He called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.In July this year, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.Sir Craig Oliver, former BBC editor and ex-director of politics and communications for former Prime Minister David Cameron, told BBC Today programme that this is a \"nightmare\" situation for the public broadcaster. \"The problem is that public money could be spent fighting this or settling this,\" Sir Craig said, adding that Trump doesn't \"understand the BBC, how it is funded or how it works\". Watch: Trump says he will sue the BBC. Gary O'Donoghue explains what's nextThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Controversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.First it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.The BBC's apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutes",

    "body": "Thirteen people were injured, two critically, after a car crashed into a crowd during a demolition derby in southeastern Australia, police said.The car had been taking part in a race in the town of Walcha on Saturday night when it drove through a fence and hit the grandstand, New South Wales police said in a statement.The race, part of the annual Walcha Motorcycle Rally, had been a demolition derby - a type of motorsport where drivers ram their vehicles into one another.Brendan Moylan, a member of parliament for Northern Tablelands, the region where Walcha is located, said on social media on Sunday that nine people remained in hospital and \"all are now recovering\".Earlier, police put the number of injured at nine. They said the ages of the injured bystanders ranged from 20 to 75, while a critically injured person was a 54-year-old man. An investigation was under way, they said.Police said they were told that the 27-year-old driver of the car had been involved in a collision on the track right before it drove into the fence.In a statement published on the Walcha Motorcycle Rally's Facebook page, the Walcha Council said that it was \"shocked and stunned at the unfortunate accident\".The Council said it would work with authorities to \"examine the circumstances which led to the accident\". Giving any comments before concluding the inquiries would be \"inappropriate\", it said.In a post on Facebook, Moylan thanked emergency responders and other bystanders for their \"swift and incredibly professional work at the scene\". \"My thoughts are with everyone affected,\" he wrote.Barnaby Joyce, former deputy prime minister and incumbent New England lawmaker, wrote on Facebook that his \"thoughts, prayer and hopes\" were with those injured in the crash.\"Such a sad end to such a great event,\" he wrote.The Walcha Motorcycle Rally describes itself as a \"grassroots event for motorcycle enthusiasts\".",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to \"overhaul\" state-owned energy companies, after a major corruption scandal engulfed the country's energy sector.Around $100 million (£76m) has been embezzled, anti-graft investigators said, causing outrage in a country where Russian attacks have resulted in crippling power outages.\"Alongside a full audit of their financial activities, the management of these companies is to be renewed,\" Zelensky wrote in a post on X on Saturday. Energoatom, the state nuclear company at the heart of the scandal, will have a new supervisory board \"within a week,\" he added. Several of those implicated in the scandal have close links to the Ukrainian president.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" Zelensky wrote. He also called for the quick appointment of a new head of Ukrhydroenergo, a hydropower generating company, and reforms for oil and gas giant Naftogaz and the nation's Gas Transmission System Operator. Two ministers were forced to resign over the corruption scheme and a former business partner of Zelensky was sanctioned earlier this week when the scandal broke.On Monday, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the 15 month-long investigation had revealed several members of the Ukrainian government were involved.Some of those implicated in the scandal are or have been, close associates of Zelensky's. Among those alleged to be involved are Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95.Zelensky has previously said he is committed to fully cooperate with the anti-corruption investigation.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" he said on Saturday.\"The full transparency and integrity in the energy sector remain an absolute priority.\"But the scandal has brought Zelensky's commitment to fighting corruption under scrutiny once again. In July, he faced backlash after he signed a law limiting the independence of Nabu and Sap. The outrage was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate their freedom, but the debacle prompted criticism from European allies including France and Germany, while ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressed the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.",

    "body": "5 hours agoRuth Comerford and Ethirajan Anbarasan,global affairs reporterWatch: Protesters against violent crime and the Sheinbaum government clash with police in Mexico CityAt least 120 people - 100 of them police officers - have been injured in clashes during anti-government protests in Mexico City, police said.Thousands of demonstrators marched in the Mexican capital on Saturday to protest against violent crime and President Claudia Sheinbaum's government.Sheinbaum said the marches, which also took place in other cities, had been funded by right-wing politicians who oppose her government.The rally was organised by Gen Z youth groups, drawing support from citizens protesting against high-profile killings, including the assassination just weeks ago of Uruapan Mayor Carlos Manzo - who had called for tough action against cartels.Demonstrators dismantled parts of a barrier protecting the National Palace, where Sheinbaum lives. Police protecting the compound used tear gas on the crowds.Authorities have arrested 20 people for crimes including robbery and assault, Mexico City security chief Pablo Vazquez told reporters.Protesters waved banners displaying messages including \"We are all Carlos Manzo\", while others wore cowboy hats in tribute to him.Manzo was shot on 1 November while he attended a Day of the Dead festival.He was known for speaking openly about drug-trafficking gangs in his town and cartel violence. He had been demanding tough action against armed cartel members who terrorise the country. Sheinbaum has been acting against cartels but resisting calls for another all-out war on drugs. Previous attempts by her predecessors have ended with bloody results.Days before the march took place, the president said the demonstration was being promoted by bots online.\"We agree with freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration if there are young people who have demands, but the issue here is who is promoting the demonstration,\" she said in a briefing. \"People should know how this demonstration was organised so that no one is used.\"Sheinbaum retains approval ratings above 70% in her first year in office, and has made in-roads in clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, Donald Trump.But she has been criticised for failing to halt the violence gripping the country and is facing increased hostility from nearby countries.Earlier this month, Peru's Congress voted to declare Sheinbaum a persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision came days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.",

    "body": "Disagreements between Donald Trump and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene have ballooned into a public feud, signalling a breakdown in relations between the US president and one of his fiercest defenders.On Friday, Trump called Greene \"wacky\" in social media posts and said she should be unseated in next year's elections. On Saturday, he called her a \"traitor\". Greene has in recent days questioned whether Trump was still putting \"America First\" and criticised his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.The feud comes as the House is set to consider whether to release the files to the public, with speaker Mike Johnson saying he would put the bill to a vote this coming week.Known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the aim of the bill is to make the justice department release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials linked to Jeffrey Epstein.US outlet Politico reported a vote could come as soon as Tuesday. \"All I see \"Wacky\" Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" Trump posted on Friday night, claiming that she turned on him after he suggested that she shouldn't run for governor or senator in her home state of Georgia. \"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore,\" Trump said, adding: \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"He pledged to back any Republican opponent that takes her on in next year's midterm elections, when she is up for reelection, before intensifying his attacks in social media posts on Saturday from his home in Florida.\"Marjorie 'Traitor' Green [sic] is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\" he wrote.The comments follow days of criticism from Greene, who has said that Trump is not doing enough to bring down costs for voters. She also denounced his recent decisions in foreign conflicts and on tariff policies.But she has been most critical of his approach to handling the Epstein files. The turnaround is remarkable for a lawmaker who stood by Trump during multiple scandals, most notably the Capitol riot in 2021 when Trump supporters stormed the US legislature in an attempt to block Trump's election defeat. The US president also vigorously defended Greene when she was accused of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories.Greene is one of only four House Republicans who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the Epstein files last week.On Friday, Greene posted on X that Trump was trying to stop other Republicans from voting in favour of the Epstein petition.\"He's coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files,\" she posted, adding: \"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level.\"She returned to X on Saturday to say Trump had made her a target for threats \"fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world\".\"As a Republican, who overwhelmingly votes for President Trump's bills and agenda, his aggression against me... is completely shocking to everyone,\" she wrote.\"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump,\" she wrote in one post. \"I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.\"Former Republican pollster and strategist Robert Moran said it was clear the US president did not want the Epstein files to be released and \"is trying to pressure\" Greene. Mr Moran doubted the row would affect Trump's popularity as the electorate was so divided, but said it was inevitable the files would eventually come out. \"Many of his voters are sceptical of power and so they want power to be held to account, and they support the release of these files,\" he added.Trump has long faced criticism from both parties over his handling of the US Department of Justice files related to Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile. Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the US president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.",

    "body": "A major data breach in Somalia's electronic visa system may have exposed personal information belonging to tens of thousands of applicants, including US citizens, the American embassy in Somalia has warned.It said it had received credible reports that \"unidentified hackers\" had penetrated the Somali government's e-visa platform, potentially compromising data from at least 35,000 people.The leaked documents circulating online include names, photos, dates of birth, marital status, home addresses and email contacts, according to a US embassy statement issued on Thursday.\"This data breach is ongoing and could expose any personal data you enter into the system,\" the UK has also warned travellers.\"Consider the risks before applying for an e-visa required for travel to Somalia.\"Somali authorities have not commented on the breach. But the government has shifted its visa service from evisa.gov.so to etas.gov.so, without providing an official explanation.\"While Embassy Mogadishu is unable to confirm whether an individual's data is part of the breach, individuals who have applied for a Somali e-visa may be affected,\" the  US' statement said.The BBC has contacted the Somalia Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) for comment.Somalia's new system requires all travellers, including those from the self-declared republic of Somaliland and the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, to apply for entry visas online.Critics say travellers have faced extra fees in certain regions, amounting to double charges.Somaliland, which declared independence in 1991, governs itself with its own institutions but has not been internationally recognised. Somalia maintains that the region remains part of its sovereign territory.The alleged breach adds to long-running tensions between Mogadishu and Hargeisa over control of Somali airspace. While Somalia re-established full control of its airspace in 2017, Somaliland continues to contest the arrangement.The dispute escalated further this week when Somaliland's President Abdirahman Irro said Somaliland would not accept Somalia's e-visa and ordered that airlines must obtain clearance from Hargeisa before entering its airspace.Yet major airlines have refused to board passengers without Somalia's e-visa approval.On Saturday, Somaliland's Foreign Minister Abdirahman Dahir Aadan again insisted that \"anyone travelling to Somaliland will obtain their visa on arrival\", saying Somalia's e-visa system was not safe and warning that \"people's data can fall into the hands of extremist groups\" as a result of using it.The stand-off has left some travellers heading to Somaliland stranded at airports after being denied boarding for lacking Somalia's e-visa.Somaliland's Civil Aviation Minister, Fu'aad Ahmed Nuux, has told the BBC that the directives - first announced earlier this year - came into effect on 10 November.He said airlines that do not comply will be told to divert, and claimed several aircraft had already been rerouted.Footage released by Somaliland's aviation ministry appears to show local air-traffic controllers issuing instructions to international pilots - a move celebrated domestically as an assertion of Somaliland's autonomy.But the Somalia Civil Aviation Authority insists it retains sole administrative and legal control over the Mogadishu Flight Information Region (FIR), which covers the whole nation's airspace. It has ordered all aircraft to ignore any instructions issued by authorities other than Mogadishu.It warned that failing to comply with Somali and international aviation rules could pose safety risks and lead to \"serious legal consequences\".Additional reporting by Natasha Booty.",

    "body": "2 days agoIone WellsSouth America CorrespondentAFP via Getty ImagesTens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud were unleashed through communities surrounding the damMining company BHP has been found liable for a 2015 dam collapse in Brazil, known as the country's worst-ever environmental disaster, by London's High Court.The dam collapse killed 19 people, polluted the river and destroyed hundreds of homes.The civil lawsuit, representing more than 600,000 people including civilians, local governments and businesses, had been valued at up to £36bn ($48bn).BHP said it would appeal against the ruling and continue to fight the lawsuit and has said many claimants in the London lawsuit had already been paid compensation in Brazil.The dam in Mariana, southeastern Brazil, was owned by Samarco, a joint venture between the mining giants Vale and BHP.The claimants' lawyers argued successfully that the trial should be held in London because BHP headquarters \"were in the UK at the time of the dam collapse\".A separate claim against Samarco's second parent company, Brazilian mining company Vale, was filed in the Netherlands, with more than 70,000 plaintiffs.The dam was used to store waste from iron ore mining. When it burst, it unleashed tens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud. The sludge swept through communities, destroying hundreds of people's homes and poisoning the river.Judge Finola O'Farrell said in her High Court ruling that continuing to raise the height of the dam when it was not safe to do so was the \"direct and immediate cause\" of the dam's collapse, meaning BHP was liable under Brazilian law.BHP is expected to appeal the ruling. President of BHP's Minerals Americas, Brandon Craig, said in a statement that 240,000 claimants in the London lawsuit \"have already been paid compensation in Brazil\".\"We believe this will significantly reduce the size and value of claims in the UK group action,\" he added.The lawsuit has been littered with different clashes between the UK firm representing the claimants, Pogust Goodhead, and BHP. BHP always denied liability and said the London lawsuit duplicated legal proceedings and reparation and repair programmes in Brazil.BHP and Vale have set up an organisation called the Renova Foundation tasked with compensating victims. It has offered them either cash compensation, or a house in a new city that the foundation has built to replace the town of Novo Bento and has disbursed billions of dollars in repair and compensation actions to hundreds of thousands of people.In June, a presentation by BHP and Vale's Samarco venture said around 130,000 people in Brazil had reached settlements with them. In response, Pogust Goodhead alleged the companies had pressured claimants to \"settle their claims at far below their true value\" and that it would seek £1.3bn in unpaid fees lost as a result.It alleged that a $30.3bn compensation agreement which Brazil signed with BHP, Vale and Samarco in October 2024 prevented claimants from discussing the deal with the firm or paying its legal fees.The firm said it had incurred $1bn in borrowing costs to finance the English case.BHP said it rejected Pogust Goodhead's allegations in their entirety and dispute \"their factual and legal basis.\"It said the claims were \"without merit\" and BHP would \"vigorously contest them.\" A spokesperson also said that the firm continued to believe Brazil was the most appropriate, effective, and efficient place for compensation for the dam collapse.AFP via Getty ImagesSome of those affected by the disaster travelled to the High Court last yearBut there were also parallel claims that Pogust Goodhead – which promotes itself as a firm representing human rights and environmental law – had tried to profit off \"vulnerable\" Brazilians.During proceedings the firm was accused of \"misleading\" vulnerable Brazilians for its own gain by a Brazilian judge in the state of Minas Gerais.Pogust Goodhead rejected the accusation at the time as \"without merit\". In a claim brought by the Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders in Brazil against Pogust Goodhead, the judge criticised several \"allegedly abusive clauses\" in Pogust Goodhead's contracts with Brazilians who suffered damage.Among these, it alleges the law firm engaged in \"misleading advertising\" considering the \"hypervulnerability of those affected\".It also alleges \"undue charging of fees on compensation amounts obtained extrajudicially in Brazil\" which it said represents \"illicit enrichment that diverts essential resources from those affected\" and \"excessive\" penalties for claimants who terminated their contracts which it said \"discouraged\" them from joining national compensation programmes.The former Brazilian ambassador in London and Washington, Rubens Barbosa, told the BBC earlier this year that he believed this amounted to spreading misleading information in Brazil.Mr Barbosa said bringing the case to London \"hinders efforts to resolve the matter locally\" and the \"extremely vulnerable Brazilians were misled\" by contracts.",

    "body": "A bus driver arrested after three people were killed and another three injured in a crash in Stockholm on Friday has been released.Authorities are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the incident after a bus crashed into a bus stop queue on Valhallavägen street in the Swedish capital.The Swedish Prosecution Authority said on Saturday there was \"no reason\" to keep the driver, who had been questioned by police, in custody but that \"certain investigative measures remain\".The man had been arrested on suspicion of three counts of causing death and three of causing bodily harm. Police said there was no reason to think the incident was intentional. Officials are still trying to establish the identities of the victims. The bus was not in service at the time and no passengers were on board, local media report. The crash happened near the Royal Institute of Technology university at about 15:23 (14:23 GMT).Images from the scene show rescue crews appearing to help people trapped underneath the double-decker bus.A witness who owns a shop on the street told SVT the bus hit a pole in front of the bus shelter. They said several people ran into the shop crying.A woman told the local Expressen newspaper that the bus \"mowed down an entire bus stop queue\". She said people were screaming and trying to help the injured, while dead people lay on the ground.\"There must have been more people under the bus,\" she said.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.\"People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home. We do not yet know the cause, but right now my thoughts are primarily with those affected and their loved ones,\" he posted on X.",

The explosion happened on Friday evening at Nowgam police station, and the explosives were seized from Faridabad in the northern state of Haryana earlier in the week. The region's director general of police, Nalin Prabhat, said the explosives were being sent for forensic examination - but due to a \"very unfortunate\" mishap during handling they detonated at around 23:20 local time (17:50 GMT).Police said in a statement that it was an accidental detonation, not a terrorist attack. \"Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,\" the police chief told journalists.The police station suffered severe damage in the explosion and adjacent buildings were also affected, he said.Multiple vehicles were \"engulfed in flames and reduced to charred husks, with debris scattered across the site\", according to a police statement. \"The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station,\" a source told Reuters news agency. Most of the victims were police officers, along with forensic personnel, two crime scene photographers, and a tailor who was with the team. Manoj Sinha, the region's Lieutenant Governor appointed by the Indian government, expressed his condolences and said he had ordered an investigation. \"I have ordered a probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion. Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to extremely tragic accidental blast at Nowgam police station in Srinagar. My condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured,\" he wrote on social media.",

    "body": "18 hours agoPaulin Kola and Kayla EpsteinGetty / BBCFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers (left), Former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler (centre) and journalist Michael Wolff (right) have all been named in the Epstein documents released by CongressUS lawmakers have released more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of the disgraced financier and convicted late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Some of the documents mention Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the former prince and brother of King Charles; US President Donald Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment, who highlight the extent of Epstein's contact book.Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in about 2004, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Here are some of the the other names that came up, which does not indicate wrongdoing by any of the parties mentioned.Michael Wolff Reuters\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" Wolff said on WednesdayMichael Wolff, 72, is an American journalist and columnist - as well as a prolific author of books on the wealthy and the famous.Fire and Fury, the first of several books spanning Trump's first stint as US president, came out in 2018, with descriptions of a dysfunctional White House and salacious details about the US commander-in-chief. Trump said it was \"full of lies\".The new batch of files related to Jeffrey Epstein shed light on a relationship that appears to indicate a correspondence between Wolff and the late convicted sex offender.Attention has focused particularly on one of the emails, in which Wolff appears to give Epstein advice in relation to Trump, as Trump was campaigning for the White House for the first time.Wolff wrote to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN was planning to ask Trump, as a presidential candidate, about his relationship with Epstein.Epstein replied: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"The two go on to discuss a strategy, with Wolff writing: \"I think you should let him hang himself.\"In a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump.Responding to the release in a video posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.In fact, Wolff disclosed before the latest presidential election in the US that he had interviewed Epstein \"periodically\" for Fire and Fury - and released tapes of those conversations.Larry SummersEPAThe documents include correspondences between Epstein and Larry Summers, who was former Democratic President Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary. It had been previously reported that the two men knew each other.The emails indicate the two met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"presidnt [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".In a separate email from late November 2016, just after Trump's election, Summers asked Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".Due to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", \"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin proximity\" and a \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".A spokesperson for Summers declined to comment, but referred the BBC to past statements by Summers. A representative told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 that the former official \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction\".Kathryn RuemmlerNBCUniversal via Getty ImagesThe House of Representatives Oversight Committee released several email exchanges between Epstein and Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer who served as White House counsel during the presidency of Barack Obama.In August 2018, Ms Ruemmler and Epstein discussed hush-money payments made by Trump to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election - an issue over which Trump was later convicted of falsifying business records. Trump denies allegations that he had an affair with Daniels.The exchange between Ms Ruemmler and Epstein culminated with Epstein writing: \"You see, I know how dirty donald is.\"The bank Goldman Sachs, where Ms Ruemmler is currently chief legal officer and general counsel, told CNBC it was standing by its employee.\"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs. Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Goldman spokesperson Tony Fratto said in a statement to CNBC.In 2023, Ms Ruemmler told the Wall Street Journal, \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\"The BBC has asked Ms Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs for further comment.Peter Thiel Nordin Catic/Getty Images for The Cambridge UnionThe name of billionaire investor and on-off Trump supporter Peter Thiel appeared again in the latest Epstein documents - having first been mentioned in a batch made public in September.According to the newly-released files, Epstein wrote to Mr Thiel in November 2018 to invite him to visit him in his Caribbean island, where some of Epstein's crimes are thought to have been committed.The BBC has asked the Thiel Foundation and the investor's Founders Fund for comment. A representative for Mr Thiel told Politico that he had never visited the island.Mr Thiel was critical of Epstein on an August 2024 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.\"You know, I met Epstein a few times as well,\" Thiel said.Mr Thiel said he was introduced to Epstein by another Silicon Valley executive in 2014.\"I didn't check, didn't ask any - enough questions about it,\" Mr Thiel said. He surmised that \"Epstein knew a lot about taxes\".Noam ChomskyRedferns via Getty ImagesNoam Chomsky in conversation with the British Library in 2013The latest document drop includes more correspondence between the famed linguist Noam Chomsky, 96, and Epstein. Many of their discussions were academic or personal.Occasionally the conversations turned to the subject of Trump, including in December 2016.In his email, Mr Chomsky tells Epstein: \"I notice your prediction was right about Trump avoiding the White House as far too primitive.\"The BBC has contacted a representative of Mr Chomsky for comment.In responses to previous reporting by the Wall Street Journal on their relationship, Mr Chomsky said Epstein had helped him move money between his accounts without \"one penny from Epstein\", and to acknowledge that \"I knew him and we met occasionally\".Peggy SiegalSean Zanni/Patrick McMullan via Getty ImagesEpstein consulted publicist Peggy Siegal as the scandal around him and his associates unfolded.Epstein wrote to Ms Siegal in 2011 asking her to contact the founder of the Huffington Post, Ariana Huffington, in order to discredit the story of Virginia Giuffre, who was a prominent accuser of Epstein and Andrew. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.Epstein told Siegal that Huffington \"should champion the dangers of false allegations...\".The email exchange shows Ms Siegal telling Epstein: \"If you rewrite your last email in better grammar, (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Ariana Huffington from me…\".In a phone interview, Ms Siegal told the BBC she had never passed Epstein's request to Huffington. \"I did not call Ariana,\" she said. Huffington \"used to publish my writing and there's no reason in the world I would jeopardise that relationship,\" Ms Siegal added.But the fact that Epstein had asked was \"not unusual. It was a ridiculous request,\" she said.\"Jeffrey had a habit of trying to ensnare people into his delusional world,\" she added.Meanwhile, Huffington told Politico she was \"was never contacted and never sent a reporter\".",

    "body": "1 day agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporter and Nardine SaadUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.The move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has focused on the issue since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.The dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.These goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Trump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.He has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead. But grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".He has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.  But the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".He added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\" \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.Economists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.While inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed price increases, with groceries up 2.7% from last year.The Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.In another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.The White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include: CoffeeCocoaBlack teaGreen teaVanilla beansBeef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meatFruits, including acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoesSpices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmericNuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts",

    "body": "Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has confirmed it seized a tanker on Friday morning in the Strait of Hormuz.The Talara tanker, sailing under the flag of the Marshall Islands, was travelling from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Singapore.The IRGC said it was found to be \"in violation of the law by carrying unauthorised cargo\", but did not provide details of the violation. Reports suggest it was carrying high-sulphur gasoil. Iran has periodically seized tankers and cargo ships travelling in and around the Persian Gulf, which is a key global shipping route for oil and liquefied natural gas. It has often cited maritime violations such as smuggling or legal issues. Maritime security company Ambrey said the Talara tanker had departed from Ajman in the United Arab Emirates and was heading south through the Strait of Hormuz when it was approached by three small boats, after which it made a \"sudden course deviation\".The US Navy's 5th fleet, which patrols the region, said on Friday it was \"actively monitoring the situation\".\"Commercial vessels are entitled to largely unimpeded rights of navigation and commerce on the high seas,\" it added. The company that manages the ship announced it had lost contact with the crew on Friday morning, while the tanker was 20 nautical miles off the coast of Sharjah's Khorfakkan port.The UK's Maritime Trade Operations Centre said it had received reports on the incident and advised vessels \"to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity\". Iran has for years threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of all traded oil passes, in retaliation for Western sanctions and other actions against it. Its threats ramped up during the 12-day conflict with Israel in June - during which Israel and United States carried out a bombing campaign on Iran's nuclear facilities, and Iran retaliated by striking Israel. In April 2024, the IRGC seized a commercial ship with links to Israel, following a deadly attack on Iran's consulate in Syria which was blamed on Israel.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLinda Pressly and Esperanza Escribano,BarcelonaBBCMarina Freixa always knew there was something dark and unspoken about her family.Her mother had grown up under Spain's decades-long dictatorship, which ended in 1975, but the details of her childhood were hazy.Then everything changed one Christmas a decade ago - when Marina was about 20.That winter's evening around the table, with a cloud of cigarette smoke suspended in the air and wine glasses drained, Marina's mother, Mariona Roca Tort, began to speak.Els Buits (documentary film)Several years ago, Mariona (left) revealed the truth about her adolescence to Marina and her cousins\"My parents reported me to the authorities,\" Mariona told them. \"They put me in a reformatory when I was 17.\"Reformatories were institutions where girls and young women who refused to conform to the Franco regime's Catholic values were detained - single mothers, girls with boyfriends, lesbians. Girls who'd been sexually assaulted were incarcerated, assuming the blame for their own abuse. Orphans and abandoned girls might also find themselves living behind convent walls.Marina and her cousins were stunned.They couldn't comprehend that their grandparents had arranged to have their own daughter locked up.Mariona's memory of telling this story to the youngsters in her family is blurred, she believes as a result of the psychiatric \"treatment\" she was forced to undergo at the reformatory. But Marina didn't forget the revelations, and years later, she would make a documentary telling her mother's story.Mariona is a survivor of the Patronato de Protección a la Mujer - the Women's Protection Board. Under dictator Francisco Franco, it oversaw a nationwide network of residential institutions managed by religious organisations. There's no definitive information about how many institutions were involved or how many girls were affected.Thursday will mark 50 years since Franco's death. Spain has since seen a revolution in women's rights - but survivors of the Patronato are still waiting for answers and are now demanding an inquiry.Family handoutAs a teenager, Mariona encountered people resisting the Spanish dictatorshipWarning: This article contains content that some readers might find distressingMariona, the oldest of nine siblings, describes her parents as right-wing and ultra-Catholic. They were so conservative they wouldn't even let Mariona wear trousers.But in 1968, when she turned 16, a new world unfolded.Mariona was tutoring children during the day, and preparing for university at evening classes. There, she says, she met people she'd never encountered before - trade unionists, left-wingers and anti-Franco activists. It was the year of global protests against authoritarianism and the Vietnam War, with mass demands for civil rights. The spirit of revolt was infectious.Franco had been in power for three decades. Political parties were banned, censorship was universal and young people wanted change. Soon, Mariona joined her new friends on \"raids\": a few of them would block off a street, throw Molotov cocktails, hand out leaflets, and when the police turned up, scatter in every direction.On May Day 1969, one of Mariona's friends was arrested at a demonstration in Barcelona. There was a risk the detainee would give names to the police - so Mariona couldn't go home, in case they came looking for her. That night she stayed in the flat of a fellow activist.Returning home the next day, Mariona was in deep trouble. Her parents were furious, and began to exert far more control over her life.\"For them, it was a scandal, a stain on the family,\" she says. \"After that, they wouldn't let me out.\"By the end of that summer, Mariona had resolved to leave home, and travelled to the holiday island of Menorca with some college friends, leaving her parents a note.They immediately reported her as an underage runaway to the authorities, and the moment Mariona was about to board a boat back to Barcelona, she was arrested.AlamyMariona's escape from Barcelona in 1969 was short-livedAt the port in Barcelona her parents met her.They didn't take her home. Instead, they took her to a convent. Mariona wasn't given any explanation - she only remembers her parents' rage.Days later she flew to Madrid with her father. There, she was driven directly to another convent, part of the Patronato system, under Spain's Ministry of Justice.She and the other interned women were categorised and segregated.Mariona says she ended up on the first floor - reserved for \"the rebellious ones - the ones they considered fallen women\".The Patronato had the power to detain any non-conforming woman under 25. They weren't criminals - they were females deemed in need of \"re-education\".  But Mariona never learned the stories of the others she was confined with.\"They didn't let us talk.  It's quite incredible,\" she says. \"And you wonder, how did they manage it?\"The internees were only allowed to exchange simple greetings with each other - a form of control, and a way of preventing \"bad\" girls influencing others.\"What you couldn't do was really get to know another girl,\"  says Mariona. \"Because then they'd separate you - send one of you to a different dormitory, or even to another institution.\"She thinks there were around 100 internees at the convent. They slept 20 to a room, with a nun at one end, and the door locked. The daily routine was gruelling - prayers, Mass, cleaning the convent, and then hours in a workshop making clothes for local retailers. While the girls sewed, a nun read aloud so that no-one talked.\"There was indoctrination,\" recalls Mariona. \"So that you should understand you'd behaved very badly. Then once you realised this, you'd ask for forgiveness and confess.\"Mariona never confessed.Marina FreixaIn her diary, Mariona wrote: \"Father says I must choose. Live a proper family life, or leave home forever.\"After around four months, she was allowed to return home to Barcelona for Christmas, but wasn't permitted to go out alone. Somehow - and Mariona doesn't remember how - she managed to escape, but her escape was short lived. Within hours she was bundled into a car with her father and an uncle, and driven back to Madrid.\"We arrived back at the convent at dusk,\" she recalls. \"I refused to go in. They pulled me up the stairs and gave me a sedative to get me inside.\"Inside the convent, the other young women were warned against talking to her - the rebel girl who had the nerve to try to run away. She grew intensely lonely, and eventually began refusing food.Dramatic weight loss resulted in her admission to a psychiatric clinic. There, she says she was given two sessions of electric shock treatment, followed by what was called \"insulin coma therapy\".Mariona says she was injected with insulin to induce deep hypoglycemia - a coma-like state caused by low blood sugar. It was believed this could reduce psychotic or schizophrenic symptoms, and somehow \"re-set\" a patient's brain. It was a \"therapy\" that was being discontinued in many countries for one simple reason: it could be lethal.Mariona received an insulin injection in the mornings. Later she'd be brought out of the coma and made to eat. Mentally, she began to shut down.\"Everyday, I was more dazed. I started saying things like, 'I hurt my parents,'\" she says.\"I entered this process of submission and acceptance.\"Mariona believes the forced, intravenous \"treatment\" with insulin irreparably damaged her memory. Suspecting it was causing her to forget things, she began keeping a diary. More than five decades later, this faded, paper document from 1971 would inform Marina's documentary about her mother's experience.Doctors believed the \"treatment\" would help Mariona gain weight - but that wasn't happening. \"One day, the psychiatrist decided it was better to try tying me to the bed until I ate.\"Mariona's despair became so unbearable, she says she thought about taking her own life. Then the psychiatrist gave her a target weight of 40kg (6st 4lb). If she achieved that, they promised she'd be released from the clinic.Mariona Roca TortWhen Mariona was released from the Patronato, she never returned to live with her parents againMariona succeeded. In 1972, once she'd grown a little stronger, she returned to Barcelona.Now aged 20, she vowed to never live with her parents again.These were the final years of Franco's dictatorship before his death in 1975. Mariona moved from job to job, eventually forging a career as a TV director. She had children of her own, but her relationship with her parents remained cool.At some point, Mariona asked her mother why she'd been sent to the Patronato. Her mother only said: \"We made a mistake.\"Mariona's father is in his 90s now. \"We suffered a lot too,\" he told her when she asked him about the family decision to have her locked up in Madrid.For Marina, learning more about her mother's story has complicated her relationship with her grandfather.\"I can't force myself to love someone who's caused so much pain - who treated my mother very badly.\"The short documentary Marina produced about her mother's experience of the Patronato is called Els Buits - Catalan for \"the spaces\" - a reference to the blanks in Mariona's memory. The film has won prizes in Spain, and was nominated for a prestigious Goya Award.Esperanza EscribanoMariona and Marina are touring with the documentary film, which Marina believes shows the institutions were a \"systematic\" part of Spain's historyFifty years after the death of Franco, the film has contributed to a groundswell of calls for the interned women to be formally recognised under the law as victims of Spain's dictatorship. Spain's Minister for Democratic Memory, Ángel Víctor Torres, said his government was open to looking at the case of the Patronato survivors.Meanwhile, Marina and Mariona are on tour with the film, taking it to community screenings.\"Women come and tell their stories – it's like a door opened to something unknown, and that's very powerful,\" says Marina. \"People think what happened in their own home was an isolated incident. We try to say: this history isn't individual, it was systematic.\"Her mother Mariona still doubts her memory sometimes.But, she says, \"seeing it all reflected in the film, that gives it the weight of truth.\"If you've been affected by issues involving suicide or feelings of despair, details of organisations offering advice and support for people in the UK are available from BBC Action Line.

    "body": "15 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporter, Belém, BrazilReutersMarching to the beat of pounding sound systems, thousands of climate protesters have been bringing their message to the gates of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Chanting and singing \"free the Amazon\", demonstrators in host city Belém have been carrying three giant coffins reading Oil, Coal and Gas flanked by two grim reapers.Indigenous groups displayed signs reading \"the answer is us\" as an inflatable elephant and anaconda weaved through the crowd under the hot sun.It is the first time since 2021 that protesters have been allowed to demonstrate outside the UN climate talks. The last three took place in countries that do not permit public protest.Prostesters played samba music and sang\"We are holding a funeral for fossil fuels,\" Tuga Cíntia told the BBC. She is from the theatre group Hydra Dance from the Federal University of Pará.\"I'm here because enough is enough with COP meetings and theory. It's time for us to actually act,\" she said.Indigenous communities, Brazilian youth groups, and activists from across the world joined the march in their thousands.As the midday sun intensified, some sought shelter in a petrol station forecourt.\"Fossil fuels are still being burned. We know all too well what it's like to live on the frontline of climate change,\" Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from Samoa, a low-lying island extremely vulnerable to climate change, told the BBC.\"We are here after so many COPS, marching for justice, for the end of fossil fuels,\" Ilan, from the non-governmental organisation 350, who lives in Brazil, said.Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from SamoaSome carried signs reading \"demarcation now\", calling for indigenous groups to be given legal ownership of their territories. Hundreds of indigenous groups live in the Amazon and are regarded by experts as the best protectors of biodiversity and forests.Smaller sister protests have taken place around the world including in the UK.Security was tight at the COP30 venue as police with riot shields guarded the entrance.On Tuesday protesters carrying signs broke through security lines at the summit. The incident caused minor injuries to two security staff and some limited damage to the venue.Representation of indigenous voices has been a flashpoint in these talks, some of whom have set up stalls outside the fenced-off COP30 venue to sell products to passing delegates. The meeting was dubbed the \"indigenous people's COP\" but many groups feel their concerns over deforestation, land protection and resource extraction in their homes are not being heard.Negotiations continued at the COP30 talks on Saturday. Nearly 200 countries are meeting to try to make progress on tackling climate change.Little progress was made in the first week of the talks, although some delegations say they are pushing for an agreed strategy to deliver on past promises to move away from using planet-warming fossil fuels.President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is hosting the talks and chose the city of Belém to put the world's focus on the Amazon.But shortly before the talks opened last week, his government granted permission to the Brazilian state oil company to explore for oil at the mouth of the Amazon.On Friday, analysis of attendee lists by the coalition Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) suggested a record number of delegates from fossil fuel companies are attending the meeting.A protester with sign reading \"the answer is us\"It suggests 1,600 lobbyists are in Belém, a 12% rise from the COP meeting last year.It is common for business leaders to come to the talks to strike deals. With the US strikingly absent from negotiations, progress has been slow. It is the first time the country has sent no delegation to the talks, after President Donald Trump branded climate change \"a con\".Earlier in the week a group of senior climate leaders wrote a letter calling on the summit to ensure the facts about climate change were \"upheld. Ten countries have signed an initiative called Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, launched by the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change.It aims to create international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote evidence-based information on climate issues.On the core issues of how to tackle the root cause of climate change and how to help countries adapt to ongoing global warming, Brazil has promised the talks will deliver action to implement years of deals and pledges. The talks continue into next week.",

    "body": "8 hours agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiFor millions across northern India, the November air tastes ashy, the sky looks visibly hazy and merely stepping outside feels like a challenge.For many, their morning routine starts with checking how bad the air is. But what they see depends entirely on which monitor they use. Government-backed apps like SAFAR and SAMEER top out at 500 - the upper limit of India's AQI (air quality index) scale, which converts complex data on various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, into a single number. But private and international trackers such as IQAir and open-source monitoring platform AQI routinely show far higher numbers, often shooting past 600 and even crossing 1,000 on some days.This contradiction leaves people asking the same question every year: Which numbers should they trust? And why doesn't India officially report air quality beyond 500?India's official air-quality scale shows readings above 200 pose clear breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Readings above 400 and up to 500 are classified as \"severe\" and affect healthy people while also seriously impacting those with existing diseases. The scale however does not go beyond 500 -  a cap set more than a decade ago when the National Air Quality Index was launched.So why was that threshold introduced?\"It was assumed that the health impact would be the same no matter how much higher it goes because we had already hit the worst,\" says Gufran Beig, founder director of SAFAR. He admits that the 500 cap was originally set to avoid creating panic as crossing that mark signalled an alarming situation requiring immediate mitigation.But this approach effectively flattens the data - anything above 500 is treated the same on official monitors, even if the real concentration is far higher.\"International organisations and portals don't impose such a cap,\" says Mr Beig. \"That's why we see numbers going much higher on global platforms.\"The BBC has reached out to India's pollution control board for a comment.Beyond the artificially imposed threshold, there's also a difference in defining hazardous air.For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines classify PM2.5 levels - particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers - above 15 micrograms per cubic metre in a 24-hour period as hazardous, while in India, the threshold is 60 micrograms.Experts say that globally, there's no universal AQI formula. US, China and the European Union each apply their own pollutant thresholds.\"WHO provides guidelines and every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment,\" says Mr Beig. Comparing India's AQI to WHO or US standards can thus be misleading. Then there is also a difference in the instruments used. The Indian pollution control board uses Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAMs), which physically measure the mass of particles in the air and are calibrated to strict, standardised metrics for every reading.In contrast, portals like IQAir rely on sensor-based monitors, says Abhijeet Pathak, a scientist who formerly worked for India's pollution control board.Sensor-based monitors use laser scattering and electrochemical methods to estimate the number of particles suspended in the air.\"The sensor is a different tool and it is not possible to calibrate them for every run,\"  says Mr Pathak, adding that \"sensor-based air quality monitoring has not yet been approved by the Indian government\".According to him, India's air quality framework hasn't been comprehensively revised since 2009, and he, along with other environmental scientists and activists have called for recalibrating the scale based on the latest technology.\"National Air Quality index will need to be revised if we want to include the sensor-based data,\" says Mr Pathak. Removing the upper cap is also crucial says Mr Beig, \"now that most literature available shows health symptoms keep on worsening as the pollution levels increase\". In the end, India's AQI doesn't stop at 500 because the pollution stops there. It stops at 500 because the system was built with a ceiling.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

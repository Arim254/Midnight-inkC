    "body": "8 hours agoMengchen Zhang, Jack Lau and Ankur ShahBBC Global China Unit and Eye InvestigationsBBCWarning: This report contains details of physical and sexual abuse and discussion of suicide.Baobao's heart still races when she smells soil after morning rain.It takes her back to early military drills behind locked gates - and the constant fear that marked every one of her days at Lizheng Quality Education School.For six months, aged 14, she barely left the red and white building in a remote Chinese village where instructors tried to \"fix\" young people whose families considered them rebellious or problematic.Students who failed to comply were beaten so severely they could not sleep on their backs or sit down for days, she says.\"Every single moment was agonising,\" says Baobao, now 19 and speaking under a pseudonym for fear of retribution.She says she considered suicide, and knows other students who attempted it.'Raped and beaten'A BBC Eye investigation has uncovered multiple allegations of physical abuse in the school and others in the same network, and cases of young people being abducted and taken to the institutions.Corporal punishment has been banned in China for decades, but we have collated testimony from 23 former students who say they were beaten or forced to do extreme amounts of exercise. One says she was raped, and two others, including Baobao, say they were sexually assaulted or harassed, all by instructors.Undercover filming has exposed how staff pose as authorities to forcibly transfer young people to their institutions.Thirteen students say they were abducted, with parental consent, by employees pretending to be police or officials.The accounts - from interviews by the BBC World Service, statements gathered by activists, police reports and state media - relate to five schools. These are part of a network of at least 10 schools, all of which have been run by - or have close links to - a military veteran called Li Zheng.Baobao says every single moment at the school was \"agonising\"The centres are part of a booming industry promising anxious parents that military-style discipline will resolve concerns over young people's disobedience, internet addiction, teenage dating and depression, as well as gender and sexual identity. Some parents even send over-18s, who are legally adults.A series of abuse allegations have made headlines in China in recent years, in both Li Zheng schools and others.In a few cases, arrests have been made or institutions shut down, but schools can be quick to reopen with different names or in different locations because the sector has been difficult to regulate. The BBC understands that Mr Li was arrested earlier this year, but we have discovered his associates have recently opened a new school.Companies and individuals involved in the network could either not be reached or declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in the UK told the BBC all educational institutions are required to comply with regulations.'Deeply offensive' body searchBaobao says her mother took her to the Lizheng Quality Education School in Hunan province when she began skipping classes, triggering rows which made their already difficult relationship worse.Her mother left while she was being shown around the school, she says, and she then realised she was not allowed to leave: \"They said if I behaved well, I might be able to get out.\"Baobao initially tried to kick and punch the instructors, she says, but decided to comply when they tried to restrain her with her own shoelaces. Later, she was searched. She describes the way this was done as sexual assault. \"I found it deeply offensive… she touched all my sensitive areas.\"She says her mother paid about 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months at the institution, and she was not given any academic lessons. Few disciplinary schools offer these, and some that do charge extra for them.The school is still operating, now known as Quality Education for Teenagers, with around 300 students, aged eight to 18.Undercover footage was filmed there earlier this year by a woman posing as a parent considering enrolling her fictional 15-year-old son. She said he was smoking, dating and driving her car.She was shown locked gates on staircases, metal grilles along open-air corridors and CCTV monitoring dormitories where children rest, get changed and shower.Filmed undercover, a staff member says Quality Education for Teenagers uses a \"white lie\" when it takes students to the schoolA staff member told her it would take at least six months to improve the teenager's behaviour, but under a \"three-year warranty\" she could send him back paying for just food and accommodation if he reverted to his old ways.She was told not to tell him about the new school. \"When we arrange pick-ups, we tell a white lie,\" the staff member said.She explained instructors impersonating officials from the \"internet regulator\" would say they needed him to help with an investigation, and take him to the centre. \"If this fails, several instructors will simply restrain him and carry him to the vehicle,\" she said.Another former student, Zhang Enxu, now aged 20, says she had a similar experience when she was taken to a different school in the network.Then 19, she had left home, frustrated with her parents' refusal to accept her transgender identity and her decision to live as a woman - she was registered male at birth. She says she had returned for a family visit to her grandmother's grave, when three men claiming to be police appeared, saying her details had been used in fraud.\"They forcibly dragged me into the car. My parents stood by as I was taken away,\" she says.Enxu says she was beaten and raped at the disciplinary school she was taken to at the age of 19She was taken to Shengbo Youth Psychological Growth Training School in Hunan where she says she was beaten, leaving her with hearing loss in one ear, and later raped.In the undercover footage from the school Baobao attended, a staff member says there are no beatings: \"We change the behaviour of youngsters with military training and counselling.\"But Baobao and Enxu describe a very different experience.\"Corporal punishment is ever-present,\" says Baobao. \"If your dance routines or military boxing lack precision, or are poorly executed, you will be punished.\"She said the instructors would use a pipe, raising it overhead before \"bringing it down with force\" on her classmates. \"Where they hit you would turn black. You get severe bruising.\"Videos obtained and verified by the BBC, that were filmed at another of Li Zheng's schools, show instructors raising a rod high and striking students' hands.Enxu says the students were forced to do \"enormous\" amounts of physical training. She said instructions to carry out exercises like push-ups \"might start at a thousand repetitions\".She also says she was attacked in her dormitory by an instructor on night duty: \"He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the floor, then he sexually assaulted me.\"Enxu's parents were sent videos of her at the school taking part in drills and counselling sessionsBaobao says she considered trying to kill herself, but realised she would be caught in the hours it would take her to die.She says one of her classmates did attempt to take her own life, but instead of taking her to hospital, the instructors tried to flush her stomach themselves.Both Baobao and Enxu describe counselling sessions where little understanding was shown.Enxu's sessions were videoed for her parents, who she says had paid 65,800 yuan ($9,300, £7,000) for six months. \"Be a happy, healthy, positive boy. All right?\" she is urged. \"You're a boy, do what boys do… just be happy.\"Baobao says that when she told the counsellor she wanted to end her life, the response was: \"If you were going to die, you wouldn't be sitting here in front of me.\"\"Is that something a caring person would say? Are they even human?\" she asks.Both students wondered how their parents could have decided to subject them to the experience.Enxu's mother wept as she told the BBC the family had been \"deceived\" by the school's promises: \"Not only did you swindle someone out of their money, but you also tore their family apart, causing a breakdown in their relationship.\"Footage obtained by the BBC that was filmed at one of Li Zheng's schools shows an instructor hitting a student on the handSocial pressure to have academically successful children plays a major role in parents' decisions - particularly among urban middle-class families - to send their children to disciplinary schools, says Dr Yichen Rao, an anthropologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.He has studied internet addiction centres for young people in China, and says lack of support in the school system, anxiety, and conflict within the family can combine to make parents \"feel that they have no other choices\".Baobao's mother declined to comment. Her daughter says she can now \"understand both sides\": \"I think she was brainwashed by the slogans used to sell the school. She was desperate for me to become more obedient… to be the daughter she always wanted.\"Baobao managed to leave after feigning an eye problem. Her mother simply said \"let's turn the page\", leaving her angry and confused, she recalls.Viral lettersEnxu's ordeal ended after a month. Her friends realised she was missing and contacted the police, who then located her and shared a video of her at the school. Her friend Wang Yuhang identified the school by asking in online groups about the green uniform she was wearing.Enxu discreetly documented her experience in letters that were smuggled out and posted online. They went viral and as public pressure grew, the police intervened and she was allowed to leave.Twelve days later, authorities announced Shengbo school was closing, but made no reference to the abuse Enxu alleged, saying, however, that the school had violated administrative regulations.She says the police later told her Li Zheng had been arrested, accused of involvement in organised crime. The police did not respond to BBC requests for information about Enxu's case and Mr Li. The local education department have also not responded.Secret filmingUndercover footage shows students doing military-style drills at a new school set up by former employees of Li Zheng schoolsMr Li keeps a relatively low public profile. The BBC has analysed his network and found it operates disciplinary schools across four provinces through a complex set of companies registered to him or his close associates.He founded his first centre in 2006 and has owned four different education companies at different times.The website of one of his organisations says he is a graduate of a Chinese Air Force academy in southern China, and worked as a \"director of training\" and \"senior psychological counsellor\" at several schools from 2007.On local television in Hunan province, he once spoke about nurturing young people with \"love and patience\".Chinese authorities have intervened before, following allegations about schools in the network.An instructor at a different Li Zheng school was detained by police in 2019 after allegations he had beaten students with water pipes.Also, according to Chinese media reports, the school Baobao attended was ordered to stop admissions after a student suicide in 2020. She was there at the time and says it continued to operate over that period. It changed its name soon afterwards.Mu Zhou, an Australia-based volunteer who has been helping document allegations of abuse, says \"whenever there's public outcry, he [Li Zheng] would alter the name or change the legal representative\". He also says students are bussed between different sites to avoid inspections.'Huge profits'Two undercover researchers recently visited what may be the latest addition to the Li Zheng network.Posing as investors in the Hong Kong education sector, the researchers set up a meeting with three former employees of Li Zheng schools, in a new school they have set up in Fujian.\"The profits in this industry are huge,\" Li Yunfeng, the director of counselling at the new school, told them. He outlined how the business model could work in Hong Kong, suggesting fees of at least $25,000 (£19,000) per student annually.He declined to disclose the name of their boss, but said he was \"a veteran\".He appeared to distance himself from the network, however, telling the undercover researchers: \"There were some incidents. The parents lodged a complaint. The group... though not formally dissolved yet, it's teetering on the brink of collapse. That's why I stepped out.\"Secret filmingLi Yunfeng told undercover researchers the previous group was \"on the brink of collapse\" but he is helping open a new schoolThe BBC was not able to reach Li Zheng, Li Yunfeng and other schools and companies linked to Li Zheng and his associates for comment, despite multiple attempts.The staff member who provided a tour of the Quality Education for Teenagers school declined to comment. The education department which oversees the school could not be reached, despite multiple attempts.Regulating these disciplinary centres is difficult. Some are not registered as schools. The responsibility is split between local education, civil affairs and market regulation authorities, a Chinese lawyer familiar with lawsuits against such institutions, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC.Dr Rao says that with no centralised regulation over the disciplinary schools, the responsibility tends to fall to local government.He describes it as a \"shadowy industry that the state just tolerates\", adding that the state may not wish to give it legitimacy by providing regulation or guidelines.But, he adds, there is a \"spectrum\" of schools, with some incorporating psychotherapy for students and training for parents, or disciplining staff who carry out corporal punishment.The Chinese embassy in London said the government \"attaches great importance to the lawful operation of educational institutions and the protection of minors\". It says all educational institutions \"are required to comply with relevant laws and regulations\".'Terribly sad'Enxu and her friend Wang want to see all disciplinary schools shut down. They work to gather video evidence of abuse and abduction, believing this is crucial to get the police to investigate, sometimes posting it online.Wang often receives requests from students. He has helped with the logistics of escape attempts and by pressuring schools to allow students to leave.Baobao never returned to education, which she says makes her feel \"terribly sad\". She now makes a living through online streaming and gaming, but believes she might have gone to university if she had not been sent to the Lizheng Quality Education School.\"These schools are essentially scams,\" she says.\"The prevailing educational ethos is one of violence begetting violence… the very concept is fundamentally flawed,\" she says, adding that they \"simply shouldn't exist\".Details of organisations offering information and support with mental health, distress or despair, or sexual abuse or violence, are available at BBC ActionLine.Additional reporting by Alex Mattholie and Shanshan Chen",

    "body": "18 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorThe government of Bulgarian Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov has resigned after protesters took to the streets in cities across the country and filled the centre of the capital Sofia on Wednesday night.Zhelyazkov's dramatic move came ahead of a vote of no confidence in parliament, and 20 days before Bulgaria joins the euro.Protesters had accused his minority centre-right government, in power since January, of widespread corruption. The government had already scrapped a controversial budget plan for next year in response to the demonstrations last week.\"We hear the voice of citizens protesting against the government,\" Zhelyazkov said in a TV address.\"Both young and old have raised their voices for [our resignation],\" he added. \"This civic energy must be supported and encouraged.\" A statement on the government website said ministers would continue in their roles until a new cabinet was elected.Between 50,000 and 100,000 people turned out in Sofia's central Triangle of Power and Independence Square on Wednesday evening calling for the government to go. The words \"Resignation\" and \"Mafia Out\" were projected onto the parliament building.They were backed last week by President Rumen Radev who had also called on the government to stand down.Zhelyazkov's government had already survived five votes of no confidence and was expected to get through a sixth on Thursday.Many of the protesters have been angered by the roles of two figures, oligarch Delyan Peevski and ex-prime minister Boyko Borissov, and Wednesday's rally was organised under the slogan \"Resignation! Peevski and Borissov Out of Power\",  Bulgaria's BTA news agency reported.Peevski has been sanctioned by the US and UK for alleged corruption and his party has helped prop up the government.Borissov is part of Zhelyazkov's Gerb party, which came first in October 2024 elections, and he was reported to have said on Wednesday that the coalition parties had agreed to remain in power until Bulgaria joined the eurozone on 1 January.Borissov was prime minister when anti-corruption protests brought down his government in 2020 and there have been seven elections since.Despite the political drama in Sofia, Bulgaria's move to join the euro is not seen as under threat.In his resignation statement, the outgoing prime minister said Bulgaria faced a major challenge and its citizens would need to produce \"authentic proposals\" on what the next government should look like.Bulgaria ranks among the highest in Europe in terms of the public's perception of official corruption, according to Transparency International.",

    "body": "8 hours agoPeter HoskinsBusiness reporterA former crypto entrepreneur who was behind two digital currencies that collapsed and lost an estimated $40bn (£29.9bn) has been sentenced by a New York judge to 15 years in prison for an \"epic\" fraud.Do Kwon, a South Korean national, was co-founder of Singapore-based Terraform Labs, which developed the TerraUSD and Luna digital coins.Kwon had admitted misleading investors about TerraUSD, a so-called stablecoin that was supposed to maintain its value against the US dollar.He was one of a number of crypto bosses to face charges in the US after digital tokens slumped in 2022, triggering the failure of several companies.US District Judge Paul A Engelmayer, who handed down the sentence, said the Stanford graduate had repeatedly lied to investors who trusted him with their money.\"This was a fraud on an epic, generational scale,\" he said during Thursday's court hearing in Manhattan. \"In the history of federal prosecutions, there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have.\"Kwon - who pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud - expressed remorse to the judge.\"I have spent almost every waking moment of the last few years thinking of what I could have done different and what I can do now to make things right,\" he said.Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD fell below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors that a computer algorithm had restored its value.Instead, Kwon had arranged for a trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the coin to artificially boost its value, according to court documents.",

    "body": "At least 34 people have died and dozens more are injured after air strikes from Myanmar's military hit a hospital in the country's west on Wednesday night, according to ground sources.The hospital is located in Mrauk-U town in Rakhine state, an area controlled by the Arakan Army - one of the strongest ethnic armies fighting the country's military regime.Thousands have died and millions have been displaced since the military seized power in a coup in 2021 and triggered a civil war.In recent months, the military has intensified air strikes to take back territory from ethnic armies. It has also deployed paragliders to drop bombs on its enemies.The Myanmar military has not commented on the strikes, which come as the country prepares to vote later this month in its first election since the coup.However, pro-military accounts on Telegram claim the strikes this week were not aimed at civilians.Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told the BBC that most of the casualties were patients at the hospital.\"This is the latest vicious attack by the terrorist military targeting civilian places,\" he said, adding that the military \"must take responsibility\" for bombing civilians.The Arakan Army health department said the strike, which occurred at around 21:00 (14:30 GMT), killed 10 patients on the spot and injured many others.Photos believed to be from the scene have been circulating on social media showing missing roofs across parts of the building complex, broken hospital beds and debris strewn across the ground.The junta has been locked in a years-long bloody conflict with ethnic militias, at one point losing control of more than half the country.But recent influx of technology and equipment from China and Russia seems to have helped it turn the tide. The junta has made significant gains through a campaign of airstrikes and heavy bombardment. Earlier this year, more than 20 people were killed after an army motorised paraglider dropped two bombs on a crowd protesting at a religious festival.Civil liberties have also shrunk dramatically under the junta. Tens of thousands of political dissidents have been arrested, rights groups estimate.Myanmar's junta has called for a general election on 28 December, touting it as a pathway to political stability. But critics say the election will be neither free nor fair, but will instead offer the junta a guise of legitimacy. Tom Andrews, the United Nations' human rights expert on Myanmar, has called it a \"sham election\".In recent weeks the junta has arrested civilians accused of disrupting the vote, including one man who authorities said had sent out anti-election messages on Facebook.The junta also said on Monday that it was looking for 10 activists involved in an anti-election protest.Ethnic armies and other opposition groups have pledged to boycott the polls.At least one election candidate in in central Myanmar's Magway Region was detained by an anti-junta group, the Associated Press reported.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPeter Hoskins,Business reporterandLily Jamali,North America technology correspondentUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at blocking states from enforcing their own artificial intelligence (AI) regulations.\"We want to have one central source of approval,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday.It will give the Trump administration tools to push back on the most \"onerous\" state rules, said White House AI adviser David Sacks. The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added.The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry.AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, with firms pouring billions of dollars into the technology.The BBC has contacted AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic for comment.But the announcement has been met with opposition. The state of California, which is the home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, already has its own AI regulations.California's Governor Gavin Newsom, who is a vocal critic of Trump, issued a strongly-worded statement in response to the executive order, accusing him of corruption.\"Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology.\"Earlier this year, Newsom signed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit risks stemming from their AI models.States including Colorado and New York have also passed laws regulating the development of the technology.Newsom has said the law sets a standard that US lawmakers could follow. Other critics of Trump's executive order argue that state laws are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level.\"Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,\" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement.",

    "body": "19 hours agoAdam EastonBBC News Warsaw correspondentPolish authorities have arrested a prominent Russian academic from St Petersburg's world-famous Hermitage Museum who is sought by Ukraine for allegedly conducting illegal excavations and partially destroying the ancient city of Myrmekion in Crimea.The suspect, identified under Polish law as Aleksandr B, is the head of the Ancient Archaeology of the Northern Black Sea region at the museum, according to Ukrainian prosecutors.Ukrainian prosecutors accuse him of conducting illegal excavations at the site in Kerch between February 2014 and November 2025.\"As a result of these excavations, from 2014-2019, he illegally partially destroyed the 'Ancient City of Myrmekion' archaeological complex,\" Prosecutor Piotr Skiba, a spokesman for the Warsaw District Prosecutor's Office told the BBC, citing information from Ukrainian prosecutors.Ukraine estimates the damage at UAH 201.6 million ($4.77 million).Russia invaded Crimea in February 2014 and annexed it. Russia's foreign ministry identified the man as Alexander Butyagin, an employee of the State Hermitage Museum and condemned his detention.\"This is absolute legal tyranny. We will of course demand through diplomatic channels the right to protect the interests of our citizen,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Myrmekion was an Ancient Greek colony founded by the Ionians in the first half of the Sixth Century BCE located in contemporary Crimea.Prosecutor Skiba said the man was detained in Poland on 4 December and was later questioned by prosecutors in Warsaw, \"where he refused to provide explanations\".The Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office issued an extradition request for Aleksandr B in November, Skiba said.According to the request: \"He searched for movable objects on cultural heritage sites without the appropriate permit to conduct excavations at the 'Ancient City of Myrmekion' archaeological complex in Kerch….and conducted illegal excavations at this cultural heritage site from the beginning of the temporary occupation of the territory of Crimea\".Russia's foreign ministry said Butyagin had been invited to deliver lectures on Pompeii in Warsaw and several other European cities.Warsaw District Court has agreed to remand Aleksandr B in custody at the Warsaw-Białołęka detention centre for 40 days until 13 January whilst the extradition process goes ahead.The Russian embassy in Warsaw has been informed of his arrest and pre-trial detention and are providing him with consular assistance, Prosecutor Skiba said.",

    "description": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been released from jail after a judge ruled the Trump administration had detained him \"without lawful authority\", his lawyer ",
    "body": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been released from jail after a judge ruled the Trump administration had detained him \"without lawful authority\", his lawyer says.A US court ruled that the government did not have a removal order for Mr Abrego Garcia, which blocks it from deporting him \"at this juncture\". Mr Abrego Garcia, who is married to an American citizen and has been living in Maryland for years, illegally came to the US from El Salvador when he was a teenager. He was mistakenly deported back to El Salvador in March and brought back to the US to face criminal charges.But Thursday's ruling may not be the final word as the justice department is expected to appeal.Mr Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, on Thursday that his client was officially out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.The order by US District Judge Paula Xinis means Mr Abrego Garcia can at least temporarily return to his family in Maryland.\"We remain hopeful that this marks a turning point for Mr Abrego Garcia, who has endured more than anyone should ever have to,\" Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg said.A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman criticised the ruling, calling it \"naked judicial activism by an Obama-appointed judge\".\"This order lacks any valid legal basis and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,\" Tricia McLaughlin wrote on X.The case became a focal point in the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration after Mr Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation.The administration has alleged Mr Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 criminal organisation, which he has denied. In 2019, he was arrested with three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities. At the time, the judge granted him protection from deportation on the grounds that he could face persecution by a gang in his home country.But the Trump administration deported him to El Salvador in March, prompting an order from the US Supreme Court in April requiring the government to bring him back.He was returned to the US in June, where he was arrested and taken to Tennessee to face human smuggling charges. He has pleaded not guilty.Mr Abrego Garcia was then released from jail in Tennessee, but taken into custody again after being summoned to a mandatory immigration meeting in Baltimore.Judge Xinis wrote on Thursday that he cannot be removed from the country.The judge had initially temporarily barred the government from removing him to a third country while she heard his challenge to the detention. In her order, Judge Xinis said the government had said it was considering removing him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and later Liberia. Costa Rica offered to take Mr Abrego Garcia, the judge said, but the government did not accept its offer.In her 31-page order, the judge wrote that immigration detention cannot be used for punishment or go on indefinitely. She said the first three African countries had never been \"viable options\", while Costa Rica \"had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there\".\"Whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the 'basic purpose' of timely third-country removal,\" she wrote.",

    "body": "Reddit has launched a challenge in Australia's highest court against the nation's landmark social media ban for children.The online forum is among 10 social media platforms which must bar Australians aged under 16 from having accounts, under a new law which began on Wednesday.The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms.Reddit is complying with the ban, but in its case will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights. It is the second such legal challenge, with two Australian teens also awaiting a High Court hearing.\"Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark,\" Reddit said in an update on its website.\"There are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth.\"Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats.\"We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she told parliament after news of the first legal challenge broke last month.In that case, which the High Court has agreed to consider at an as-yet undecided date next year, two 15-year-olds from New South Wales are claiming the social media ban is unconstitutional as it infringes \"the implied freedom of communication on governmental and political matters\".\"Democracy doesn't start at 16 as this law says it will,\" Macey Newland told the BBC after their case was filed.The ban, which has excited global leaders and worried tech companies, has also been criticised by some who argue blanket prohibition is neither practical nor wise.Experts fear kids are going to circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.But the policy is wildly popular with parents and has won the support of people like talk show host Oprah Winfrey, and Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.In a statement on their website, the pair lauded the \"bold\" action from Australia but said \"it shouldn't have come to this\".\"We hope this ban is only the start of a reckoning between society and the tech companies that built these platforms with growth as their first principle instead of safety.\"Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.Reddit said the law forces \"intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors\", isolates teens engaging in \"age-appropriate community experiences\" and creates an \"illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't\".\"There are more targeted, privacy-preserving measures to protect young people online without resorting to blanket bans.\"The case is not \"an attempt to avoid compliance\" or \"an effort to retain young users for business reasons\", it added.\"Unlike other platforms included under this law, the vast majority of Redditors are adults, we don't market or target advertising to children under 18,\" it said.The other platforms affected by the ban include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and  TikTok.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBrandon LivesayandMax Matza,Washington stateWatch: Record-setting floods hit the United States’ Pacific NorthwestResidents in the Pacific Northwest of the US and western Canada are bracing for potentially life-threatening floods as several days of heavy rain have swollen a number of rivers and tributaries. On Thursday, the National Water Center reported heavy flooding along the Skagit and Snohomish rivers in the state of Washington that is expected to continue through Friday. In Canada, major highways to Vancouver have been closed because of flooding, debris and the risk of avalanches.There are evacuation orders in place for thousands of people in the US and Canada, and authorities have warned more rain is on the way.In the US, the governor of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, declared a statewide emergency and estimated 100,000 residents could face evacuation orders.The emergency declaration warned that rain and possibly snow at mountain elevations would exacerbate flooding conditions. Governor Ferguson said there were no reports of fatalities, but warned residents the risk wasn't over yet. \"On the Skagit River, for example, the river will be cresting tomorrow mid-morning. Again, that is expected to be historic level on that river,\" he told CNN on Thursday evening.He warned it would take \"weeks\" to recover from the storm, and appealed for help from the federal government.An evacuation order was lifted in the Orting community south of Seattle, but Central Pierce Fire and Rescue cautioned residents to \"remain vigilant into the evening\". \"Remember, turn around don't drown,\" the department wrote on Thursday on X. More than 30 highways were closed across the state, with closures also affecting commuters in the Seattle area. The flooding has hit all of western Washington, as well as further south along the Oregon coast. Skagit County, a major agricultural area north of Seattle,  issued an immediate evacuation order to residents who live on the floodplain. Some 75,000 people would be evacuated from low-lying areas, officials said.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Thursday the Skagit river would cause \"severe near-record flooding from Rockport downstream through Sedro Woolley\".It warned of \"deep and swift flood waters\" especially in the Cape Horn, Hamilton and Thunderbird area. Rescues are taking place around the state, involving inflatable boats and helicopters. The Snohomish County Sheriff's Office said in an overnight social media post that they had rescued \"multiple\" people by helicopter after they got trapped in their homes in Sultan, Washington, about 40 miles (65km) north-east of Seattle. Officials said the Snohomish River was experiencing major flooding and \"dancing with records\" as water lapped against a local flood wall.King County - which contains the city of Seattle - and Snohomish County officials have warned the road closures could last for several days.ReutersEvacuation efforts were under way in Sultan, Washington, on WednesdayAcross the border in Canada's British Columbia, there are evacuation orders in place for the communities of Tulameen and Eastgate, and several other areas.City officials said the Nooksack River was expected to overflow its banks, and they anticipate flooding, though not as severe as in 2021, when it caused significant damage and five deaths in the province. Most major highways to the Lower Mainland are now closed, according to the travel-information website Drive BC.  The US-Canada Sumas Border Crossing is also closed to commercial traffic. The entire region, spanning parts of both the US and Canada, has received torrential rain from an atmospheric river - a phenomenon where water evaporates into the air and is carried by the wind and forms long currents that surge through the sky like rivers flow on land.Forecasters have warned of another storm on Sunday.

    "body": "15 hours agoHanna Temuari,BBC Africa, Addis AbabaandGirmay Gebru,BBC Tigrinya, MekelleEthiopian police have arrested a sixth popular TikTok creator days after five other influencers were detained over allegations of wearing \"indecent attire\" at a public event in the culturally conservative country.Adonay Berhane, 25, is a lifestyle and motivational creator with close to four million followers, who was named \"TikToker of the Year\" at the  Ethiopia Creative Award 2025 - the same ceremony now at the centre of the controversy. Police said on Wednesday evening that he was under investigation.The detentions have ignited widespread debate across Ethiopian social media.Supporters argue the arrests violate freedom of expression and stifle creativity, while conservative voices have defended the police, insisting that public figures must respect cultural norms.Among those arrested were Wongelawit Gebre Endrias, aka Evan, who posts lifestyle and fashion videos to TikTok. At the event she went braless under an oversized blazer jacket.Sporting a man-bag was Yohannes Mekonnen, known as Jahnny, a dancer and content reviewer who won an award for video production at the ceremony.Adonay was pictured wearing an open-necked shirt.Bereket Tsegaye, Mekdim Dereje and Girum Gezahegn were also detained.None of the six influencers have spoken about their treatment.But the mother of Adonay Berhane - Abeba Gebru - was shocked by the news.Adonay is her \"backbone\" and an \"example to Ethiopian youth\", she told BBC Tigrinya.Having spent his teenage years in Canada, Adonay returned to Ethiopia and much of his TikTok content warns of the negative sides of becoming an immigrant. He urges his followers to live and work in their homeland instead. Ethiopia's government has not commented on the matter, but police said the detainees were suspected of promoting behaviour that undermines public morality - citing concerns about the growing influence of online trends on Ethiopian youth.With more than eight million social media users nationwide, the incident highlights the growing strain between Ethiopia's rapidly expanding digital culture and longstanding traditional expectations.Federal police warn that further action will be taken against anyone \"violating the country's cultural values\" or promoting what they described as \"shallow culture\".",

    "body": "19 hours agoBethany BellVienna correspondent Austria has passed a law banning headscarves in schools for girls under the age of 14.The conservative-led coalition of three centrist parties, the ÖVP, the SPÖ and the Neos, says the law is a \"clear commitment to gender equality\", but critics say it will fuel anti-Muslim feeling in the country and could be unconstitutional.The measure will apply to girls in both public and private schools.In 2020, a similar headscarf ban for girls under 10 was struck down by the Constitutional Court, because it specifically targeted Muslims.The terms of the new law mean girls under 14 will be forbidden from wearing \"traditional Muslim\" head coverings such as hijabs or burkas.If a student violates the ban, they must have a series of discussions with school authorities and their legal guardians. If there are repeated violations, the child and youth welfare agency must be notified.As a last resort, families or guardians could be fined up to €800 (£700).Members of the government say this is about empowering young girls, arguing it is to protect them \"from oppression\".Speaking ahead of the vote, the parliamentary leader of the liberal Neos party, Yannick Shetty said it was \"not a measure against a religion. It is a measure to protect the freedom of girls in this country,\" and added that the ban would affect about 12,000 children.The opposition far-right Freedom Party of Austria, the FPÖ, which voted in favour of the ban, said it did not go far enough.It described the ban as \"a first step\", which should be widened to include all pupils and school staff.\"There needs to be a general ban on headscarves in schools; political Islam has no place here\", the FPÖ's spokesperson on families Ricarda Berger said.Sigrid Maurer from the opposition Greens called the new law \"clearly unconstitutional\".The official Islamic Community in Austria, the IGGÖ, said the ban violated fundamental rights and would split society.In a statement  on its website, it said  \"instead of empowering children, they will be stigmatised and marginalised.\"The IGGÖ said it would review \"the constitutionality of the law and take all necessary steps.\"\"The Constitutional Court already ruled unequivocally in 2020 that such a ban is unconstitutional, as it specifically targets a religious minority and violates the principle of equality,\" the IGGÖ said.The government says it has tried to avoid that.\"Will it pass muster with the Constitutional Court? I don't know. We have done our best,\" Shetty said.An awareness-raising trial period will start in February 2026, with the ban fully going into force next September - the beginning of the new school year.",

    "body": "9 hours agoMaia DaviesWatch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coastThe US has imposed fresh sanctions on six more ships said to be carrying Venezuelan oil, a day after seizing a tanker off the country's coast.Sanctions have also been placed on some of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's relatives and businesses associated with what Washington calls his illegitimate regime.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the seized vessel, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to an American port. Caracas has described it as an act of \"international piracy\".It marks a sharp escalation in the US pressure campaign against Maduro, which has seen dozens killed in strikes on boats alleged to have been carrying drugs from Venezuela. In recent months American warships have been moving into the region.The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of funnelling narcotics into the US. Venezuela - home to some of the world's largest proven oil reserves - has, in turn, accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources. Maduro vowed on Wednesday that Venezuela would never become an \"oil colony\".But the White House press secretary told reporters on Thursday that the US was committed to both \"stopping the flow of illegal drugs\" into the country and enforcing sanctions.Watch: US actions against Venezuelan tanker are 'criminal' and 'illegal', says MaduroShe would not be drawn on whether the US planned to seize more ships transporting Venezuelan oil.\"We're not going to stand by and watch sanctioned vessels sail the seas with black market oil, the proceeds of which will fuel narco-terrorism of rogue and illegitimate regimes around the world,\" Leavitt said. She added that the US planned to seize the oil on board the Skipper, after the necessary legal process.Leavitt also said Trump would not be concerned \"at all\" to hear Russian President Vladimir Putin had called Maduro earlier in the day to offer Moscow's support \"in the face of growing external pressure\".US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later said that imposing sanctions on three nephews of Maduro's wife, alongside a number of businesses and ships, would tackle the leader's \"dictatorial and brutal control\".In a post on X, he said the Trump administration was \"holding the regime and its circle of cronies and companies accountable for its continued crimes\".Watch: BBC speaks to Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina MachadoOn Wednesday, the White House released dramatic video footage of the raid that showed camouflaged soldiers dropping down on to the Skipper from a helicopter, and walking its deck, weapons drawn.The Venezuelan government strongly denounced the seizure, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.\"They have ushered in a new era,\" the Venezuelan president said in a speech on Thursday. \"The era of criminal naval piracy in the Caribbean.\"Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello called the US \"murderers, thieves, pirates\" and added that this was how the country had \"started wars all over the world\".The US treasury department sanctioned the Skipper vessel in 2022, CBS reported, for alleged involvement in oil smuggling that generated revenue for Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.The US had ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the days before the raid.It involved thousands of troops and USS Gerald Ford - the world's largest aircraft carrier - being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.",

    "body": "Dozens of flights and trains have been cancelled, schools closed and hospital operations postponed in cities across Portugal, as the two main union federations stage a general strike over unprecedented labour reforms.Public transport was down to a minimum service in many areas, and unions said refuse collections were at a standstill as the strike took hold on Thursday.The last time the CGTP and the generally less militant UGT joined forces was during the eurozone debt crisis in 2013, when a \"troika\" of international institutions demanded cuts in salaries and pensions as part of Portugal's bailout.Twelve years later, Portugal's economy has become the fastest growing in the eurozone in recent months, but Prime Minister Luís Montenegro says it is still necessary to tackle \"rigidities\" in the labour market \"so companies can be more profitable and workers have better salaries\" as a result.\"I will not give up on having a country with the ambition to be at the forefront, to be at the vanguard of Europe,\" he said on the eve of the strike.However, Montenegro appears to have been taken aback by the strength of feeling against his minority right-of-centre government's plans: one of his Social Democrat MPs is on the UGT executive and even he voted for a strike.The prime minister tweaked some proposals after calling the federation in for talks late last month, but it was clearly not enough.Among the most controversial of the more than 100 proposals are:letting employers roll over temporary contracts for years on endlifting a ban on sacking workers then immediately rehiring them indirectly via outsourcingremoving a requirement to reinstate employees who were unfairly dismissed.It is Portuguese in their 20s who are likely to be most affected by the changes - and opinion is rather mixed.Diogo Brito, who works as an air steward but has friends who do casual work in tourism, supports the right to strike but backs the package: \"It has to be done. We have to catch up with richer countries and with these measures I think we can evolve more.\"But self-employed photographer Eduardo Ferreira says he knows many people who already cannot find secure jobs and is pleased to see the unions unite at a \"critical moment\" for Portugal: \"Things have been tough ever since the troika, and workers haven't reacted until now.\"The CGTP has condemned the package as \"an assault on the rights of all workers, particularly women and young people\", while the UGT calls it \"so out of step, in a context of economic growth, financial stability and a strong labour market, that… it reflects a clear bias in favour of employers\".The UGT also complains that formal talks between unions, government and business were \"unbalanced, restrictive and detrimental to workers\".Montenegro's governing coalition lacks a majority in parliament, and is seeking support for the bill not only from the small, free-market Liberal Initiative (IL) but from hard-right Chega, which since May's general election has been the second-largest party. Its leader, André Ventura, has expressed reservations about the way some measures might affect family life, but looks open to negotiations.Before the election, Montenegro had ruled out deals with Chega, and the unions and the third-biggest party, the Socialists, say the prime minister's mask has slipped.They also warn that politicians on the right want to amend Portugal's 1976 constitution to loosen employment safeguards considered among Europe's strongest.The issue has also become caught up in the campaign for January's presidential election, with several candidates arguing that the labour reform bill flouts Portugal's 1976 constitution.Under Portugal's \"semi-presidential\" system, the head of state can decline to sign bills approved by parliament. Bills can instead be sent to the Constitutional Court for review or the president can exercise a veto that, while it can be overturned by a majority of elected MPs, delays the process, ensuring further discussion.With the government seeking to overhaul so much of the labour code, such scrutiny might stoke voter unease about its radicalism, particularly since the plans were not in the coalition's election manifesto.Unlike many strikes here, Thursday's day of action is not limited to the public sector. At Portugal's largest factory, VW-owned Autoeuropa, south of Lisbon, almost 1,000 employees voted unanimously last week to back it.\"I believe there is no worker in this country unaffected by the negative measures in this reform,\" said UGT secretary-general Mário Mourão, after the Autoeuropa gathering. \"It must be responded to appropriately.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoYang TianReutersNemo made history by becoming the first non-binary performer to win Eurovision in 2024The winner of last year's Eurovision Song Contest, Nemo, has said they are returning their trophy in protest over Israel's continued participation in the event.The 26-year-old Swiss singer said there was a \"clear conflict\" between Israel's involvement in the competition and the ideals of \"unity, inclusion and dignity\" the contest says it stands for.Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said Eurovision was \"saddened\" by the decision and respected Nemo's views.Israel's presence at Eurovision has been an increasing source of tension, because of the war in Gaza and a voting controversy during this year's event.Five countries - Iceland, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands - have announced they will boycott next year's event because Israel has been allowed to compete.Israel has previously called the decision to keep it in the contest a \"victory\" over critics who had tried to silence it and spread hatred.Nemo became the first non-binary performer to lift the Eurovision trophy with their song The Code, which is about the path to realising they were non-binary.After the win, Nemo told the BBC about the challenges they faced during the contest and their feeling that organisers had not done enough to support participants caught up in the row over Israel's inclusion in 2024.\"I felt very alone. I really hope they have things in place for the next year,\" Nemo said at the time. It prompted a series of new measures to be introduced to protect the mental well-being of Eurovision's artists and staff.In a statement posted to Instagram on Thursday, Nemo said they felt the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) decision to allow Israel to still take part in the event no longer aligned with its core values.\"Israel's continued participation, during what the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry has concluded to be a genocide, shows a clear conflict between those ideals and the decision made by the EBU,\" they said, referring to a report released in September.\"Even though I am immensely grateful for the community around this contest and everything this experience has taught me both as a person and artist, today I no longer feel this trophy belongs on my shelf.\"Nemo also posted a video of them placing the trophy in a cardboard box, saying it will be sent back to the EBU's headquarters in Geneva.In a statement sent to BBC News, Martin Green said: \"We're saddened that Nemo wishes to return their trophy which they deservedly won in 2024. \"We respect the deeply held views Nemo has expressed and they will always remain a valued part of the Eurovision family\"EPANemo performing at the 2024 Eurovision in Malmo, SwedenThe boycotts and protests over Israel's inclusion have been the biggest crisis Eurovision has ever seen.This year's competition also had a voting controversy and allegations that Israel's government tried to influence the public vote.This prompted some competition rules to be changed and tightened, after which a \"large majority\" of members agreed there was no need for a further vote on participation and that Eurovision 2026 could proceed as planned, the EBU has said.Israel's President Isaac Herzog has praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it an \"appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation\".Addressing the boycotts, Nemo insisted that their decision to hand back the trophy was not about \"individuals or artists\", but rather what they believed was the use of Eurovision to \"soften the image of a state accused of severe wrongdoing\".\"When entire countries withdraw, it should be clear that something is deeply wrong,\" they added.\"If the values we celebrate on stage aren't lived off stage then even the most beautiful songs become meaningless.\"The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,370 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Next year's Eurovision is due to take place in Vienna, for what is supposed to be a celebratory 70th anniversary edition of the contest.",

    "body": "The English section of South Korea's gruelling college entrance exam, or Suneung, is notoriously difficult, with some students comparing it to deciphering an ancient script, and others calling it \"insane\".So intense was the criticism around this year's test that the top official in charge of administering it resigned to take responsibility for the \"chaos\" it caused.\"We sincerely accept the criticism that the difficulty of questions... was inappropriate,\" said Suneung chief Oh Seung-geol, adding that the test \"fell short\" despite having gone through several rounds of editing.Among the most daunting questions are one on Immanuel Kant's philosophy of law and another involving gaming jargon.The latter, worth three points, asks students to pick where a sentence should fit in a given paragraph. Here's the sentence in bold, followed by the paragraph:The difference is that the action in the game world can only be explored through the virtual bodily space of the avatar.A video game has its own model of reality, internal to itself and separate from the player's external reality, the player's bodily space and the avatar's bodily space. (1) The avatar's bodily space, the potential actions of the avatar in the game world, is the only way in which the reality of the external reality of the game world can be perceived. (2) As in the real world, perception requires action. (3) Players extend their perceptual field into the game, encompassing the available actions of the avatar. (4) The feedback loop of perception and action that enables you to navigate the world around you is now one step removed: instead of perceiving primarily through interaction of your own body with the external world, you're perceiving the game world through interaction of the avatar. (5) The entire perceptual system has been extended into the game world.The correct answer is 3.Many have criticised the way the question and several others were worded. One user on Reddit called it \"fancy smart talking\" while another said it was \"awful writing [that] doesn't convey a concept or idea well\".Students are given 70 minutes to attempt 45 questions. Just over 3% of this year's test-takers scored the highest grade for the English section, compared to 6% last year.\"It took me a long time to figure out [several questions] and understanding the texts themselves was tricky... [Some] answers looked similar to each other. So I was unsure until the last minute,\" said Im Na-hye, a senior in Hanyeong High School.But English language professor Jung Chae-kwan says it is a misnomer to call the English test tough.\"The texts aren't necessarily impossible, but... maddeningly confusing. It's a pain because it makes the material useless for actual education, \" says Prof Jung, who previously worked at the institution that administers the Suneung, and now teaches at Incheon National University. \"Teachers end up drilling test-taking hacks rather than teaching English... You don't even really need to read the full text to get the points if you know the tricks,\" he said.Some pointed out that several passages used in the questions are excerpts from books that have been taken out of context, making them hard to comprehend. The above passage, for example, comes from Game Feel, a game design guide written by Steve Swink.Others, however, believe the difficulty of the test reflects its intended purpose.\"It measures students' reading comprehension and whether they can handle the level of material they'll encounter in university,\" says Kim Soo-yeon, an English literature professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.The passages chosen have \"some degree of specialisation\", which allows the test to assess such comprehension skills, she told The Korea Times.South Korea's Suneung, held every November, is an infamous eight-hour marathon of back-to-back exams that not only dictates whether people will be able to go to university, but can also affect their job prospects, income and future relationships.Students attempt about 200 questions across various subjects, which include Korean, maths, English, social and natural sciences, among others. Many teenagers spend all their lives preparing for these exams - some of them sent to private tuition centres known as \"cram schools\" from as young as four.The Suneung is a monumental event for the rest of South Korea too, as it brings much of the country to a standstill for a single day.Construction work halts, planes are grounded and military training gets suspended to facilitate an optimal testing environment.Only four of the 12 Suneung chiefs since the exam debuted in 1993 have served out their full three-year terms. While most stepped down because of errors in test questions, Mr Oh is the first to resign over a test's difficulty.Additional reporting by Hyojung Kim and Jake Kwon in Seoul",

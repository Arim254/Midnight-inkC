    "body": "7 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesMore airlines are banning the use and charging of power banks during flightsA man has caught fire at Melbourne international airport after a lithium power bank in his pocket ignited, leaving him with burns to his leg and fingers.The man, aged in his 50s, was in the Qantas business lounge on Thursday morning when the overheated power bank burst into flames, filling the exclusive area with smoke and prompting about 150 people to be evacuated.Staff quickly helped the man into a shower before paramedics arrived to treat his injuries. He was taken to hospital in a stable condition and later released.A witness said they saw \"battery acid flying everywhere,\" according to the Age newspaper. A Qantas spokesperson said the lounge was cleaned and re-opened two hours later.Australian film producer Leanne Tonkes was in the lounge on Thursday morning when she heard the commotion. She posted an image of the burnt power bank moments after it had exploded.\"Hoping the man who caught fire holding it is ok,\" she wrote on Instagram.\"Quick thinking from the man who jumped in to help and the staff who got him in the shower and everyone else out of the lounge.\"Qantas is currently reviewing its policy on passengers carrying any type of lithium batteries, including portable power banks, and is expected to provide an update shortly.Many airlines now advise passengers travelling with power banks to keep them within reach - either in their seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front of them - and not in the overhead luggage compartment.In July, a fire broke out on a Virgin Australia flight from Sydney to Hobart, with a power bank in an overhead locker to blame. The airline is looking to update its policy and customers are asked to keep portable power banks \"in sight and within easy reach\" during flights.A portable power bank was also likely the cause of a fire that engulfed and destroyed a passenger plane in South Korea in January. Several international airlines such as Emirates, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, Korean Air and Singapore Airlines have banned the use of power banks and the charging of them during flights.There are also limits on how many rechargeable batteries passengers can carry based on their capacity. For instance, some airlines only allow two power banks with a capacity between 100Wh and 160Wh. ",

    "body": "A British grandmother who spent 12 years on death row in Indonesia after being convicted of drug trafficking flew home on Friday, as part of a deal between the UK and Indonesian governments.Lindsay Sandiford, 69, was sentenced to death on the island of Bali in 2013, after she was found with nearly 5kg of cocaine worth £1.6m ($2.1m) when she arrived on a flight from Thailand in 2012.Indonesia has some of the world's most stringent drug laws, but it has freed several high-profile detainees, including the infamous \"Bali Nine\" drug ring, in the past year.Sandiford was repatriated along with another British national Shahab Shahabadi, who had been serving a life sentence for drug smuggling.Their flight left Bali at about 00:30 local time (16:30 GMT Thursday), Indonesian officials said. Sandiford and Shahabadi were both said to be suffering from health problems while in prison. Last month, Indonesia's senior law and human rights minister, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, said Sandiford was \"seriously ill\" while Shahabadi had \"various serious illnesses, including mental health issues\", AFP news agency reported.Sandiford attended a press conference in the Bali prison in a wheelchair hours before she was due to fly home.She had admitted to the offences in 2013, but said she only agreed to carry the cocaine after a drug syndicate threatened to kill her son.The UK's Deputy Ambassador to Indonesia Matthew Downing said Sandiford and Shahabadi were being repatriated on \"humanitarian grounds\". They will be given necessary treatment while being \"governed by the law and procedures of the UK\" upon their return, he added.In December 2024, Indonesia repatriated the five remaining members of the \"Bali Nine\" drug ring, after they served nearly 20 years in Indonesian prisons. The two ringleaders were executed by firing squad in 2015.Also in December, Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was repatriated to the Philippines. The mother of two, who was nearly executed, had always maintained she was tricked into carrying the drugs found on her.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNardine SaadLos AngelesShutterstockMeghan Markle and Prince Harry look on in the third inning between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers during Game 4 of the 2025 MLB World Series at Dodger Stadium. The Duke of Sussex has apologised to Canada for wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers hat while attending a World Series game against the Toronto Blue Jays.Prince Harry joked that he was \"under duress\" when he wore the bright blue cap during the epic Game 4 of the World Series in Los Angeles. He thought it was \"the polite thing to do\" after being invited to the game by the Dodgers' owner.His headgear choice upset many in Canada - a Commonwealth nation- who criticised him for not showing his allegiance to the realm, or to the only Canadian team in Major League Baseball. Prince Harry's father King Charles is the head of state of Canada and of 13 other Commonwealth realms. \"Firstly, I would like to apologise to Canada for wearing it,\" he said in a CTV interview. \"Secondly, I was under duress. There wasn't much choice.\"The prince - wearing a Blue Jays hat during the interview - quipped that \"when you're missing a lot of hair on top, and you're sitting under flood lights, you'll take any hat that's available\".He plans to wear a Blue Jays hat from now on and rooted for the Toronto team in subsequent games, appearing to do so in a clip posted on social media by the Duchess of Sussex - a Los Angeles native - when the Dodgers won the series in Game 7 a few days later.Prince Harry, who was given a Blue Jays hat while meeting with Canada's oldest veterans for a Remembrance event on Thursday, also said that admitting that he is a Toronto fan would likely make his  reception in California more difficult. Nathan Denette /The Canadian Press via APPrince Harry received a Toronto Blue Jays hat as he meets with some of Canada's oldest veterans, joining them in a creative arts program at Sunnybrook Hospital's veterans centre in Toronto on Thursday.The prince and his wife, a former actress who lived in Canada while filming her TV drama Suits, moved to California after stepping back as full-time royals in 2020.The couple's presence in the Chavez Ravine-set stadium in Los Angeles also disgruntled many Dodgers fans in the US. They took to social media to voice their upset over the couple's plum front-row seats during the 18-inning game, while local legends such as Magic Johnson and former pitcher Dodgers Sandy Koufax were seated behind them. Incidentally, Prince Harry published an essay this week about \"What it means to be British\" ahead of his visits with military veterans in Canada this week.In it, he said \"banter\" in pubs and sports grounds and a spirit of good-humoured \"self-deprecation\" are some of the things that he loves about Britain and what he thinks define British culture.",

    "body": "12 hours agoLily Jamali,in San Francisco and Aoife Walsh,in WashingtonNancy Pelosi has announced her retirement from Congress, ending a decades-long career that saw the California Democrat become one of the most powerful figures in US politics.In a video message on Thursday, Pelosi said she will not be seeking re-election to Congress at the end of her term in January 2027.It marks the end of a storied political career: Pelosi, 85, became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House and led her party in the lower chamber of Congress from 2003 until 2023.\"We have made history, we have made progress,\" Pelosi said in her message. \"We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"\"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" Pelosi added.Pelosi was first elected to Congress to represent San Francisco in 1987 aged 47, and quickly rose through the ranks. She was elected by her party to be speaker of the House in 2007, becoming the first woman to serve in that role. She served until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the lower chamber, before returning to the speaker's chair from 2019 to 2023.Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line to the presidency.In that role, Pelosi played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents during her long career on Capitol Hill.She is widely credited with marshalling the passage of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation, as well as bills to address infrastructure and climate change during Joe Biden's presidency.Pelosi also directly challenged Donald Trump throughout his presidency, famously ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address behind his back.By then she was also a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform.She led two impeachment efforts against Trump - the first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. Trump was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Biden, and of using military aid as leverage. He was later acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.The second was in 2021, when he was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. That effort ultimately failed and Trump was acquitted once again.On Thursday, when asked about Pelosi's retirement, Trump said she was \"an evil woman\".\"I'm glad she's retiring. I think she did the country a great service by retiring,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I think she was a tremendous liability for the country.\"After Trump's first term, Pelosi worked with Biden to shepherd much of his legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins.In less than two years, Democrats in the House pushed through a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage.She was succeeded as Democratic leader in the House by New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries in 2022.Since leaving her speakership, she has remained a major political influence. Most recently, she played a key role in helping to pass Proposition 50 in California -  a state redistricting effort aimed at flipping five House seats to Democrats during the midterms in 2026.",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton says he has sued Roblox over \"flagrantly ignoring\" safety laws and \"deceiving parents\" about the dangers the online video gaming platform poses to young people.In a social media post he said Roblox is a \"breeding ground for predators\", accusing Roblox of putting \"pixel paedophiles and corporate profit\" over the safety of Texas children.The lawsuit adds to the legal challenges related to online safety and internet predators faced by the gaming giant, which has tens of millions of daily active users.Roblox told the BBC it is \"disappointed\" that it is being sued based on \"misrepresentations and sensationalised claims\".The company's spokesperson said in a statement that it shares Paxton's commitment to keeping children safe online and that it has introduced measures to remove bad actors and protect its users.Roblox, which is especially popular with children, operates a massive online platform where users can play solo or with friends.The platform has been marketed to families and offers a host of educational games that teach subjects including coding, physics and problem-solving.Users are also offered developer tools to build their own games - a feature that has resulted in some violent and sexual content surfacing on Roblox.Another feature that allows users to enter servers and interact with strangers online has also been criticised for potentially exposing young players to dangerous individuals. Parents and children have raised concerns about Roblox, saying that they have seen distressing content or suffered abuse on the platform.Paxton called on the company to do more to protect children from \"sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen\".\"Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law,\" he said in a statement on X.Texas joins the US states of Kentucky and Louisiana which have also sued Roblox over potential harms to children.Dave Baszucki, Roblox's chief executive, previously told the BBC that parents who are uncomfortable with their children playing games on the platform should not let them use it.\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" Mr Baszucki said.Roblox has introduced features in recent years to tighten age verification and safety for young players.The platform said it is rolling out technology to estimate a player's age using video selfies and other measures before they are allowed to communicate on Roblox.Last year, Roblox also announced it will block under-13s from messaging others on the platform unless a parent or guardian grants permission.Roblox has been banned in some countries, including Turkey over concerns about child exploitation.The platform came under scrutiny in Singapore in 2023 after the government said that a self-radicalised teenager had joined ISIS-themed servers on Roblox.The 16-year-old, who was one of two young people who were detained at the time, had joined Roblox servers that replicated real-life conflict zones such as those in Syria, the Singapore government said.",

    "body": "6 hours agoMimi Swaby and James ChaterPeru's Congress has voted to declare Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum as persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision comes days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt. Betssy Chávez denies allegations that she played a role in ousted Peruvian President Pedro Castillo's plan to dissolve congress. She has taken refuge in the Mexican embassy in Lima.Mexico says it has offered Chávez asylum in accordance with international law, and rejected Peru's accusation that it was an \"unfriendly act\". The declaration - passed in a 63-33 vote in the Peruvian Congress - marks the latest escalation in worsening ties between the two Latin American nations. During the vote, Peruvian legislators also accused the Mexican leader of having close ties to drug trafficking - a claim they gave no evidence for.Chávez had been imprisoned in June 2023 over her alleged role in Castillo's plan to dissolve Peru's legislative body. She was released by a judge on bail in September and has denied the charges against her.Prosecutors are seeking a 25-year sentence for Chávez.Peruvian Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela told the Reuters news agency that legal experts were reviewing the 1954 Caracas Convention on diplomatic asylum, which Mexico used to justify their offer of asylum.Earlier this week, de Zela said Mexico had tried to \"portray the authors of the coup attempt as victims\".\"In reality, Peruvians live and want to continue living in democracy, as recognised by all countries in the world, with the sole and lonely exception of Mexico,\" he added.Peru also accused Mexico of \"repeated instances in which the current and former presidents of that country have interfered in Peru's internal affairs\".In 2022, Lima expelled Mexico's ambassador following its decision to grant asylum to Castillo's wife and children following his arrest.Last September, the Foreign Relations Committee of Peru's Congress proposed declaring Sheinbaum a persona non grata for failing to condemn Castillo's attempted coup and advocating for his release.",

    "body": "9 hours agoIan AikmanReutersThe UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US resolution to lift sanctions on Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa ahead of his White House visit next week.Sharaa was named transitional president after leading a rebel offensive that ousted Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending 13 years of civil war. Washington's ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz said the UN had sent a \"strong political signal\" that recognised Syria was in a \"new era\" since Assad was deposed.Sharaa was under UN sanctions as the leader of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was formerly linked to al-Qaeda. The US removed HTS from a list of foreign terror groups in July.The UN also removed sanctions on Syrian Interior Minister Anas Khattab.Syria's foreign minister welcomed the removal of the sanctions, posting on social media: \"Syria expresses its appreciation to the United States and to friendly nations for their support of Syria and its people.\"Sharaa's White House visit on Monday comes after US President Donald Trump said the Syrian leader had made \"good progress\" towards bringing peace to the war-torn country.The pair met for the first time in May, when Trump visited Riyadh on a tour of the Middle East.After that meeting, the US president described Sharaa as a \"tough guy\" with a \"very strong past\".His Islamist group HTS was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria until he severed ties in 2016.ReutersAfter the meeting, Trump said Sharaa had \"a real shot at pulling it together\"Monday's visit will not be Sharaa's first trip to the US this year. In September, he became the first Syrian leader to address the UN General Assembly in New York in almost 60 years.In his speech, he said Syria was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world\" and expressed solidarity with the people of Gaza.",

    "description": "A Ukrainian court has handed down the first jail sentence for life against a Russian soldier accused of killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war.Dmitry Kur",
    "body": "A Ukrainian court has handed down the first jail sentence for life against a Russian soldier accused of killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war.Dmitry Kurashov, 27, was found guilty of shooting dead Vitalii Hodniuk, a veteran 41-year-old Ukrainian soldier who had surrendered following capture in 2024.Ukraine's national police said that \"expert reports, witness testimony and video footage from the scene confirmed that the Russian soldier deliberately killed the POW on the orders of his commanders, who had instructed troops not to take Ukrainian soldiers captive\".In a months-long trial which began earlier this year, the court heard how Kurashov's unit stormed a Ukrainian position in the region of Zaporizhzhia on the morning of 6 January 2024.The prosecution said that although Hodniuk crawled out of a dugout unarmed and surrendered, Kurashov shot him point-blank with several aimed AK-47 shots – a violation of the laws of war.Kurashov and the rest of his unit were later overpowered by Ukrainian forces and taken as prisoners of war.Kurashov initially pleaded guilty but later retracted, saying he had only done so to expedite the trial in the hope that he would be released in a prisoner swap. He maintained it was a Russian medic – who later died – who fired the shots that killed Hodniuk.His version was refuted by other members of his own unit who were later captured by Ukrainian troops and were also being held as prisoners of war.They said they saw Hodniuk emerge from the foxhole unarmed with his hands up after Kurashov called for Ukrainians to come out of their foxholes and surrender.Although they did not witness the shooting because there were explosions at the same moment, all three said nobody but Kurashov had been around when they heard the gunshots. One said the medic accused by Kurashov was not present on the scene when the killing occurred.Kurashov himself never testified. According to court reporters, his lawyer Anna Karpenko said her client \"sincerely repented\" and that he believed he had simply been following orders from above not to take any prisoners.Nikita Manevsky, the prosecutor who pushed for the harshest sentence, had argued Kurashov had showed \"no remorse\" and \"nothing but indifference\" during the trial.Earlier this year, Kurashov told the BBC he had joined the Storm V assault unit in exchange for early release from a remote penal colony in Russia where he was serving a sentence for theft. Representatives from the Russian military told the convicts that if they joined the army and went to Ukraine their sentences would be expunged, Kurashov said.The recruitment of prisoners to fight in the war in Ukraine – which Russia calls a \"special military operation\" – is a known practice.Convicts who sign up are sent to join the generally poorly trained Storm V penal military units. Its troops are often employed to join \"meat grinder\" assaults on the front line – a tactic which sees waves of soldiers push forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery.In May the Ukrainian intelligence directorate (HUR) said it had recorded more than 150 cases of \"battlefield executions\" of POWs by Russian soldiers since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Last year the head of the War Department at the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office told the BBC that the killing of prisoners of war by Russian forces had \"clear signs of being part of a policy\" as they were happening across vast areas.Ukrainian forces have also been accused of killing Russian prisoners of war, but the number of such claims has been much smaller.",

    "body": "Small-town India to cricket World champions: The women who made history7 hours agoAnnesha GhoshSports WriterAlex Davidson-ICC/ICC via Getty ImagesAfter her father's death, Renuka Singh Thakur's mother worked to support her dreams Earlier this week, the Indian women's cricket team made history by winning its first World Cup title, nearly 50 years after the side played its first international match.The women fought hard for their win; after a three-match losing streak in the round-robin stage, they overcame external and internal challenges to defeat then un-beaten Australia in the semi-final and a resolute South African side in the final.The grit and determination they showed on the field are reflected in their lives off it.Many of the players come from India's small towns and have had humble beginnings. They come from families that had to sacrifice much to support their dreams and believed in them when no-one else did.These are women whose careers were built playing cricket in village lanes, with second-hand bats and seam-less balls and many doubting their ambition because of their gender. Theirs is a legacy that was forged because they kept going when it would have been easier to stop.Harmanpreet Kaur: Leading with what she came fromAfter the historic win was secured, captain Harmanpreet Kaur sprinted towards her father, Harmandar Singh Bhullar, the moment she saw him. She leapt onto him, wrapping her arms and legs around him as he held her. A captain - and a daughter- celebrated.Born on 8 March 1989 in Moga town - long known as the drug capital of the northern state of Punjab - Harmanpreet grew up in a family that kept its ambitions simple and its discipline firm. Her father, a club cricketer and clerk at the district court, sold milk from the family's four buffaloes to support the household. Cricket gear was often beyond reach. Her first coach Yadwinder Singh Sodhi once recalled how she trained with old bats and seam-less balls because that was what was available.Mr Bhullar ignored the neighbourhood refrain of \"ladki ko khilaake kya karoge?\" - what will you achieve by allowing your daughter to play cricket? He did not argue with the naysayers. He simply let his daughter - the eldest of three siblings - play.From those open grounds in Moga to the moment she lifted the World Cup trophy at Mumbai's DY Patil stadium, the values did not change for the Bhullars: work hard, stay grounded, keep going.PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty ImagesIndia's captain Harmanpreet Kaur (C) poses with family after winning the World CupAmanjot Kaur: Composed under pressurePace-bowling all rounder Amanjot Kaur's story begins in her father Bhupinder Singh's carpentry workshop in Punjab. When cricket gear was unaffordable, he made her first bat himself, carved from leftover wood.Neighbours questioned why he encouraged a girl to play. He continued working. She continued playing.In the World Cup final, her influence came in turning points. In the 10th over, with South Africa settling, she ran out the dangerous opening batter Tazmin Brits with a clean gather and throw. Later, with opposition captain Laura Wolvaardt past a hundred and the chase still alive, Kaur steadied herself under a swirling ball at deep midwicket. She juggled it twice and held on. The stadium erupted in cheers with that catch.The roots of that composure run deep. On her India debut in January 2023 in South Africa, she made an unbeaten 41 playing at number seven to lift India from 69 for 5. After that match, in a press conference - which I virtually attended with no other journalists present - she spoke quietly about her father's years of sacrifice. She did not embellish. She acknowledged what had made her cricket possible.Her catch in the final will be replayed. The hands that shaped her first bat are part of that moment too.Alex Davidson-ICC/ICC via Getty ImagesAmanjot Kaur's father, a carpenter, made her first bat himselfRadha Yadav: From pavement stall to podiumLeft-arm spin-bowling Radha Yadav's journey is measured in a few steps along one lane in Kandivali, a suburb in the western city of Mumbai. After earning her first BCCI contract at 19, six years ago, she bought her family a small grocery shop called the Radha Mini General Store. It stands only a few steps from the pavement stall where her father, Omprakash Yadav, sold milk and vegetables for years.The home above the shop measured about 225 sq ft (21 sq m). Space was limited; ambition was not. Her elder sister Sonee, who also played cricket, gave up the sport so that Radha could continue playing. The family backed one dream and stayed with it.She moved from tennis-ball cricket in narrow lanes to the highest stage of the sport because she was encouraged not to stop. The morning after India's World Cup win, a photograph went viral: Omprakash, smiling broadly, walking beside head coach Amol Muzumdar during the team's lap of honour at the stadium, the World Cup trophy held aloft, on his head.One frame held what the years had carried: street, store, family, belief.Annesha GhoshRadha Yadav's family, including her father Omprakash (first from right), outside the store she opened with her earningsRenuka Singh Thakur: Quiet controlFast bowler Renuka Singh Thakur lost her father Kehar Singh Thakur in 1999 when she was three years old. Her mother Sunita took up a government job to support the family. Her income was modest, but her support towards her daughter's dreams did not waver.Thakur first played cricket in the lanes of her village and later moved to the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association's residential academy in Dharamshala - one of the first residential facilities for women cricketers in the country. Distance from home and the demands of training were difficult. There were moments when continuing felt unsure. Coaches who worked with her reminded her of the sacrifices her mother had made to make playing cricket possible.That awareness kept her in the game.At this World Cup, she led India's new-ball attack, overcoming a prolonged injury-enforced layoff. In the final, she bowled eight overs for 28 runs. No release, no excess, no shift in discipline. A performance that shaped the match without seeking attention.A spell built on patience, restraint and memory.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "5 hours agoLily Jamali,North America Technology correspondent and Osmond Chia,Business reporterWatch: Tesla shareholders cheer Elon Musk's $1tn pay dealTesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders.The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares.The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name.\"What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" he said.\"Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\" he added.The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade to maximise his payout include raising Tesla's market value to $8.5tn from $1.4tn at time of writing.He would also need to get a million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operation.But his early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want Musk to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business.Watch: Elon Musk dances in sync with Tesla robots\"Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,\" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X.\"His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet.\"Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was \"almost comfortable\" allowing drivers to \"text and drive essentially.\" US regulators are investigating Tesla's self-driving feature after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries.Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months.Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring.Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks \"another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business.\"Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.ReutersElon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targetsIt is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added.Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over \"the polarisation of [Musk's] persona\" which has \"demolished the value of the brand\".\"Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,\" he said.Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him \"Tesla's biggest asset\" in a note published after the vote.\"We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,\" Mr Ives added.ReutersMusk said everyone would want an Optimus robotTesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon MuskMusk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did.But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk.Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision.The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors.Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursdays meeting.In recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts.A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk.",

    "body": "Typhoon barrels towards Cambodia after killing at least 193 in Philippines and Vietnam3 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Sen NguyenWatch: Typhoon Kalmaegi barrels through central VietnamTyphoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 188 people in the Philippines and five in Vietnam, according to the latest figures from the two countries.The storm is now headed west to Cambodia and Laos after it barrelled through central Vietnam on Thursday with winds of up to 149km/h (92mph).Towns along Vietnam's central coast were littered with debris this morning after taking the full brunt of the storm overnight. The strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. Thousands of people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings as the army was deployed to help deal with the damage. Vietnamese authorities have warned of possible flooding in low-lying areas. Central Vietnam has already seen record rainfall in the past week which has killed 50 people.Earlier this week the same storm devastated parts of the Philippines when heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods. The death toll reported on Friday was a jump from the 114 reported the previous day. Another 135 people are listed as missing. The Philippines government has declared a state of calamity across the country as it prepares for another typhoon which is building up in the Pacific Ocean.Ahead of Typhoon Kalmaegi, Vietnam's military on Thursday deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel for relief efforts, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and six aircraft. Some airports and expressways in the country were closed and hundreds of thousands were evacuated.Shortly after the typhoon made landfall at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT), hundreds of residents in Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported.Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.Many people said their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area.AFP via Getty ImagesTrees came down in high winds near Quy Nhon beach in Gia Lai, central Vietnam, as Kalmaegi approached on ThursdayAccording to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response.\"We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,\" he was quoted as saying.\"No one should be left hungry or cold.\" Before making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines.At least 188 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month's worth of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier.In Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction, Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home.\"We don't have any home anymore,\" she told the BBC. \"We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. \"We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different.\"Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.EPAWaves crashed on the beach in Cua Dai, Da Nang, central Vietnam, on Thursday",

    "body": "COP30: World leaders take aim at Trump for climate inaction13 hours agoEsme Stallard,Climate and science reporter, BBC News and Matt McGrath,Environment correspondent, BBC NewsPablo Porciuncula/AFPBrazilian President Lula warned of \"extremist forces\" when he addressed world leaders at the global climate summitUS President Donald Trump has been criticised by world leaders for his stance on climate change, ahead of the global COP30 summit.President Trump, who is not attending the meeting in the Amazonian city of Belém, was called a liar by the leaders of Colombia and Chile for his rejection of climate science.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the waning political support on climate change. He said it had been a unity issue internationally and in the UK but \"today sadly that consensus is gone\".Over the next two weeks countries will try and negotiate a new deal on climate change, with a particular focus on channelling more money to forest protection.Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit.And while Trump isn't attending this meeting in Belém, his views on climate change are certainly on the minds of many of the other leaders present.Speaking at the UN in September, the US president said that climate change was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\".He said: \"The entire globalist concept, asking successful industrialised nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies, must be rejected completely and totally.\"Without naming the US leader, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil warned on Thursday of \"extremist forces that fabricate fake news and are condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming\".The leaders of Chile and Colombia went further, calling the US president a liar, and asking other countries to ignore US efforts to move away from climate action.Maisa Rojas, Chile's environment minister, told the BBC: \"The science is very clear. It is very important not to falsify the truth.\"But while Trump-bashing went down well with the audience, getting agreement on new steps to tackle warming is proving much harder.Only a few dozen leaders have turned up here in Belém, and a majority of countries have failed to submit new plans to cut carbon emissions, the root cause of rising temperatures.AFP via Getty ImagesOuteiro Port in Belém was recently expanded to accommodate cruise ships acting as \"floating hotels\" for COP30 delegatesDespite Starmer acknowledging that global political support for the climate movement is waning, he told the gathering of those that were present: \"My message is that the UK is all-in.\"However, on Wednesday night, in a blow to the Brazilian hosts, the UK chose to opt out of its flagship $125bn (£95bn) fund to support the world's rainforests.President Lula hoped that $25bn could be raised for the Tropical Forests Forever Facility from public sources – mainly from developed countries like the UK – to support governments and communities protecting the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin.The protection of these ecosystems is crucial for tackling climate change - they cover just 6% of the world's land, yet store billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases and host half of the planet's species.The move by the UK has come as a surprise as it had been heavily involved in the fund's design, and launched a global commitment for countries to halt deforestation by 2030 when it hosted the COP summit in Glasgow in 2021.Lord Zach Goldsmith, who worked on the issue when he was environment minister, told the BBC's PM programme: \"The assumption was that the UK would be a leading participant and at the last minute the UK has walked away. It has caused real frustration to put it mildly here in Brazil... the Brazilian government behind the scenes is furious.\"The decision also seems at odds with the stance of the Prince of Wales. Also addressing leaders on Thursday he declared the fund \"a visionary step toward valuing nature's role in climate stability\" and shortlisted it for his £1m Earthshot Prize.COP26: World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030'Let us rise to this moment': Prince William and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer address COP30Prince William tried to encourage leaders to overcome their differences and move forward with action. \"I have long believed in the power of urgent optimism: the conviction that, even in the face of daunting challenges, we have the ingenuity and determination to make a difference, and to do so now,\" he said.And he urged them to take action for the sake of their children and grandchildren.\"Let us rise to this moment with the clarity that history demands of us. Let us be the generation that turned the tide - not for applause, but for the quiet gratitude of those yet to be born,\" he said.From Monday, countries will spend two weeks negotiating further action on climate change - with crucial questions on how to raise finance previously pledged for those already affected by the worst impacts of climate change.The last few weeks have seen devastating extreme weather globally. Hurricane Melissa, which hit the Caribbean last week, is one of the strongest the island nations have ever experienced - resulting in the deaths of more than 75 people. Recent analysis from Imperial College has suggested that climate change increased the extreme rainfall associated with the Category 5 hurricane by 16%.ReutersResearchers at Imperial College believe climate change increased the extreme rainfall associated with Hurricane Melissa, which caused at least 30 deaths and widespread flooding in Haiti (pictured)Additional reporting by Ione Wells and Justin Rowlatt",

    "body": "15 hours agoBarbara Plett UsherAfrica correspondentAnadolu via Getty ImagesThe paramilitary group, led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has taken the city of el-Fasher after an 18-month siegeSudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has agreed to a proposal from the US for a humanitarian ceasefire, the group said on Thursday.Sudan's military-led government has not yet responded. The RSF issued the statement after seizing the city of el-Fasher in the western Darfur region.Their 18-month siege blocked humanitarian aid despite repeated UN appeals, causing starvation among residents unable to flee. A UN-backed global hunger monitor has confirmed famine conditions in the city.The RSF has been facing an international backlash over reports of mass killings by its foot soldiers, which it has denied. But it has admitted \"violations\" were committed by individuals and arrested some.Civil war broke out between Sudan's army and the RSF in April 2023. Both parties have agreed to various ceasefire proposals during the war, though none have stuck.In September, the US along with the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a transition to civilian rule.The RSF's statement said it had agreed to enter the truce proposed by the four countries \"in order to address the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of the war\" and to allow the \"urgent delivery\" of aid.The group also said it looked forward to discussions about ending hostilities \"in a manner that addresses the root causes of the conflicts\" and \"creates the appropriate environment for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace\".On Tuesday, before the RSF's statement, Sudan's Defence Minister Hassan Kabroun thanked US President Donald Trump's administration for its \"efforts and proposals to achieve peace,\" in a speech broadcast on national television.But he added that preparations for the Sudanese people's battle against the RSF were ongoing. \"Our preparations for war are a legitimate national right,\" he said.Sudan's chargé d'affaires in Nairobi, Mohamed Osman Akasha, told the BBC on Wednesday that the military-led government would agree to stop the fighting only if the RSF was dismantled, surrendered its weapons, and its leader was held accountable.\"I have no information about a proposal for truce. The only thing that I know is the government of Sudan, the people of Sudan are very determined to defeat this militia,\" he said.The RSF's truce announcement comes after an aid organisation warned that a network of community kitchens in Sudan was on the verge of collapse.The locally run kitchens have operated in areas that are difficult for international humanitarian groups to access, but are facing closure due to neglect, shortages and volunteer exhaustion.A report from Islamic Relief quoted one volunteer as saying most of these kitchens - which are crucial lifelines for millions caught up in the civil war - will close within six months.The conflict has created what the UN has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with estimates that more than 24 million people are facing acute food shortages in Sudan.ReutersMany of those who fled the siege of el-Fasher are living in camps in TawilaMore than 60,000 people have fled el-Fasher, which was captured by the RSF at the end of last month, the UN refugee agency said.There were reports of systematic killings as the group's fighters took control of the city.Survivors who escaped the siege told the BBC they had encountered \"unimaginable\" suffering and witnessed fighters torturing men trying to flee.\"We saw people murdered in front of us. We saw people being beaten. It was really terrible,\" Ezzeldin Hassan Musa said.Last week, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo announced an investigation into what he called \"violations\" committed by his soldiers in el-Fasher.The group has since released footage which it says shows the arrest of a fighter accused of carrying out executions.The UN's Human Rights Council said it would hold an urgent session on the situation in el-Fasher on 14 November.More on Sudan's civil war:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

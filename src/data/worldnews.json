    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "8 hours agoStephen McDonell,China correspondent and Joel GuintoReutersZhang Shengmin heads anti-corruption efforts in the army and is seen as a trusted loyalist of President XiThe Chinese Communist Party has named a veteran who has overseen anti-corruption efforts in the military to be the country's second highest ranking general, just days after nine generals were expelled in a major purge.The appointment of Zhang Shengmin as second-ranked vice chairman of the Central Military Commission was announced at the end of a four-day Central Committee meeting.Zhang becomes the third highest official in the country's top military body, after the first-ranked vice chairman and President Xi Jinping.The nine expelled generals were suspected of serious financial crimes, China's defence ministry said last week. However, analysts said it could also be seen as a political purge.Their removal marked one of the Chinese Communist Party's largest public crackdowns on the military in decades.For months, the Central Military Commission has signalled that it would conduct a crackdown. In July, it issued new guidelines calling for the elimination of \"toxic influence\" in the military and listing out \"iron rules\" for cadres.The crackdown follows smaller-scale public purges of other military officials in recent years, including former defence ministers Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu.Following his promotion Zhang, 67, will serve with another more senior vice chair, Zhang Youxia, on the Central Military Commission.He is a general from the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force and has been serving as deputy secretary of the Central Military Commission's anti-corruption arm.He comes from the central province of Shaanxi and joined the army in 1978.Getty ImagesThe appointment comes after one of the Chinese Communist Party's largest public crackdowns on the military in decades.During the four-day meeting that ended Thursday, the party's Central Committee also approved a new five-year-plan – a broad document to guide its priorities.The plan emphasised \"scientific and technological self-reliance\", something Chinese tech companies will need if the Trump Administration continues to restrict access to computer chips and advanced software.The document also called for \"accelerating the green transition\" and \"modernising defence\" as well as boosting domestic consumption to make up for lost export revenue, during a time of geopolitical uncertainty.",

    "body": "At least 40 migrants, including children, have died after their boat sank off the coast of Tunisia, in one of the deadliest maritime disasters in the region this year, authorities say. The boat sank off the Mediterranean port of Mahdia in central Tunisia while carrying about 70 migrants, an official said. All the people on board were from sub-Saharan Africa, the official added, without providing further details.This is the latest disaster to hit migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean from Africa to Europe.Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, while nearly 2,000 lost their lives at sea.About 30 migrants were rescued in the latest disaster which occurred on Wednesday. Tunisian authorities have opened an investigation into the causes and circumstances surrounding the boat's sinking.The country is facing growing pressure to manage migrants fleeing conflict and poverty in search of better opportunities in Europe.The sea migration route between Africa and Europe is one of the most dangerous in the world. Last February, a boat sank off the Tunisian city of Sfax with more than 40 Sudanese people on board. In 2023, the European Union (EU) signed a deal with Tunisia to tackle irregular migration.The deal includes $118m (£90m) to stop smuggling, strengthen borders and return migrants.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterChangpeng Zhao, founder of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has been pardoned by US President Donald Trump.Zhao, also known as \"CZ\", was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 after pleading guilty to violating US money laundering laws.Binance was ordered to pay $4.3bn (£3.4bn) after a US investigation found it helped users bypass sanctions.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution under the Biden administration part of a \"war on cryptocurrency\".She claimed Zhao had been targeted \"despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victim\" and said prosecutors' efforts to seek a three-year prison sentence had \"severely damaged the United States' reputation\".\"The Biden Administration's war on crypto is over,\" she said.The move to pardon Zhao comes amid the Trump administration's adoption of a more friendly stance towards cryptocurrency than his predecessors.The President has vowed to make the US the \"crypto capital\" of the world and made his own mark in the digital currency landscape by releasing his own coin shortly ahead of his inauguration in January.Since then, he has sought to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve and pushed for making it easier for Americans to use retirement savings to invest in them.The Wall Street Journal previously reported representatives of the Trump family - which has its own crypto firm World Liberty Financial - had recently held talks with Binance.The company has spent nearly a year pursuing a pardon for its former boss, who completed his four month prison sentence in September 2024, the WSJ reported on Thursday.Binance has been approached for comment.The exchange, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, remains the world's most popular platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.Zhao stepped down from the company in November 2023. He wrote in a post on X it was \"not easy to let go emotionally\" but \"the right thing to do\". \"I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,\" he said.US officials at the time accused Binance and Zhao of \"wilful violations\" of its laws - saying they had threatened the US financial system and national security.\"Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,\" said then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\"Its wilful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.\"",

The president leads the National Democratic Congress (NDC) party, founded by Jerry Rawlings after he took power.Agyeman-Rawlings also had political ambitions - but lost out in her bid to become the NDC's presidential candidate in 2012.  Why Jerry Rawlings divided opinion in GhanaJerry Rawlings: Remembering Ghana's 'man of the people'As first lady, she founded the 31st December Women's Movement to empower women and teach them how to earn money to develop their communities. It was named after the date of her husband's second coup, which took place in 1981.Born in November 1948, Agyeman-Rawlings came from a middle-class family and grew up in the city of Cape Coast.She met her future husband when she became a boarder at the prestigious Achimota School in the capital, Accra.Unlike her husband, she went on to get a university education, studying art and textiles.Jerry Rawlings joined the air force and earned the rank of flight lieutenant in 1978 - a year after the couple were married.It was not long afterwards that Rawlings, aged 32, took power, with his wife said to be one of his most important advisers.Young, glamourous and charismatic, they proved a dynamic if controversial duo in the West African nation. Together they had four children and their eldest - Dr  Zanetor Agyeman-Rawlings - has gone into politics serving as an NDC MP.The former first lady's women's group, initially regarded as an arm of the NDC, is credited with significantly helping women across the country - especially in poorer areas.Her advocacy also influenced national policy and she played a key role in shaping a law in 1989 that guaranteed inheritance rights for women and children.She is also credited with contributing to provisions for gender equality in Ghana's 1992 constitution, which saw the return of multiparty politics.Ghana's parliament has adjourned to mark the former first lady's death as the country prepares to officially mourn one of its most iconic political figures and one who fought for the inclusion of women in politics.",

    "body": "The decades-old exemption that lets Trump fast-track White House rebuild5 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Bernd Debusmann JrGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump plans to knock down the entire \"existing structure\" of the White House East Wing to construct a new ballroom - despite previous assurances that the addition would \"not interfere with the current building\". The sight of demolitions has sparked an uproar from Democrats as well as conservation groups, including the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which wrote a letter calling on Trump to hold a public review process. As a former property developer, Trump has extensive experience of navigating planning restrictions, and has occasionally found himself on a collision course with campaigners objecting to his plans.Under a nearly-60-year-old law, the White House and several other notable buildings are exempt from a key historic preservation rule - though one expert told the BBC that presidents typically follow it anyway. Full story: Trump says 'existing structure' to be torn downWho is paying for Trump's new ballroom?Is Trump allowed to demolish part of the White House to build a ballroom?What does the law say?Trump's renovation appears to be the biggest in decades, but the president of the US does have the power to make those changes. And he is not the first to reconstruct the White House. Over the years, a host of presidents have made renovations, from a bowling alley to an indoor swimming pool. Under a law known as National Historic Preservation Act, federal agencies are required to examine the impact of any construction projects on historic properties. Specifically, Section 106 requires the agencies to undergo a review process, including getting input from the public. Then-President Lyndon B Johnson signed the law in 1966, after a period of rapid development in the US - including through federally-funded infrastructure projects - as concerns grew that cultural and historical landmarks were being destroyed. Why is the White House exempt? According to Section 107 of the act, three buildings and their grounds are exempt from the Section 106 review process: the White House, the US Capitol and the US Supreme Court building. In the past, however, typically presidents have voluntarily submitted their plans to the National Capital Planning Commission - which oversees federal building construction - before the construction project begins. Trump officials have not yet done so, but say they plan to, though the renovation has already begun. What's the precedent?Priya Jain, the chair of a heritage preservation committee at the Society of Architectural Historians, told the BBC that the process laid out by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was well established and would have been the \"best practice\" for Trump's East Wing renovation. These reviews - which can take years - involves discussions about programmatic requirements and potential alternatives.\"In this case, it would have been: do we need such a big ballroom? Should it be smaller?\" said Jain, a professor of architecture at Texas A&M University. \"Could it be an extension of the East Wing? Could it have been submerged?\"At stake, she said, is the \"history\" that the building contains. All the additions to the White House over time have added to how the public understands the building and the country at that point in time, she said. \"It's the memory,\" she said. \"The East Wing is 83 years old. It has assumed a historical importance of its own. I haven't seen much out there about how that was assessed.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia EditorSputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via Reuters and ReutersOne week ago I had the distinct feeling it was Groundhog Day, or as the Russians call it, Dyen Surka.Amid US threats to pressure Moscow - by supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine - Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump held a telephone call. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Budapest.Last August, amid threats of additional US sanctions against Russia, Putin met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Alaska.Déjà vu.But Groundhog Day seems to be over.The Alaska meeting went ahead, with minimal preparation and little result.But the Budapest summit is off. It barely had time to be \"on\", to be fair. Now President Trump has cancelled it.\"It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get,\" the US president told reporters.And that's not all.Previously, Trump had not followed through on threats of more pressure on Russia, preferring carrots to sticks in his dealings with the Kremlin.For the moment he has put his carrots away. Instead he's imposed sanctions on two major Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. That's unlikely to force a U-turn on the war from President Putin. But it's a sign of Trump's frustration with the Kremlin's unwillingness to make any compromise or concessions to end the fighting in Ukraine.Trump says Putin talks 'don't go anywhere' as he imposes new sanctionsWhat's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?The Russians don't take kindly to sticks.On Thursday, President Putin told reporters that the new US sanctions were an \"unfriendly act\" and an attempt to put pressure on Russia.\"But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decide anything under pressure.\"Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was less diplomatic.\"The USA is our enemy and their talkative 'peacemaker' has now fully set on the path to war with Russia,\" he wrote on social media. \"The decisions that have been taken are an act of war against Russia.\"Thursday morning's edition of the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets was slightly less dramatic, but obviously unflattering. The paper criticised \"the capriciousness and fickleness of [Russia's] main negotiating partner.\"So what's changed?Instead of rushing off to summit no. 2, as he had done for summit no.1, this time around President Trump was slightly more cautious. He had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lay the groundwork for the summit with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to make sure there was a point in decamping to Budapest.It soon became clear that there wasn't, and that a new summit now was unlikely to produce a breakthrough. Russia is fiercely opposed to Donald Trump's idea of freezing the current battle lines in Ukraine. The Kremlin is determined to take control, at the very least, of the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It has seized and occupied much of it. But President Volodymyr Zelensky is refusing to cede to Russia those parts of the Donbas that Ukraine still controls.ReutersMembers of Russia's National Guard patrol Red Square near St. Basil's Cathedral in central Moscow on 23 OctoberMoscow would have welcomed a second US-Russia summit. The first, in Alaska, was a diplomatic and political coup for the Kremlin. The red-carpet welcome in Anchorage for President Putin symbolised Russia's return to the international stage and the West's failure to isolate Moscow. Over the last week Russian state media have been savouring the idea of a summit with President Trump in Europe, but without the European Union at the table. Russian commentators portrayed the proposed meeting in Budapest as a slap in the face for Brussels.At the same time, few here seemed to believe that, even if it went ahead, the Budapest summit would produce the kind of result Moscow wanted. Some Russian newspapers have been calling for the Russian army to continue fighting.\"There isn't a single reason Moscow should agree to a ceasefire,\" declared Moskovsky Komsomolets yesterday.That doesn't mean the Kremlin doesn't want peace.It does. But only on its terms. And right now those are unacceptable to Kyiv and, it would appear, to Washington. Those terms involve more than just territory. Moscow is demanding that what it calls the \"root causes\" of the Ukraine war be addressed: an all-encompassing phrase with which Russia broaden its demands to include a halt to Nato enlargement eastwards. Moscow is also widely believed to retain the goal of forcing Ukraine back into Russia's orbit.Is Donald Trump ready to increase the pressure on Russia even more?Possibly.But it's also possible we may wake up one morning and find ourselves back in Groundhog Day.\"In the game of Trump tug-of-war, Russia is leading again,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets after the Budapest summit had been announced. \"In the couple of weeks before the meeting in Budapest, Trump will be pulled in the opposite direction by telephone calls and visits from Europe. Then Putin will pull him back to our side again.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East Correspondent, Jerusalem and David GrittenRubio: An Israeli annexation of West Bank would threaten peace dealUS Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have criticised a move by Israel's parliament towards annexation of the occupied West Bank.On Wednesday, far-right politicians in the Knesset took the symbolic step of giving preliminary approval to a bill applying Israeli law in the territory, which the Palestinians claim as part of a hoped-for independent state.At the end of a trip to Israel, Vance branded it a \"very stupid political stunt\". Rubio warned before flying to Israel that annexation would threaten President Donald Trump's plan to end the conflict in Gaza.Israel's prime minister called the move a \"deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord\".A statement from Benjamin Netanyahu's office stressed that his right-wing Likud party and its ultra-Orthodox coalition partners did not vote for the bill, \"except for one disgruntled Likud member who was recently fired from the chairmanship of a Knesset committee\".\"Without Likud support these bills are unlikely to go anywhere,\" it added.The prime minister's office put out the statement in English after Vance was asked about the vote by reporters before he boarded his plane at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport.\"If it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult,\" he said. \"The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel.\"\"That will continue to be our policy. If people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that. But we certainly weren't happy about it.\"Time magazine also published an interview with President Trump in which he insisted that annexation would not happen \"because I gave my word to the Arab countries.\"\"Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,\" he added.ReutersIsrael has built about 160 settlements across the occupied West BankIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice last year.Prime Minister Netanyahu has previously spoken in support of annexing West Bank land but has not advanced this due to the risk of alienating the US - Israel's most important ally - and Arab countries which have built relations with Israel after decades of enmity. Ultra-nationalists in Netanyahu's governing coalition have repeatedly called for Israel to annex the West Bank outright, though the bill was put forward by MPs outside the government.The bill passed in a 25-24 vote. It is unclear whether it has support to win a majority in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament), and there are ways the prime minister can delay or defeat it.The bill will now be discussed by the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee and would have to pass three more readings to become law.The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Knesset's move, saying Israel would have no sovereignty over Palestinian land.ReutersBefore leaving for Israel on Wednesday night, Rubio said annexation would be \"counterproductive\" for Trump's Gaza peace plan - reiterating US opposition to annexation.\"I think the president's made clear that's not something we'd be supportive of right now. And we think it's even threatening to the peace deal,\" he said.His visit on Thursday comes hot on the heels of trips by Vance and two US special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as the Trump administration attempts to push for the start of talks on the second critical phase of his 20-point Gaza peace plan.The first phase - which includes a ceasefire, the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces and an influx of aid - came into effect earlier this month.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaching the agreement over deadly incidents, but it has so far held.Rubio voiced similar optimism to that of Vance for preserving the ceasefire.\"Every day there'll be threats to it, but I actually think we're ahead of schedule in terms of bringing it together, and the fact that we made it through this weekend is a good sign,\" he said.The second phase of the peace plan would involve setting up an interim government in Gaza, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.The war in Gaza began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.In the ensuing conflict, more than 68,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.Additional reporting by Chris GrahamMore on this story",

    "body": "14 hours agoOlga Ivshina, Anastasia Platonova and Yaroslava Kiryukhina,BBC RussianHead of Belgorod region press officeFirefighters trying to put out a vehicle fire after a drone strike on Belgorod, RussiaResidents of Russia's Belgorod region say blackouts, air-raid sirens and the sound of gunfire aimed at incoming Ukrainian drones are becoming increasingly common, as Kyiv retaliates against repeated bombardments of its cities with cross-border strikes of its own.\"It's so loud and so terrifying,\" says Nina, a Belgorod resident who asked us to change her name.\"I was coming back from the clinic when a siren went off. As usual, I received Telegram alerts about a drone attack. Then bursts of automatic gunfire broke out, I ran into a nearby courtyard and tried to hide under an arch,\" she recalls.\"The next day it all happened again - air defence fire, automatic gunfire, explosions.\"The number of Ukrainian drone attacks on the Belgorod region has increased nearly fourfold since the start of 2025, according to BBC News Russian analysis based on data from local authorities.In September, more than 4,000 Ukrainian drones were recorded in the Belgorod region, compared with around 1,100 in January 2025. In one of the biggest strikes last month, the region was attacked with more than 260 drones, according to the governor. There has also been an increase in missile attacks since the summer.Ukraine continues to suffer far greater losses from Russia's near-daily missile and drone strikes, which routinely kill civilians and leave cities across the country without power and heat. At least seven people were killed, including two children, in Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight into Wednesday, and there are fears that the coming winter may be the harshest yet for Ukraine.DSNS UkraineSeveral people were killed on Wednesday in Russian strikes on Kyiv and the surrounding regionUkrainian authorities say the recent surge of attacks on Belgorod, some of which have caused huge blackouts, is a direct result of Russia's latest onslaught on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\"Maybe they should stop being too comfortable there in Belgorod?\" Zelensky said earlier this month. \"They must understand: if they want to leave us without power, then we will do the same\".Belgorod region is a key logistics corridor and staging hub for Russian forces near the border with Ukraine. It is also a regular point of origin for artillery and short-range drone strikes.Although there were local electricity outages in smaller towns in the region earlier in the war, the city of Belgorod was largely unaffected by power cuts until this autumn.Local student Ekaterina (not her real name) told the BBC she was at home in the city on the evening of 28 September, when notifications started appearing on her phone: \"Missile alert! Take shelter!\"The sound of howling sirens followed, and the lights in her flat started flickering.\"We ran to the corridor, because the explosions started almost immediately. They were very loud. The lights blinked and went out,\" Ekaterina recalls.Neighbourhoods of Belgorod lost power after a missile strike and power cut in OctoberMissiles had hit the main Belgorod heat and power plant and a substation, local Telegram channels reported.And while the city centre had its electricity back relatively quickly, some in the suburbs were left without power until morning. Across the region, around 77,000 people, or 5% of the population, still had no electricity the next day.\"While you're in the office in the centre, you wouldn't necessarily notice that there was a blackout. But when you're going home it's like entering a whole different world,\" another Belgorod resident Natalya (not her real name) tells the BBC. \"Complete darkness outside. Apartment blocks are without power, the shops are dark too. As you ride through the darkness, it's hard to tell where your stop is - you can't see anything\".Another big blackout came less than a week later.Authorities admit they do not have the capacity to provide everyone with back-up generators and have called on residents to buy their own.\"But what are we suppose to fuel them with, given the fuel crisis?\" Maria, an elderly resident who also asked to change her name, tells the BBC.More than half of Russia's regions, including Belgorod, have been affected by petrol and diesel shortages, due to increased Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries.Surge in Ukrainian attacks on oil refineries sparks Russian fuel shortages\"And the prices for generators have shot up as well,\" Maria says.Ukraine has increased production of its \"Darts\" drone - lightweight and cheap models that can carry a 4kg (9lb) warhead - and many Belgorod residents say this is the reason the strikes have become more frequent. The drones are effective both for single and mass launches which can potentially overload air defence systems.But the recent strikes on energy infrastructure that caused the blackouts in Belgorod are more likely to have involved heavier weapons. Reports say long-range Himars rockets or Morok drones with larger warheads might have been used.Head of Belgorod region press officeBelgorod has introduced mobile armed units to try to shoot down dronesAnd while for many in Russia the war still seems far away, residents of Belgorod region now feel its impact daily, like Ukrainians over the border.\"Until September, the war seemed to have faded into the background again. But now we are getting constant reminders - through power outages, fuel shortages, and a general sense of anxiety\", says Yakov, who declined to give his real name. \"I personally have a strong feeling that, by continuing the war, Russia is racing headlong toward the abyss\".Additional reporting by Ilya Abishev",

    "body": "9 hours agoTom McArthurMusees de LangresThe treasure on display at Maison des Lumières is part of the city's private collectionAround 2,000 gold and silver coins worth around €90,000 (£78,000; $104,000) were stolen during a raid at another French museum - just hours after the audacious theft of some of the French crown jewels at the Louvre in Paris.The incident happened at a museum dedicated to French philosopher Denis Diderot in Landres, north-eastern France on Sunday night.When the Maison des Lumières (House of Enlightenment) opened on Tuesday, workers noticed a smashed display case and raised the alarm, officials said. The coins were selected with \"great expertise\", a statement to French media from the local authority said.It is the latest in a recent string of heists at cultural institutions across France.No camera covered Louvre wall where jewel thieves broke inHow Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftThe stolen coins date from between 1790 and 1840 and are part of the city's private collection, after being discovered in 2011 during renovation work at the building that now houses the museum, according to local media.Also in September, thieves stole two Chinese porcelain dishes and a vase with an estimated combined worth of €6.55m from the national porcelain museum in the central city of Limoges. The items are still missing and no arrests have been made.\"They're unsaleable on the art market. The pieces are too easily traceable anyway because they're so well listed,\" a ceramics expert told Le Parisien newspaper at the time.The heist that has made headlines across the globe was the brazen daylight robbery of €88m worth of historic jewellery from the Louvre museum in Paris.A gang disguised as workers used power-tools and a mechanical ladder to gain access to the first-floor Gallery of Apollo in the world's most visited museum shortly after it opened on Sunday.The loot included a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife, a tiara worn by Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, and several pieces previously owned by Queen Marie-Amelie.Can France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Art detective Arthur Brand told the BBC museums across Europe could see a flurry of copycat raids in the coming months.If someone can target the Louvre and escape with the French crown jewels, local thieves may think \"let's try our nearest museum\", he said.Security is clearly a problem for many cultural institutions, he said, before adding that compared to a heavily protected jewellery store, a museum with lax security and unarmed guards is a ripe target for robbers.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe Louvre heist - as well as the other incidents - have raised concerns in France around the lax security at institutions that house some of its most prized treasures.Speaking publicly for the first time since the heist, the Louvre's director Laurence des Cars told French senators on Wednesday that CCTV around the Louvre's perimeter was weak and \"aging\".The only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where the theives broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to the gallery housing the jewels, she said.\"We failed these jewels,\" des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".A preliminary report found one in three rooms in the Louvre lacked CCTV and that its wider alarm system did not go off.Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said security protocols had \"failed\", lamenting that the thieves being able to drive a modified truck up to the museum had left France with a \"terrible image\".In the case of the gold stolen from the French Natural History Museum, the building's alarm and surveillance systems had been disabled by a cyber-attack, with the thieves apparently aware of this, French media reported at the time.",

    "body": "New images show Israeli control line deeper into Gaza than expected7 hours agoBenedict Garman, Emma Pengelly and Matt Murphy,BBC VerifyBBCThe Israeli military is exerting control over more of Gaza than expected from the ceasefire deal with Hamas, a BBC Verify analysis has found.Under the first stage of the deal, Israel agreed to retreat to a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. The divide was marked by a yellow line on maps released by the military and has become known as the \"Yellow Line\".But new videos and satellite images show that markers placed by Israeli troops in two areas to mark the divide have been positioned hundreds of metres deeper inside the strip than the expected withdrawal line.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz - who instructed troops to place the yellow blocks as markers - warned that anyone crossing the line \"will be met with fire\". There have already been at least two deadly incidents near the boundary line.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not address the allegations when approached by BBC Verify, stating simply that: \"IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground.\"There has been a consistent lack of clarity as to where exactly the boundary will be imposed, with three separate maps posted by the White House, Donald Trump and the Israeli military in the run up to the ceasefire agreement which came into force on 10 October. On 14 October the IDF issued the latest version marking the Yellow Line on their online map, which is used to communicate its position to people in Gaza.But in the north, near the al-Atatra neighbourhood, drone footage from the IDF showed that a line of six yellow blocks were up to 520m further inside the Strip than would have been expected from the IDF maps.Footage geolocated by BBC Verify showed workers using bulldozers and diggers to move the heavy yellow blocks and place them along the coastal al-Rashid road.A similar situation was visible in southern Gaza, where a satellite image taken on 19 October showed 10 markers erected near the city of Khan Younis. The line of blocks ranges between 180m-290m inside the Yellow Line set out by the IDF.If these two sections of boundary were typical of how the markers were being placed along the entirety of the line then Israel would be exerting control over a notably larger area than expected from the ceasefire agreement.Multiple analysts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the blocks were intended to create a \"buffer zone\" between Palestinians and IDF personnel. One expert said the move would be consistent with a long-term \"strategic culture\" which seeks to insulate Israel from nearby territories it does not fully control.\"This gives the IDF space to manoeuvre and create a 'kill zone' against potential targets,\" Dr Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London, said.\"Potential targets can be engaged before they reach the IDF perimeter. It is a bit like no man's land that does not belong to anyone – and Israel tends to take that territory from the opponent's chunk not its own.\"Three experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disparity between the markers and the IDF map was an intentional design to warn civilians they are \"approaching an area of increased risk\".Noam Ostfeld, an analyst with the risk consultancy Sibylline, said that some blocks \"seem to be positioned near roads or walls, making them easier to spot\".But a post to X by the Israeli defense minister seemed to suggest that the yellow blocks marked the actual line, warning that \"any violation or attempt to cross the line will be met with fire\".There is already confusion among Gazans over areas where it is safe to go.Abdel Qader Ayman Bakr, who lives near the temporary boundary in the eastern part of Gaza City's Shejaiya district, told the BBC that, despite promises from Israel of clear markings, he had seen none put in place.\"Each day, we can see Israeli military vehicles and soldiers at a relatively close distance, yet we have no way of knowing whether we are in what is considered a 'safe zone' or 'an active danger zone',\" he said.\"We are constantly exposed to danger, especially since we are forced to remain here because this is where our home once stood.\"Since the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF has reported a number of instances of people crossing the Yellow Line. On all occasions the IDF said it fired upon those involved.BBC Verify has obtained and geolocated footage showing the aftermath of one incident on 17 October, which the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said killed 11 civilians - including women and children all reportedly from the same family. The agency said the Palestinians' vehicle was targeted by Israel after crossing the Yellow Line east of Gaza City in the Zeitoun neighbourhood.The footage showed rescue workers inspecting the burnt out remnants of a vehicle and covering a nearby badly-mangled body of a child with a white sheet. BBC Verify geolocated the video to a spot around 125m over the Yellow Line marked on maps by the IDF.The IDF said warning shots were fired towards a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the line. The statement added when the vehicle failed to stop troops opened fire \"to remove the threat\".Israel Defense Forces (IDF)Meanwhile, the legal status of the boundary has also been questioned.\"Israel's obligations under the law of armed conflict do not cease even for those breaching the Yellow Line,\" said Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, professor of Public International Law at the University of Bristol.\"It can only target enemy fighters or those directly participating in hostilities, and in so doing it must not cause excessive civilian harm.\"In a statement, an Israeli military spokesperson said: \"IDF troops under the Southern Command continue to operate to remove any threat to the troops and to defend the civilians of the State of Israel.\"They added that the concrete blocks are \"being placed every 200 metres\".Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.At least 68,280 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Additional reporting by Erwan Rivault, Lamees Altalebi and Maha El Gaml",

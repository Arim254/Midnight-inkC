    "body": "11 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterSinger Julio Iglesias has denied allegations of sexual assault made by two female former employees.The women allege that the 82-year-old Spanish superstar \"normalised abuse\" in a coercive, threatening and violent environment while they were working at his properties in the Bahamas and Dominican Republic.Responding on Instagram, Iglesias said: \"I deny having abused, coerced, or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and deeply sadden me.\"The allegations, which were first reported earlier this week, are being investigated by Spain's judiciary.The two women - a domestic worker and a physiotherapist - have alleged they suffered sexual and other forms of abuse while working at Iglesias's properties.The reports said they worked in his Caribbean residences for 10 months in 2021, which is when they allege the sexual assaults took place.On 5 January, the women filed a legal complaint for sexual assault and human trafficking with the national court, which investigates crimes allegedly committed beyond Spain's borders.Advocacy groups Women's Link Worldwide and Amnesty International said the acts alleged in the complaint could be considered \"a crime of human trafficking for the purpose of forced labour\" and \"crimes against sexual freedom\".According to testimony collected by the two groups, Iglesias subjected the women to \"sexual harassment, regularly checked their mobile phones, restricted their ability to leave the home where they worked, and required them to work up to 16 hours a day without days off\".Women's Link described the complainants as young Latin American women \"in vulnerable situations who were heavily dependent on their wages due to their economic and social conditions\".In his Instagram statement, Iglesias wrote: \"It is with profound sadness that I respond to the accusations made by two people who previously worked for me.He added: \"I have never felt such malice, but I still have the strength to let people know the whole truth and defend my dignity against such a serious accusation.\"The singer also thanked the \"so many dear people who have sent me messages of affection and loyalty\", adding: \"I have found great comfort in them.\"According to by Spanish news site elDiario.es and US outlet Univision, which investigated the claims over three years, the women's allegations are backed up by documentary evidence including photographs, phone records, text messages and medical reports.Their reports cite other former employees who describe a threatening, highly stressful atmosphere for those working for Iglesias.But an old friend of the singer, Jaime Peñafiel, labelled the accusations \"absolute lies\", while another ally, journalist Miguel Ángel Pastor, said he had never heard \"any suggestion that he might have committed this kind of act\".Iglesias is one of the most successful Latin artists of all time, having sold more than 300 million records in a career spanning decades.He is also the father of fellow music superstar Enrique Iglesias.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMaia DaviesBBC NewsWatch: What Machado and Trump have said about Nobel Peace Prize medal exchangeVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country \"when the right time comes\".\"There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president,\" she told Fox News.Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom.The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges. EPA/ShutterstockMachado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday However, Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president and who on Friday held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA \"at President Trump's direction\" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official.\"Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries,\" the US official said.Asked on Friday about his decision to work with Rodríguez over Machado, Trump told reporters his decision had been informed by the US experience in Iraq more than 20 years ago. Security and political structures were dismantled after the US invaded, setting the scene for insurgency and the eventual emergence of the Islamic State group.\"If you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired - every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired - and they ended up being ISIS... I remember that,\" he said.Speaking later at an event in Washington, Machado said she was confident there would be an \"orderly transition\" in her country.\"The result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela that will be the best ally the US has ever had in the Americas,\" she said.\"This has nothing to do with a tension between Delcy Rodríguez and myself, this is about a criminal structure - that is the regime - and the Venezuelan people,\" she added, describing herself as \"just one member of a movement of millions of Venezuelans\".Meanwhile, in Venezuela's capital Caracas, Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president.She said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically, through political dialogue\".Rodríguez also said Venezuela needed to defend its \"dignity and honour\", and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment in a step away from Maduro's policies.Trump called Rodríguez a \"terrific person\" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called \"productive and courteous\".The following day, the US president called Machado a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much\", describing her gift of the Nobel Peace Prize medal as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect\".Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal on Thursday",

    "body": "8 hours agoLucy WilliamsonBashmaq border crossing, Iraqi KurdistanFred Scott/BBCPeople and traffic still regularly cross the Iran-Iraq borderAt the border crossing from Iran into Iraqi Kurdistan, the stern face of Iran's former supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, peers down at the trickle of Iranians leaving the territory.Thick snowflakes confetti the lorries and pedestrians arriving at this remote mountain pass.Metres away, just beyond the border post, an Iranian flag flutters in the snow.Iran has shut down the internet and blocked phone calls into the country, but its borders are still open.Inside the arrivals hall, we find dozens of men, women and children – many arriving to visit family on the Iraqi side of the border. No-one we met said they were fleeing Iran because of the recent protests and government crackdown, but one man – who asked us to hide his identity – told us security forces had shot him during a protest in central Iran last Friday.\"I was hit in the face by seven pellet rounds,\" he said, pointing out several weals and bruises on his face. \"They struck above my eyelid, on my forehead, my cheek, my lip, under my ear and along my jaw. I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.\"He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them.\"One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,\" he told us.  \"His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone.  They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.\"Iran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat.  Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.But several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere.\"Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,\" he said.  \"My friends were there.  We were constantly on the phone.  On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then.\"Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth.Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street.  It's not clear what form of protest that was, or how many were taking part.The BBC has seen no hard evidence that street protests are still continuing. Very little footage at all is trickling out, and the reports we heard today are impossible to confirm. The BBC, along with other international media, is barred from reporting inside Iran.Fred Scott/BBCThe Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout more than a week agoThe government's repression largely seems to be working. But the economic problems that sparked this crisis haven't gone away.A teacher from a town close to the border told us she didn't care who the leader was, she just wanted the economic situation to improve.\"We don't want anything more than our basic rights,\" she told me. \"To own a house, to own a car, to have a normal life. My salary lasts 10 days, and I have to borrow money to cover the rest of the month. It's very bad.\"I ask about US President Donald Trump, and his threat of military strikes if the regime kept killing protesters.\"We're waiting to see what Trump does,\" he told me. \"In the meantime, civilians are getting killed.\"The force with which Iran's leaders have crushed this protest signals their weakness.  The regional proxy groups they once used as defences against attack have been weakened by Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and by the fall of the former Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.And the Israeli-US war with Iran last year has depleted its military capabilities, and left it vulnerable to attack.Hidden behind this mountainous border, Iran's regime is re-imposing its control.But hidden behind that repressive control is the growing fear of the Islamic Republic, unable to meet its people's most basic demands: protection from foreign attacks, and prosperity at home.Additional reporting by Samantha Granville and Maad Mohammed",

    "body": "A man has gone on trial in Germany charged with driving his car into a crowd of people in the city of Munich last year, killing two people.The 25-year-old man, named only as Farhad N, in line with German privacy laws, is an Afghan national.Prosecutors say that on the morning of 13 February 2025, he deliberately drove his BMW Mini into a trade union demonstration in the centre of Munich. About 1,400 people were taking part in the street rally.A 37-year-old woman called Amel and her two-year-old daughter Hafsa died in hospital of their injuries shortly afterwards.They were the hit by the car first and thrown several metres by the force of the impact. Hafsa was still in her buggy.Among the 44 others who were hurt, a number suffered critical injuries.Those taking part in the union rally included city workers such as hospital and daycare staff calling for better wages. Amel herself had been working as an engineer and had come to Germany from Algeria at the age of four.Farhad N went on trial on Friday only a few hundred metres from the scene of the attack. Federal prosecutors say they believe he \"committed the crime out of excessive religious motivation. \"He believed he was obliged to attack and kill randomly selected people in Germany in response to the suffering of Muslims in Islamic countries,\" they say.According to investigators, the man shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" and prayed after committing the act.He is also accused of watching extremist preachers online, however officials do not believe he was part of any jihadist movement such as Islamic State.At the start of the trial the defendant hid his face behind a red folder and raised his right index finger – a common gesture among Muslims worldwide, symbolising belief in one God.His lawyer said his client would not comment on either the attack or his personal circumstances.Officials say he arrived in Germany in 2016 as a teenager. Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 at the height of Europe's migrant crisis - an influx that has proved deeply divisive and fuelled the rise of the far-right AfD.Farhad N came alone, without his family and, although his asylum request was rejected, he was not deported and had been given temporary residency in Munich.German authorities said he was legally resident in Germany, had a work permit and had jobs working as a shop security guard and for security companies.Farhad N had no previous convictions. He was active on Instagram, where he posted about bodybuilding and religious themes.He was arrested on the day of the Munich attack. The trial is expected to continue until June.",

    "body": "In the middle of the night on Monday, Rachel Bloor stirred in her bed to find a heavy weight curled up on her chest.Half asleep, she reached out for her dog - and instead found herself petting a smooth, slithering object.As Bloor retreated further under the covers and pulled them up to her neck, her partner switched on the bedside lamp and confirmed the Brisbane couple's fears.\"He goes, 'Oh baby. Don't move. There's like a 2.5m python on you,\" Bloor told the BBC.Her first words were expletives. The second, an order to evacuate the dogs.\"I thought if my Dalmatian realises that there's a snake there... it's gonna be carnage.\"The dogs secured outside the room - and her husband wishing he was with them - Bloor began carefully extricating herself.\"I was just trying to shimmy out from under the covers... in my mind, going, 'Is this really happening? This is so bizarre'.\"She believes the carpet python - which is non-venomous - had squeezed itself through the shutters on her window and onto her bed below.Once freed from the python, she began casually feeding it back out the way it came in.\"It was that big that even though it had been curled up on me, part of its tail was still out the shutter.\"\"I grabbed him, [and] even then he didn't seem overly freaked out. He sort of just wobbled in my hand.\"The same couldn't be said for her stunned husband, but Bloor herself was barely fazed, having grown up on acreage around snakes.\"I think if you're calm, they're calm.\"Though if it had been a cane toad - one of the country's most damaging, and ugly pests - that would be another story, she said.\"I can't stand them, like they make me dry retch. So if it was a cane toad, it would have scared me.\"All animals and humans escaped from the interaction unharmed.Carpet pythons are constrictors that are common in coastal areas of Australia, and usually eat small animals such as birds.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMallory MoenchWatch: 'The Islamic Republic will fall', says exiled crown princeThe exiled son of the last Iranian shah (king) has called on the world to help protesters topple Iran's government, saying he is confident \"the Islamic Republic will fall - not if, but when\".Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition leader, asked the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guard leadership, which he said would \"facilitate our task and prevent more loss of life\".More than 2,500 protesters have been killed, according to a human rights group, in demonstrations that started over the economy on 28 December and turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei.The Iranian government has called the protests \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent figure in Iran's fragmented opposition and has previously urged Iranians to escalate their protests. But protesters have been met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.Speaking on Friday at a news conference in Washington, Pahlavi claimed that sections of Iran's security apparatus had refused to take part in the crackdown and that the Iranian authorities had brought in fighters from foreign militias to quell the protests.He urged the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and command and control infrastructure, calling for a \"surgical strike\". He also asked global powers to deliver economic pressure, expel Iranian diplomats, demand the release of all political prisoners, and deploy satellite internet Starlink and other secure communications to allow connectivity in Iran.\"The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully,\" he said.\"With or without the world's help, the regime will fall. It will fall sooner and more lives will be saved if the world turns its words into action.\"He declined to speak about reports that he had held discussions with senior US officials, but said: \"I believe that President Trump is a man of his word and, ultimately, he will stand with the Iranian people.\"Trump has previously warned Iran's government against killing protesters and told CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if it executed protesters.He later said he had been told \"the killing has stopped\" - but did not rule out military action against the country. Iran's parliament speaker had warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets. The US and UK have reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, with officials telling CBS News it was a \"precautionary measure\".Who is Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah?On Friday, Pahlavi also vowed to return to Iran and laid out a plan for creating a new constitution in the country.Asked about future leadership in Iran, he said: \"It's for the Iranian people to decide.\"He said he believes he can lead and has the Iranian people's support: \"I am trying to help them liberate themselves,\" he said.Pahlavi said he supported a governing programme based on the principles of Iran's territorial integrity, a separation of religion and state, individual liberties and the right of the Iranian people to decide on the form of democratic government they want.Pahlavi's father, the last shah of Iran, was overthrown in an Islamic revolution in 1979 and a devout Shia Muslim regime took over.The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Iran's capital Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency.They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year\".According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,595 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 17 children, 164 people affiliated with the security forces or government, and 21 uninvolved civilians.It reports that another 22,104 protesters have been arrested.The Iranian government has imposed an internet blackout on the country since 8 January, with authorities stepping up their crackdown on protests.The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.Residents in four cities - Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan and Sanandaj - told the BBC on Friday there were no protests taking place. Security forces were still present on the streets and in public squares, some said.",

Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.  Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen.Some of them held red banners that read: \"Yoon, again! Make Korea great again\". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn.On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister.\"The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them,\" the judge said. Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on FridayYoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power.He had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues.South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty.Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in a decisive victory . But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president  retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers.

    "body": "8 hours agoEd Habershon,JohannesburgandNatasha BootyThe US has accused South Africa's defence ministry of refusing to obey orders from its own government to send home Iranian warships that have been conducting naval exercises in the African country's waters. \"South Africa can't lecture the world on 'justice' while cozying up to Iran,\" it said in a statement.In response, South Africa's defence ministry said it was launching an inquiry to get to the root of these \"serious allegations\".Washington has criticised South Africa for inviting Iran at a time when a brutal crackdown against protests was happening in the Middle Eastern country. It said the South African military's actions did not amount to \"non-alignment\" but were instead a \"choice to stand with Iran\". \"This is absolutely no surprise. Protests against the Iranian regime are happening right now, human rights organisations here in SA have been calling for support for the protesters,\" William Gumede, an associate professor at the University of Witwatersrand, told the BBC. \"These are all democratic violations and human rights abuses and we have not heard a whimper from the ANC. That is the irony and hypocrisy, it's been criticising other regimes but it's been silent on what's happening in Iran.\"In the strongly worded statement posted on its social media accounts, the US embassy in South Africa said it noted with \"concern and alarm\" reports that the country's defence minister and its defence forces had defied government orders to ask Iran to leave. The US embassy said Iran's participation \"undermined maritime security and regional stability\" and was \"unconscionable\" as it suppressed protests back home, comparing them to \"peaceful political activity South Africans fought so hard to gain for themselves\". On Friday the office of Defence Minister Angie Motshekga said she \"would like to place it on record\" that President Cyril Ramaphosa's instructions had been \"clearly communicated to all parties concerned, agreed upon and to be implemented and adhered to as such\".Dubbed \"Peace Resolve\", the week-long naval drill got under way last Friday. It is being led by China - and involves other members from an alliance of major developing countries, including Russia, which when it was launched in 2006 was known as Bric.It took its acronym from its founding members Brazil, Russia, India and China - and when South Africa joined four years later an \"s\" was added to its name.With the recent addition of Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the alliance is now called Brics+ - and its aim is to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier Western nations.Iranian warships had already arrived in Cape Town when the order to turn them around reportedly came through.

    "body": "20 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondent, Beijing When Daidai realised her father was too old to slaughter two pigs for a traditional community feast in the run-up to Chinese New Year, she turned to social media.She didn't want him to feel bad.\"Can anyone help me?\" she asked on Douyin, China's version of Tiktok, at the end of last week. \"My father is old. I am worried that he can't handle these pigs.\"Daidai, who's in her 20s, promised that those who came to their village, Qingfu, to assist would be treated to a pork banquet.In rural Sichuan and Chongqing, large community meals are an important part of culture, featuring twice-cooked pork, steamed ribs, soup and homemade liquor.\"Let me hold my head up high in our village,\" she said.Her appeal for help attracted more than a million likes and the response on the ground was like a scene from a cheesy feel-good movie, as thousands of cars poured in, carrying many more people than she needed for the task.So many responded that traffic jams have brought roads in this part of rural Chongqing in south-west China to a standstill. Drone images show carloads of people queuing up with rice crops on either side hoping to still enter Qingfu. Walking in from long distances has been a traffic-beating option for some.Daidai posted that drivers coming into the area should be careful on the roads, especially those from the city unaccustomed to conditions in the countryside.\"The atmosphere has been great. It reminded me of my childhood when my family still kept pigs. It has been years since I felt anything like that,\" one man, who drove more than 100 kilometres (65 miles) to get there, told the BBC.He has seen licence plates from all over the country, he said.When the pig slaughter and subsequent mass banquet did happen, it was watched live online by more than 100,000 viewers, registering 20 million likes, and the local government embraced it as a flash-tourism moment.With many more people in town than two pigs could feed, tourism officials donated more pigs to meet the huge demand, and small restaurants have been serving crowds of visitors in outdoor seating areas.Yet what this phenomenon has shown is how quickly a small matter can become something massive in the age of social media.\"I thought maybe a dozen people would come,\" Daidai told Chinese media. \"But there have been too many to count.\"The response has also been driven by what seems to be a yearning from Chinese people to get back in touch with community cultural events, as well as a need for positive experiences when life can, at times, seem very dark.Daidai couldn't believe how quickly it's all happened. Last Friday she posted her request for help. By Saturday the response was so large that she went to the police to warn them that there could be disruption in the village and extra officers were brought in to manage the situation.The banquet celebration, by then huge in size, went on for two days – 1,000 diners on 11 January became 2,000 the next day – with bonfires into the night and much partying, accompanied by a band.Eventually, Daidai posted that her celebration was over, urging any more visitors to enjoy the region but not visit her home. After sleeping for only four hours over two days, she said she was exhausted.However, it had been an incredible moment for her and her village.To all the strangers who answered her call she said, \"without your enthusiasm and passion, there would not have been a feast like this\".\"For everyone who came, the feeling was like that of a big family. It was really warm, really healing and really meaningful.\"She thanked government officials and the police for allowing a sudden celebration of this size to proceed.It is already being predicted that the now famous Hechuan region, where her village is located, may try to turn this into a regular event, to tap into the enthusiasm for genuine, grass-roots interaction in a world where many feel isolated and removed from their culture.One villager was quoted in the People's Daily as saying: \"Here neighbours help each other. Today I might help you slaughter a pig at your place, tomorrow you will come to my place to do the same.\"As for Daidai's father, she said in an interview: \"My dad is very happy. Seeing this many people arrive he had to borrow tables and chairs from other villagers. We've never experienced anything like this.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoLaura Bicker,Beijing ,Suranjana Tewari,Singapore ,Koh Ewe,SingaporeandJessica Murphy,TorontoReutersMark Carney's visit to China is the first by a Canadian leader in nearly a decadeChinese leader Xi Jinping and Canadian PM Mark Carney have announced lower tariffs, signalling a reset in their countries' relationship after a key meeting in Beijing.China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.  He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's  biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\".He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\".\"We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be,\" he said when asked about China's human rights record.Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all.And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor.Carney said the \"world has changed dramatically\" and how Canada positions itself \"will shape our future for decades to come,\" he added. Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a \"new world order\". He later added that the multilateral system had been \"eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut\". As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: \"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.\" Getty ImagesCarney in the Great Hall of the People during the meeting with Xi  A trade reset Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs.Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025.In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate.The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs.As well as relief for canola producers, there will also be reduced tariffs on Canadian lobsters, crabs, and peas.China is Canada's second-largest trading partner but it's still a long way behind the US in volume.Economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney. On arrival in Beijing on Wednesday, he met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant.On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation.The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.A frosty history The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017.That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer  at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US.Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied.Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021.Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also \"managing leverage\".Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as \"extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage\".\"That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline,\" he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media.Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a \"narrower, more specific\" manner.\"We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ,\" he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in \"broad discussions\". Canada and China have \"different systems\", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. \"But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.\"",

    "body": "Myanmar has denied committing genocide against the Ronhingya people, saying The Gambia has failed to provide enough proof, as it begun its defence at the UN's top court.Ko Ko Hlaing, a Myanmar government representative, told judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the allegation was \"unsubstantiated\".Earlier this week, The Gambia's foreign minister Dawda Jallow told the court Myanmar wanted to erase the minority Muslim population through its use of \"genocidal policies\".Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during an army crackdown in Myanmar in 2017.A damning report issued by the UN the following year said top military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocide in Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas.Myanmar - which has been under military control since it overthrew the civilian government in 2021 - rejected the report and has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats.On Friday, Hlaning told the ICJ that \"Myanmar was not obliged to remain idle and allow terrorists to have free reign of northern Rakhine states\", where the majority of Rohingya lived.\"These attacks were the reasons for the clearance operations, which is a military term referring to counter-insurgency or counter-terrorism operations,\" Hlaing said.The Gambia launched its case against Myanmar in 2019, with Jallow telling the ICJ it did so out of a \"sense of responsibility\" following its own experience with a military government.Jallow told the court on Monday that the Rohingya \"had suffered decades of appalling persecution and years of dehumanising propaganda\", which was followed by the military crackdown and \"continual genocidal policies meant to erase their existence in Myanmar\".Lawyers for the Muslim-majority West African country also argued that the killing of women, children and the elderly, along with the destruction of their villages, was hard to justify under combatting terrorism. \"When the court considers... all of the evidence taken together, the only reasonable conclusion to reach is that a genocidal intent permeated and informed Myanmar's myriad of state-led actions against the Rohingya,\" said Philippe Sands, arguing for The Gambia, which has the backing of 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in its action.More than a million Rohingya refugees now live across the border in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar region alone - some of the largest and most densely populated camps in the world, according to the UN's refugee agency.Hlaing - the Myanmar government representative - said on Friday that it was committed to \"achieving the repatriation to Myanmar of persons from Rakhine State currently living in camps in Bangladesh\". But he also said external forces, such as Covid-19, had hampered those efforts.\"Myanmar's commitment and constant efforts since 2017 contradict Gambia's narrative that Myanmar's intention is to destroy or forcibly deport this population,\" Hlaing told the court.He added that \"a finding of genocide would place an indelible stain on my country and its people\", so the outcome was of \"fundamental importance for my country's reputation and future\".The court has also set aside three days to hear from witnesses, including Rohingya survivors, but these sessions will be closed to the public and media.A final ruling is expected towards the end of 2026, Reuters news agency reported.It is expected to set a precedent in other genocide cases, including one brought by South Africa against Israel over the war in Gaza, as it is the first to be heard in more than a decade - and is being seen as an opportunity for ICJ judges to refine rules around the definition of genocide.The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which The Gambia accuses Myanmar of breaching in its treatment of the Rohingya, was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. It defines genocide as crimes committed \"with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoJamie WhiteheadBBC News ReutersCIA director John Ratcliffe met Venezuela's Interim President Delcy Rodríguez in Caracas on Thursday \"at President Trump's direction,\" a US official has said. The two-hour meeting was aimed at building trust and communication following the US seizure of Venezuela's former president Nicolás Maduro almost two weeks ago. Ratcliffe and Rodríguez discussed potential economic collaboration and that \"Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries\", according to the US official.The meeting took place on the same day Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president, where she announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment - a move away from Maduro's policies. During her speech to the nation, Rodríguez said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically through political dialogue,\" adding Venezuela had to defend its \"dignity and honour\".President Donald Trump has said US oil companies will move into Venezuela and make money that will go to people there and to the US, with a top official saying the US would control sales of sanctioned Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\".Trump has asked oil companies to invest at least $100bn (£75bn) in Venezuela, but one executive said last week the country is currently \"uninvestable\".Rodríguez, the former vice-president, was sworn in on 5 January after US forces seized Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in an operation in Caracas. They are now detained in New York, where they have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges.The US official described the meeting between Rodríguez and Ratcliffe as \"historic\", adding that Ratcliffe was the first cabinet-level official to travel to Venezuela.The meeting also happened on the same day that Trump met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in Washington, who presented the US president with her Nobel Peace Prize winning medal. In her state of the union address, Rodríguez told Venezuelans it was \"very difficult\" to deliver Maduro's annual report, saying that the two were working on the speech together until six hours before his seizure on 3 January.Noting the US is a nuclear power, the interim president said she was not afraid to engage in diplomacy, saying \"we have to go together as Venezuelans to defend sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and also defend our dignity and our honour\".She continued that if she needed to travel to Washington DC to meet with Trump, she would do so \"walking on her feet, not dragged there\". She added that \"all of Venezuela is threatened\", and called for national unity to \"wage the diplomatic battle\".In her address, Rodríguez announced the proposal to reform the country's hydrocarbon law, saying she had asked the legislative body to approve it.Until now, Venezuela's hydrocarbon law has stated foreign partners must work with the country's state-owned oil and gas company, PDVSA - which must hold a majority stake. The reforms, Rodríguez said, would allow investment to flow to new fields. She said she had instructed her government to create two sovereign funds - one for social protection so that \"foreign currency goes directly to hospitals, schools, food, housing\" and the second for infrastructure and social development to invest in water, electricity and roads.Venezuela has been facing an economic crisis, with a sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. Before the US operation to seize Maduro, Venezuelans told the BBC they were concerned about what they were going to eat.\"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive,\" one man said. Rodríguez's reforms come as Trump and American investors eye opportunity in Venezuela, which holds the world's largest proven oil reserves.Bosses of the biggest US oil firms who attended a meeting at the White House last week acknowledged that Venezuela represented an enticing opportunity.But they said significant changes would be needed to make the region an attractive investment.Trump said his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate.\"You're dealing with us directly. You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela,\" he said.Trump also said that \"one of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices\".Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since crude oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago.Chevron is the last remaining major American oil company still operating in the country.Watch: BBC Verify examines claims Venezuela \"stole\" US oil",

    "body": "17 hours agoWill GrantBBC's Cuba correspondent in HavanaWatch: Public pay their respects to Cubans killed in Venezuela during US raidFrom sunrise, throngs of military personnel, government officials and civilians lined the route between Havana's airport and the Armed Forces Ministry to applaud home the remains of 32 Cuban troops killed in Venezuela as they passed by in a funeral cortege.The country's leadership – from Raul Castro to President Miguel Diaz Canel – were at the airport to receive the boxes carrying the cremated ashes of their \"32 fallen heroes\".In the lobby of the ministry building, each box was draped in a Cuban flag and set next to a photograph of the respective soldier or intelligence officer beneath the words \"honour and glory\".But despite the pomp and full military honours, this has been a chastening experience for the Cuban Revolution.First, it is believed to be the biggest loss of Cuban combatants at the hands of the US military since the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is.It is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world.Getty ImagesSome 32 Cubans were killed during the US military invention in VenezuelaBut that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana.Furthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas.It is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country's security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties.In short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy.In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as \"a terrific person\".Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of \"narco-terrorists.\"It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela.Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution.However, one of its \"original generation\" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt:\"If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest\" he said, quoting Raul Castro. \"They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women.\"\"If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela\", he says. \"Out here, things would be very different.\"Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che GuevaraIn the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military.In truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region.The stakes for Cuba are particularly high.The island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels.It's into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario.But former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour.Cuba doesn't want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won't be looking to escalate matters with Washington.\"But that doesn't mean we won't be ready\", he adds, defiantly.",

    "body": "14 hours agoLeehyun Choi,SeoulandKelly NgGetty ImagesThis verdict comes more than a year after Yoon's short-lived martial law decreeSouth Korea's beleaguered ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been found guilty of abuse of power, falsifying documents and obstructing justice when he tried and failed to impose martial law in the country in 2024. He has also been sentenced to five years in jail.Yoon is facing three other trials for charges ranging from insurrection to violating campaign law. The verdict comes more than a year after his short-lived decree threw South Korea into political turmoil, leaving it deeply divided.Here's what to know about the key charges laid against Yoon.Obstruction of justiceOn Friday, Yoon was found guilty of obstruction of justice by evading arrest; abuse of power by not convening a cabinet meeting before his martial law declaration; and falsifying official documents.Prosecutors accused him of using state institutions \"for personal purposes\" to conceal wrongdoing and undermine constitutional checks and balances.In January last year, it took some 3,000 police officers, over two attempts, to finally take Yoon into custody for questioning over the insurrection charge.Yoon had mobilised a large group of security officers who formed a human wall inside his residence to block the arrest - a move that a special prosecutor investigating the charge said was unprecedented.Yoon, meanwhile, argued the Corruption Investigation Office that attempted to arrest him lacked jurisdiction to investigate insurrection charges.The chaos surrounding the arrest, and the earlier failed attempt, \"demonstrated apparent lawlessness by Yoon, [his] conservative party, and South Korea's domestic security institutions\", said Mason Richey, an associate professor at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\"The obstruction of justice trial is a way to ensure accountability for these,\" he said.InsurrectionUnder South Korea's constitution, sitting presidents are immune from criminal persecution, except for on charges of insurrection and treason. Yoon was charged on 26 January 2025. By then, parliament had voted to impeach him, but he was not yet removed from office.Prosecutors allege that Yoon attempted to subvert the constitution by declaring martial law in the absence of war or any national emergency.In particular, he's been charged over how he mobilised troops and police to seal off the National Assembly compound to prevent lawmakers from blocking his decree, and how he ordered the arrests of the National Assembly speaker and then-leaders of the main political parties.Yoon had earlier claimed he declared martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea - but it soon became clear he was spurred by his own political troubles.Prosecutors have sought the death penalty, describing Yoon as \"unrepentant\".South Korea has not executed anyone since December 1997.AFP via Getty ImagesYoon's decree and the subsequent legal proceedings have prompted scores, both supporters and opponents, to take to the streetsFormer president Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled South Korea in the 1980s as a military dictator, was sentenced to death for leading an insurrection, though this was later reduced to life imprisonment. His ally and successor Roh Tae-woo was handed a lengthy jail term for his part in the insurrection. Both were eventually pardoned.Prosecutors have argued, however, that Yoon's 2024 martial law attempt \"tarnished the nation's dignity far more severely\" than the military coup Chun and Roh staged in 1979.\"We all saw how he disrespected the courtroom, smirking and laughing amongst his lawyers during witness testimonies. That did not help his case at all,\" said law professor Lim Ji-bong.Lim believes the judge will hand down a life sentence, though, so as to \"avoid making Yoon a martyr\". A death sentence carries political risk as it may further alienate Yoon's supporters and deepen chaos in the country, he said.US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee believes Yoon will ultimately be pardoned no matter what sentence he receives, as Chun and Roh were. \"It's a customary thing about Korean politics,\" Lee said. \"Whatever the sentence, it's a symbolic acknowledgement of how severe the crime is.\"ReutersIt took some 3,000 police officers to finally arrest Yoon in January last yearAiding an enemy stateProsecutors have also alleged that Yoon tried to provoke North Korea into attacking the South so as to justify his martial law declaration. In putting forward this charge, the prosecution relied on evidence found on former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung's phone that contained words suggesting potential provocations. They also cited a memo which appeared to push for a move to \"create an unstable situation or seize an arising opportunity\".This trial, which opened on Monday, will look at whether Yoon ordered drone flights into the North to induce military conflict between the Koreas, among other things. Yeo and Yoon's former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun have also been indicted on the same charge.Other chargesYoon has also been accused of perjury, for when he testified during former prime minister Han Duck-soo's trial last year on charges of aiding the insurrection. Prosecutors allege that Yoon falsely testified by claiming he had long planned to hold a cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Investigators said Yoon had no such plan and only convened a meeting at Han's urging.Apart from charges related to his martial law attempt, Yoon has also been indicted in a series of other cases. He is among 33 people charged for allegedly obstructing an investigation into the death of a young marine officer in 2023, and for aiding the suspect in this case.He has also been charged for meddling in the 2022 presidential elections and making false statements during his campaign.

    "body": "7 hours agoJake Horton,Ghoncheh HabibiazadandSarah JalaliBBCCrowds of mourners appear to have been fired on by a security official at a cemetery in Iran.The incident happened in Abdanan, in west Iran, on Tuesday as people gathered to commemorate those killed during the government's brutal crackdown on protesters last month.Iranians usually hold commemoration ceremonies on the 40th day after someone dies. The events have been held in several cities across the country to mourn the thousands killed during the deadliest nights of protests on 8 and 9 January.Verified video also shows people shouting anti-government chants at events in Tehran, Mashhad and Abdanan on Tuesday as crowds gathered at cemeteries and in the streets for commemorations.State-organised ceremonies were broadcast on TV and attended by senior government and military officials where people were led by organisers to chant \"death to America\".BBC Verify and BBC Persian have verified footage of people chanting \"death to Khamenei\", referencing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An armoured vehicle is then seen driving past the crowd of mourners as an apparent security official opens fire. People are heard screaming and seen fleeing the area as two gunshots ring out.The person who appears to be in uniform is seen pointing the gun away from the camera when the first shot is fired, before pointing the gun towards the crowd when a second shot can be heard. A puff of smoke near the gun is visible after each shot.Another verified video from the cemetery shows smoke in the distance as people run away from the scene and several gunshots can be heard.State-run IRIB News claimed that the event was peaceful and reports of people injured or killed were not true.XA billboard in the background of one the videos shows a picture of Alireza Seydi, a teenager from Abdanan who was understood to have been killed during the protests in Tehran last month and appears to be one of those commemorated during the ceremony.Weeks of anti-government protests started in late December which began over the economy but rapidly escalated. It peaked on 8 and 9 January after Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, called for nationwide protests to take place. Thousands of people were killed in one of the deadliest government crackdowns in recent years. BBC Verify previously reported that it had spread to more than 68 towns and cities across the country.Khamenei last month acknowledged that thousands had been killed during the protests and blamed the US for the deaths.Additional reporting by Daniele Palumbo and Shayan Sardarizadeh",

    "description": "16 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesPeru's Congress has ousted interim President José Jerí just four months after he took office for failing to disclose ",
    "body": "16 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesPeru's Congress has ousted interim President José Jerí just four months after he took office for failing to disclose meetings with Chinese businessmen.The scandal unfolded last month after videos emerged of Jerí meeting several times outside his official schedule with businessman Zhihua Yang, who was under government scrutiny.Jerí had previously apologised for the meetings, but denied any wrongdoing and accused his rivals of a public smear campaign.His removal from office makes him the third consecutive president to be ousted, after he replaced former leader Dina Boluarte, who was impeached in October last year.Jerí was Peru's seventh president since 2016 amid a tumultuous political landscape that has seen a succession of leaders leave the post under contentious circumstances.While lawmakers had set a date to discuss impeaching Jerí, in the end they opted for a different parliamentary procedure called censure, which only required a simple majority to pass rather than the super majority needed for an impeachment.Later on Wednesday, Congress will name a new interim president who will serve only for a few months - until a new president is chosen by the people in a general election this April. Jerí had come under fire following a series of controversies dubbed \"Chifa-gate\" - after a local name for Chinese-Peruvian fusion food and the restaurants which serve it.Security camera footage of Jerí's meetings with Yang, who owns several businesses and was granted a state concession for an energy project, was first reported by local media.In one of the videos, Jerí could be seen wearing a hooded top during a late-night visit at one of Yang's restaurants.Also present at one of the meetings was another Chinese citizen who was under house arrest while being investigated for alleged links to an illegal timber network.Peruvian law requires presidents to document all their official activities, but Jerí did not record those meetings.Jerí faced further criticism after it emerged that state contracts had been awarded  to a number of women following late-night meetings they had with him in the presidential palace.Ruth Luque, one of the lawmakers who backed the censure measure, said she wanted a leader who would put public interest and security first.\"We ask to end this agony so we can truly create the transition citizens are hoping for,\" she said, according to Reuters news agency. \"Not a transition with hidden interests, influence-peddling, secret meetings and hooded figures. We don't want that sort of transition.\"Pressure had been mounting for Jerí to resign in the wake of the scandals as he faced a corruption investigation launched by the attorney general and his approval ratings plummeted.His removal marks another chapter of instability for Peru, which is due to hold a general election in April, after which power will be transferred to a new president.Less than a week after Jerí assumed power, protests organised by young Peruvians demanding the political class to do more to combat crime and corruption left one dead and more than 100 people injured.Correction 18 February: An earlier version of this article said José Jerí had been impeached as Peru's president. This was later updated to say he had been ousted by Congress to better reflect the parliamentary procedure used to remove him from office.",

    "body": "9 hours agoRobert GreenallGetty ImagesSpanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.He was detained while staying at a Madrid hotel, where he was accused of racking up charges of more than €20,000 during several stays.Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system, and was the first of its kind to be detected.Their investigation began after suspicious activity was reported by a travel booking site. It took just four days to complete - the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyber attack, getting the system to authorise his transaction after entering only one cent as the charged amount.Police said that the transaction had at first appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount - €0.01 - to the hotel company.Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His latest stay there was for four nights, normally costing €4,000. They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.The police statement appears to suggest that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were given.ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.",

    "body": "10 minutes agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trumps met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House in November, the first such meeting in the country's history The US is preparing to largely withdraw its remaining troops from Syria over the next few months, a senior White House official has told the BBC.The official said the Syrian government has agreed to take the lead combatting terrorism within its borders and US military presence \"at scale\" is no longer required.American troops have been in Syria since 2015, as part of an anti-terrorism campaign to counter the influence of the Islamic State (ISIS).The decision came as US President Donald Trump ramps up military presence in the Middle East as tensions mount with Iran. The official noted that the decision to remove the roughly 1,000 remaining troops from Syria is part of a conditions-based transition, and that the US remains ready to respond to any threats in the region.The news - first reported by the Wall Street Journal - comes amid an increased presence of US troops in the Middle East, specifically near Iran. BBC Verify has confirmed the location of US aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln - equipped with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets - near Iran.The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, expected to arrive in the region within the next three weeks.Senior national security officials told the BBC's media partner CBS News that Trump said the US military would be ready for potential strikes on Iran as soon as  Saturday, though Trump has not yet made a final decision.In Syria, US troops had already departed two bases earlier this year, the al Tanf garrison in southern Syria and the al Shaddadi base in the northeast.The movements follow the collapse of the Assad government in 2024, and a weakened Islamic State amid considerable security improvement in Syria.Since then, the Trump administration has sought to strengthen its diplomatic ties with Damascus and increase its partnership with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa.Sharaa visited Trump in the White House in November, the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.The Syrian leader's government has at times clashed with local military groups but struck a deal in January that would integrate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with Syria's armed forces.Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with his Syrian counterpart, Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, last week, to discuss maintaining the ceasefire. Rubio also expressed his concerns about the continued fight against terrorism.In December, a translator and two members of the Iowa National Guard were killed in an ambush attack by a lone ISIS gunman, the Pentagon said. The Trump administration launched a series of attacks against ISIS in response, called Operation Hawkeye Strike.The BBC's Bernd Debusmann contributed to this report.",

    "body": "18 hours agoKelly NgGetty ImagesAustralia has barred a citizen linked to the Islamic State (IS) group from the country for up to two years.The person is among the group of 34 Australian women and children who tried to head home after being released from a Syrian camp earlier this week, only to be turned back by Syrian authorities for \"technical reasons\".The ban was issued \"on advice from security agencies\", Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday, adding that the other 33 people do not meet \"required legal thresholds\" to be banned.Canberra has refused to repatriate the group, believed to be made up of the wives, widows and children of IS fighters. There are 23 children among them.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stressed that these families will not receive government support to come back to the country.\"You make your bed, you lie in it,\" he told a press conference on Wednesday.\"These are people who chose to go overseas to align themselves with... a brutal, reactionary ideology that seeks to undermine and destroy our way of life.\"However legal experts have warned the government has an obligation to allow citizens the right of return, and, responding to reports the group had valid Australian passports, Albanese said his government would not \"breach Australian law\".This group in the al-Roj camp in northern Syria is among dozens of Australians who have been held in camps and prisons across the country since 2019, when IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria.Opposition politicians have raised security concerns about the possibility of these Australians' return. \"How can only one member of this group be deemed a risk and the rest somehow okay?\" Liberal Party Senator Jonno Duniam said on Tuesday, offering to help amend laws to bar more of the group.The al-Roj camp is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities, mainly women and children. Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.Speaking to ABC, the camp's director Hakmiyeh Ibrahim made an appeal to all countries that have citizens held in limbo there: \"Take your citizens, take these children and women\".The children especially are growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp, she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"Several of these camps have made headlines as the women and children living in them are severely malnourished and lack access to basic resources.Several other foreign governments - including France, the Netherlands, and the UK - have also refused to repatriate most of their citizens still held in Syria.",

    "body": "Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal3 hours agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos deal\"Do not give away Diego Garcia,\" US President Donald Trump has said as he criticised the UK's plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back an important military base.Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia... in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.\"Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said Trump's latest comments was \"an utter humiliation\" for Starmer.\"It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether,\" she said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump's latest change in position showed that the UK needed to pursue closer ties with Europe.\"Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail,\" Davey wrote in a post on X.\"Britain can't rely on the US while Trump is in the White House. It's time to strengthen our ties with allies we can depend on, starting with our neighbours in Europe.\"In response to the US president's latest post, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage - an outspoken critic of the UK handover plan - praised Trump's criticism of London's handling of the issue.\"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history,\" he wrote on X. \"President Trump is right to say the Prime Minister is making a big mistake. Starmer must cancel this deal.\"Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.",

    "body": "21 hours agoJoel GuintoGetty ImagesSara Duterte has feuded spectacularly with President Bongbong MarcosPhilippine Vice-President Sara Duterte has declared her candidacy for president in the 2028 elections.The 47-year-old's announcement comes as she is embroiled in a bitter power struggle with current President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.While the presidential vote is two years away, contenders in the Philippines' largely personality-based elections are known to prepare for years in advance.Marcos is ineligible for re-election and his allies have yet to field a challenger to Duterte - who is also the daughter of his predecessor, former president Rodrigo Duterte.\"I offer my life, my strength, and my future in the service of our nation,\" the vice-president said.\"I am Sara Duterte. I will run for president of the Philippines.\"Marcos and Duterte ran under the same ticket in the 2022 election, which they won by a landslide. But the alliance soon unravelled as they pursued separate political interests.Two months later, a mid-term legislative vote, seen as a barometer of support for the incumbent government, delivered a victory for candidates endorsed by the Duterte family, against those handpicked by Marcos.Just over a week ago, members of the Catholic clergy filed an impeachment complaint against the vice-president over alleged corruption, which she denies.Who is Sara Duterte?Sara is Rodrigo Duterte's eldest daughter and is widely-considered as his political heir.The elder Duterte once described his daughter as the \"alpha\" in their family, the one whom everyone follows.Sara served as vice-mayor to her father when he led Davao city in the 2010s. It was in that southern metropolis that the Duterte's built their reputation for being tough on crime, which they have described as necessary to keep people safe and encourage businesses to grow.Sara was thrust into the national spotlight when, in defence of shanty town dwellers, she punched a Davao sheriff in full view of TV news cameras.She was Davao city mayor when her father was president from 2016 and 2022, and her alliance with Marcos in the 2022 elections was pivotal for both their election victories.The vice-president, like her father, projects a tough image. She rides large motorcycles and has given her children nicknames like Sharky, Stonefish and Stingray. She also shares matching tattoos with her two brothers.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesUS billionaire Les Wexner, who is alleged to have played a key role in helping Jeffrey Epstein build his wealth, has said he was \"naive, foolish and gullible\" for trusting the late sex offender.In a statement to US lawmakers, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret lingerie brand accused Epstein of stealing \"vast sums\" of money from his family when working as his financial adviser.Wexner, who was testifying to a congressional panel as part of its Epstein probe, has denied any wrongdoing. Lawmakers accused him of knowing about Epstein's crimes, and failing to stop them.He was described as a potential co-conspirator of Epstein's in a 2019 FBI document, but no charges were ever brought against him.Wexner was called before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on Wednesday to answer questions about his relationship with Epstein in the wake of the release of thousands of documents related to the financier's wrongdoing.Members of the committee travelled to Ohio, the retail mogul's home state, for the testimony. Only Democratic lawmakers attended the deposition. No Republican lawmakers travelled for it, though some of their staff members did attend.\"We should be very clear that there would be no Epstein island, there'd be no Epstein plane, there'd be no money to traffic women and girls,\" congressman Robert Garcia, of California, said. \"Mr Epstein would not be the wealthy man he was without the support of Les Wexner.\"Watch: Watch: Democrats say Les Wexner provided \"financial support\" to Epstein following depositionWexner, in his opening statement, defended those mentions by saying his relationship with Epstein was limited, and denied any knowledge of the convicted sex offender's abuse.\"I was naive, foolish and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,\" he said. \"He was a conman. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.\"He said he was \"pleased to testify\" and wanted \"to set the record straight\". Wexner also said he had visited Epstein's private island for \"a few hours\" with his family.The pair's relationship dates back to the 1980s and Wexner has said he cut ties after Epstein was accused of sexually abusing children in Florida.Wexner said he later discovered Epstein \"had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family\", a statement he repeated in his opening remarks.The retail magnate was identified in a 2019 FBI document as a potential co-conspirator. A separate email also said there was \"limited evidence regarding his involvement\".Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche previously said Wexner's name \"appears in the files thousands of times\".Wexner's lawyers recently told the BBC: \"The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.\"Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduCourtesy Photo/US Air ForceAn artist rendering of the new plane colours provided by the US Air ForceThe US presidential jet is getting a new paint design that will include one of President Donald Trump's preferred colour choices for the White House and his hotels, gold. Air Force One and other planes used by high level US officials, including First Lady Melania Trump, are being repainted gold, deep red and navy blue as they undergo scheduled repairs and maintenance, according to the US Air Force.The colours will also feature on a new luxury 747-8i Boeing plane donated to the presidential fleet by Qatar, an Air Force spokesperson told CBS.The white, blue and robin's egg blue associated with the presidential jet have been in use since the 1960s, when John F Kennedy was president.Trump has called for updates to the executive fleet since his first term. His successor, former President Joe Biden, cancelled a broad makeover Trump had initially planned.The new colours have already been spotted on model aircraft seen at the White House, where Trump is also making his aesthetic imprint, from the large-scale plans for a new ballroom to the more subtle installation of signs in a curling font in gold.The private plane Trump travelled on during his 2024 campaign, sometimes called \"Trump Force One\", used the same colour palette that will be given to the presidential fleet.While it is not clear how much the paint jobs will cost, the US Air Force, which operates the executive planes, said in a statement to the BBC that the new colour requirements were \"not expected to result in additional delays or costs to the program.\"It added that it was implementing the new colour scheme on the Boeing VC-25B (a variation of the Boeing 747) currently used to transport the president, as well as four C-32 jets often used as \"Air Force Two\" for the vice-president, and the jet donated by Qatar. Painting has been completed on of the C-32 aircraft.AFP via Getty ImagesAir Force One in its current coloursPreparations began last summer for the Pentagon to refit the Qatari jumbo jet that is expected to serve as Air Force One. The Boeing aircraft - valued at $400m (£300m) - was donated by Qatar as an \"unconditional\" gift, with any necessary retrofitting costs being borne by the US government.While any plane where the president is a passenger is called \"Air Force One\", the holder of the highest office in the country most often flies on a specialised jet that includes an office, a bedroom suite, two kitchen galleys that can prepare 100 meals, office space and a medical facility, according to Boeing.",

    "body": "8 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAFPA feminist anti-immigration group said Quentin Deranque had been helping to protect its members in LyonTwo more people have been detained by French authorities investigating the killing of a far-right student activist by suspected radical left militants in Lyon, bringing the total in custody to 11.Quentin Deranque, 23, suffered a fatal brain injury when he was beaten and kicked during a demonstration last week on the sidelines of a conference held by Rima Hassan, a member of the European Parliament for hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI).The wave of arrests began on Wednesday, and included a parliamentary aide to LFI politician Raphaël Arnault.Arnault said his assistant, Jacques-Elie Favrot, had halted all his work in parliament and his contract was being terminated.Even before his arrest, Favrot's lawyer said he formally denied responsibility for the activist's death and was unable to continue his duties because of death threats.Although the radical left party leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has sought to distance the party from Deranque's violent death, LFI has come under attack from rivals across the political spectrum, less than a month before France votes in key municipal elections.Government spokesperson Maud Bregeon has urged the party to suspend Raphaël Arnault from its parliamentary group because of the MP's links to Anti-Fascist Young Guard, which has been blamed for the violence a short distance from Sciences Po University in Lyon.The political climate is febrile ahead of the March votes - seen as the last test of public opinion before next year's presidential elections. Within the past month Sébastien Lecornu's minority government had to survive two no-confidence motions to push through this year's budget.LFI party co-ordinator Manuel Bompard announced on Wednesday that the party's Paris HQ was briefly evacuated because of a bomb threat, and went on to accuse a large cross-section of the political and media classes of making days of false and defamatory statements.\"I call for an end to this absolutely despicable exploitation of the tragedy that took place last Thursday evening in Lyon, for which France Unbowed bears absolutely no responsibility,\" he told reporters. \"This climate should worry everybody.\"AFPThe attack last Thursday took place a short distance from Sciences Po university in LyonVideos captured from the scene show three people lying on the ground coming under attack from a larger group, all of them wearing hoods.A feminist anti-immigration group called Némésis said Deranque had been outside the venue to protect its members. Némésis has blamed Young Guard for the attack - an allegation it denies. A minute's silence was held in the National Assembly on Tuesday for the young activist, and politicians lined up to criticise the radical-left leader and his colleagues.Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally said Mélenchon had \"moral and political responsibility\" for what had happened and even former LFI MP Alexis Corbière called on the party to take stock politically of what had happened.Sébastien Lecornu said that \"without undermining the presumption of innocence\" LFI had to \"clean up\" its statements, ideas and its ranks fast.Mélenchon hit back, saying he refused to take lessons from Lecornu.However, more moderate figures on the left such as Socialist ex-President François Hollande have accused LFI of being responsible for lowering the tone of politics in France.\"It's clear there can be no alliance in the municipal elections between the Socialists or reformist left-wing parties and LFI in the second round,\" Hollande said on Wednesday. \"The relationship is over.\"For months the party had indulged in a kind of \"brutalisation\" of debate so there was no political space between the far left and far right, said Hollande.The actions of police have also come in for criticism, as local forces were warned that Rima Hassan's event was due to take place but riot police were not on the scene at the time of the fatal attack.The death of Deranque has prompted reaction across the border in Italy, where Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has described the attack as deeply shocking and \"a wound for the whole of Europe\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: Eight of the nine missing skiers located deceased, officials sayRescue teams combing through the backcountry of California's Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.The search for a final missing skier continues but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts \"challenging emotionally\". Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a \"football-field\" sized avalanche came barreling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 PST (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.Watch: California hit by heavy snow as avalanche leaves skiers missing\"I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,\" Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.The bodies of the eight dead skiers are still trapped in the snow and can't yet be recovered due to \"pretty horrific\" conditions, officials said.Since the avalanche, another 3ft (.9m) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.\"The hazard remains high,\" he said.Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.Officials say the victims are seven women and two men.Sheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse \"extreme weather conditions\" using specialised equipment.At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and \"could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche\", Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour. The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that state authorities were \"co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort\" with local emergency teams.Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as \"treacherous\".\"Avoid the back country,\" he said. \"Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.\" The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a destructive potential scale of D1 to D5, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center, which would mean it was over half a mile in length and would have a deposit of around 6.5ft (2 metres). The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in (76cm) of snowfall since Tuesday.The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.",

    "body": "Stephen Colbert says CBS spiked interview with Democrat over FCC fears1 day agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesUS late-night host Stephen Colbert has accused his network of refusing to broadcast an interview with a Democratic politician over fears of retaliation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).CBS, the network which hosts the programme, denies that it \"prohibited\" the interview from being aired, saying it gave only \"legal guidance\".On Monday night's show, Colbert said that CBS would not show his interview with Texas lawmaker James Talarico out of concerns about a response from the FCC, which has new guidance on equal airtime for political candidates.\"We were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,\" he said.\"Then, then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.\"Colbert, host of The Late Show, went on to explain that new FCC guidance on the \"equal time\" rule - which requires certain TV and radio broadcasters to give equal time to rival political candidates - could have created legal trouble for the network, according to CBS lawyers.The FCC regulates radio, TV and satellite airwaves, giving it power over a range of matters, including mergers and decency complaints.CBS flatly denied Colbert's claims in a statement on Tuesday.\"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep James Talarico,\" the network said. Talarico, 36, is a Democratic candidate for a US Senate seat in Texas. CBS added in a statement: \"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates... and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. \"The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.\"The full interview was later posted on YouTube, where FCC rules do not apply.News content has traditionally been exempted from the \"equal time\" rule.But the FCC has said the rule may soon apply to late-night programmes like Colbert's. It may also apply to political radio programmes, which tend to have more conservative hosts and listeners.After issuing the new guidance in January, Brendan Carr, the FCC chairman known for taking an expansive view of his power, said on X that \"for years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programmes - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. \"Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\" US President Donald Trump has at times said he is considering pulling the FCC licence for several US networks that he says have aired views critical of his presidency. Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, agreed in July to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute with Trump regarding an interview it broadcast on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.Business commentators have questioned whether the deal was made partly so as to not affect Paramount's planned merger with Skydance Media, which Trump had the power to halt.CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC board, condemned the response by CBS, saying Colbert and the network had the First Amendment constitutional right to free speech.\"This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech,\" she said in a statement, adding that the FCC had \"no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes\".She continued: \"It is no secret that Paramount, CBS's parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.\"She has previously accused the FCC's Republican leaders of using the equal-time rule to unfairly penalise critics in violation of the constitutional right to free speech. The Late Show is due to end its 33-year run in May. Colbert has been the host since 2015.",

Oh my God.\"Sides, who has been dancing for 60 years and teaches ballroom dancing classes, said she had signed up for TV extra work with an agency, and responded to a call-out for senior dancers on behalf of an \"unknown artist\". After being shortlisted, Sides received a call confirming she had been specifically chosen by the artist out of hundreds of applications.But she had no idea record-breaking Swift was behind the request.Sides said the whole experience was \"hush-hush\" and all she had been told was that the job involved recreating a dance competition.It was only ten minutes before filming began that she found out the video was for a track from Swift's latest album, The Life of a Showgirl.Sides, a Swiftie herself, said she was in shock when the singer walked in.\"I still feel excited now [remembering it],\" she said.Sides said Swift, who sang in and directed the video, put everyone at ease during filming and thanked dancers for their time. \"She knew exactly what she wanted. She'd say, 'try this, try that,' and she was really nice about it,\" said the dance teacher.\"Some can be a bit abrupt but she wasn't. She was lovely and so talented.\"In the video, Sides can be seen wearing a royal blue ballroom dancing outfit she has owned since becoming a professional dancer in 1988.She said Swift complimented her outfit and said: \"I love your dress. It really fits the set.\"TAS Rights ManagementGraham Norton's chat show played a role in the video's castingWhen Sides saw the video, which was filmed in November but released earlier this month, she said she was gobsmacked.\"You just can't believe it's you,\" she said.It was difficult to keep the experience a secret too, she added: \"It was hard, I only told a few people in my dance class and my family.\"Opalite features Domhnall Gleeson, Lewis Capaldi, Greta Lee and a cameo voiceover from Cillian Murphy, all of whom appeared on the Graham Norton show with Swift in October.It tells the story of a lonely woman who uses a magical spray to improve her life and finds romance with a fellow loner.Matt Crossick / PA MediaThe video's cast all featured on Graham Norton's chat show last OctoberDespite dancing her whole life and with decades of acting experience, Sides said the shoot with Swift was the most important of her career. She said she hoped her experience would inspire others to try dancing.\"Maybe people will think, 'Well, if Taylor chose her, why don't we?',\" she said.\"You're never too old. It was an experience I will never, ever forget.\"In addition to running Dens Dance Studio since the 1990s, Sides also hosts inclusive workshops for those with disabilities.\"If I'm not teaching, I'm dancing myself,\" she said. \"That's my happy place, my passion.\"More top stories",

    "body": "Suspect in Rhode Island ice hockey shooting killed ex-wife and son 21 hours agoChristal HayesWatch: High school hockey players recount Rhode Island ice rink shootingTwo victims shot dead at a high school ice hockey game in Rhode Island have been identified as the suspect's ex-wife and son, police said on Tuesday.Robert Dorgan - who police said also went by the names Roberta Esposito and Roberta Dorgan - was found dead inside the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket on Monday, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after what authorities said was a targeted attack.Dorgan's ex-wife, Rhonda Dorgan, and adult son, Aidan Dorgan, died. Rhonda's mother and father along with a family friend were injured. All three were in a critical condition at hospital.Police have not given a motive, but said it appeared to be a family dispute.Video of the incident showed shots fired while players were on the rink, sparking panic as the teams scrambled to leave the arena, which is located a few miles from the state capital of Providence.Asked at a news conference on Tuesday if the shooting followed a confrontation, Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said no.She said two guns recovered from the scene - a Glock 10mm pistol and a SIG Sauer P226 - were legally owned.Goncalves told reporters a bystander \"stepped in and interjected\" and \"that's probably what led to a swift end of this tragic event\".The Boston Globe via Getty ImagesCourt documents show that Rhonda Dorgan filed for divorce from Robert Dorgan, 56, in February 2020. In the petition she wrote \"gender reassignment surgery, narcissistic + personality disorder traits\" as grounds for their divorce. Those words appear to have been crossed out and replaced with \"irreconcilable differences\".That same month, the shooter filed a police report asking authorities to file charges against the father-in-law, alleging he had threatened to have Dorgan killed.Dorgan's father-in-law was alleged to have used a derogatory term for transgender people, and police filed a criminal charge against him which was later dismissed.The police chief said officers were combing through thousands of the suspect's social media posts, but added that Dorgan's gender identity was \"irrelevant to the investigation at this point\".\"What I can tell you is the identification was in the name of Robert and then we also know that the suspect went by the name Roberta,\" said Gonclaves on Tuesday. \"It appeared that the suspect was in female clothes yesterday, but again, that's nothing that had swayed the investigation, one way or another.\"A family statement posted for an online fundraiser said: \"Our family has been forever changed by the tragic events at Lynch Arena.\" It added: \"In addition to this unimaginable loss, their grandparents are currently in critical condition, fighting for their lives.\"General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, a naval contractor based in Bath, Maine, confirmed that Dorgan was one of its employees.The company said in a statement: \"We extend our deepest sympathies to the victims, their families, and all those affected by this tragedy.\"Authorities have spoken to dozens of witnesses to the attack. Many families were watching the game and ran in fear as gunfire broke out.Melissa Dunn, whose son played for one of the hockey teams, said she saw paramedics performing CPR in the stands of the arena after she ran back inside to find her son.\"You don't know what's going on at first,\" Dunn said. \"You just hear the loud noises. And we're used to the kids banging on the board with their skates, so we thought it was that at first.\"She said she screamed for her son to duck and avoid gunfire.\"We ran out of the rink… your first thought is 'where's my kid?'\" she said. \"I tried to get back in the rink, and I actually got back in there to find out where he was, and I saw them doing CPR in the stands and it was just really disturbing.\"",

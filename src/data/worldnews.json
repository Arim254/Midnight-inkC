    "body": "Scientists have unearthed Australia's oldest known crocodile eggshells which may have belonged to \"drop crocs\" - creatures that climbed trees to hunt prey below.The discovery of the 55-million-year-old eggshells was made in a sheep farmer's backyard in Queensland with the findings published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.The egghells belonged to a long-extinct group of crocodiles known as mekosuchines, who lived in inland waters when Australia was part of Antarctica and South America.Co-author Prof Michael Archer said \"drop crocs\" were a \"bizarre idea\" but some were \"perhaps hunting like leopards - dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner\".Prof Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales, said mekosuchine crocodiles - which could grow to about five metres - were plentiful 55 million years ago, long before their modern saltwater and freshwater cousins arrived in Australia about 3.8 million years ago.The \"drop croc\" eggshells were discovered several decades ago but only recently analysed with the help of scientists in Spain.\"It's a bizarre idea,\" Prof Archer said of the \"drop crocs\",  but some were probably \"terrestrial hunters in the forests\".The findings add to earlier discoveries of younger mekosuchine fossils - found in 25-million-year-old deposits in another part of Queensland.\"Some were also apparently at least partly semi-arboreal 'drop crocs',\" Prof Archer said.Since the early 1980s, he has been part of a group of scientists excavating a clay pit in Murgon, a small regional town about 270km (168 miles) north-west of Brisbane.Over the decades, it has become known as one of Australia's oldest fossil sites as it used to be surrounded by a lush forest. \"This forest was also home to the world's oldest-known songbirds, Australia's earliest frogs and snakes, a wide range of small mammals with South American links, as well as one of the world's oldest known bats,\" Dr Michael Stein, a co-author of the report, said.Prof Archer recalls how in 1983, he and another colleague \"drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard\".\"After explaining the prehistoric treasures that might lie under their sheep paddock and that fossil turtle shells had already been found in the area, they grinned and said 'of course!'.\"And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we've already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseA US naval strike force centred around the world's largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, has arrived in the Caribbean, the US Navy has confirmed. The arrival of the strike group, which was ordered to the region by President Donald Trump last month, comes amid ongoing strikes against alleged drug boats and tensions with Venezuela. The US has so far carried out at least 19 strikes against boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, killing at least 76 people. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials have accused the US of \"fabricating\" a crisis and seeking to topple the country's left-wing socialist government. The aircraft carrier movement also comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\".Petro on Tuesday ordered his country's public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US agencies until the boat attacks in the Caribbean stop.He wrote on X that the fight against drugs \"must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".In a statement, the US Navy said that the strike group entered the area of responsibility of US Southern Command - which oversees Latin America and the Caribbean - on 11 November. The force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which itself includes more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of aircraft. The strike force also includes guided-missile destroyers and various other vessels. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the force will \"bolster US capacity to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit actors and activities that disrupt the safety and prosperity\" of the US and will help \"disrupt narcotics trafficking\" and criminal groups in the region. The carrier group is joining substantial military forces already deployed in the region, including thousands of troops, a nuclear-powered submarine and military aircraft based in Puerto Rico. Collectively, they form the largest US presence arrayed in and around Latin America in decades. The US has continued to launch strikes on alleged drug boats in the region. The Trump administration says the attacks are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US. Earlier this week, the US announced it had conducted two additional strikes in the Pacific, killing six people. In addition to fueling tensions with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela, the strikes have led to concerns from some observers about violations of human rights and due process. Colombia's Petro has also faced criticism as well as US sanctions over his reluctant response to drug-trafficking groups. On Tuesday, Colombia's military officers revealed that they had launched their own deadly airstrikes against a drug-running guerrilla group in the Amazon region, killing 19, AFP reported.Earlier in November, Trump downplayed suggestions he was planning to topple the Venezuelan government or start a war. In an interview with CBS - the BBC's US news partner - Trump said that \"every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\" ",

    "body": "'This animal spared my life': Biologist bitten in head by shark hopes to meet it again21 hours agoRafael AbuchaibeBBC News MundoMauricio HoyosMauricio Hoyos has spent 30 years studying the behaviour of different shark speciesMauricio Hoyos still remembers the pressure that the jaws of a female Galapagos shark, over 3m (10ft) in length, exerted on his skull.The animal had lunged at him with astonishing speed, giving him barely enough time to duck his head in a last ditch effort to protect his jugular vein.\"When it closed its jaw, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then, after what I think was a second, it opened it again and it let me go,\" Hoyos told BBC Mundo from his home in Baja California, Mexico, a little over month after surviving the incident.Hoyos, a marine biologist with over 30 years of experience studying sharks in their natural habitat, was on a research trip in Costa Rica when he was attacked by the shark in September.Less than two months on, and still bearing the scars from the attack on his face, he describes his recovery as \"incredible\" - and says he even hopes to encounter his assailant again.Hoyos calls the shark bite \"a battle scar that looks like gills\"For Hoyos, what happened to him that day in the waters off Cocos Island is the result of normal animal behaviour when confronted with a perceived threat. \"In this case, this bite was like a dog's,\" he says.\"Have you ever seen how dogs, when another dog gets too close, throw a quick bite? It doesn't hurt it, but it calms the other dog down.\"Hoyos - who along with his colleagues attaches acoustic tags to sharks to help pinpoint their mating and spawning grounds as part of his work - was alerted to the shark's presence in the water by tourists.It was at a depth of 40m, and Hoyos told the captain of the boat he was on that he would be there \"for a maximum of five minutes\".He then entered the water and began his slow descent.Getty ImagesGalapagos sharks can grow 3m in lengthHoyos recalls encountering the shark: \"This giant female, measuring between 3 and 3.5m (11.5ft), swam by and headed toward the bottom, and I positioned myself to tag her at the base of her dorsal fin.\"But Hoyos, who has tagged many kinds of sharks in his decades-long career, says this animal reacted differently to others.\"Obviously the tip - the metal tip attached to the cable hanging from the probe - goes in, and unlike the other sharks I've tagged that immediately flee, she turns around and stares at me,\" he recalls.\"I saw her little eye looking at me, and I saw her very calmly turning around.\"Hoyos and his colleagues tag sharks with probes like this oneHoyos says he held the shark's gaze as it swam away - but then, suddenly, out of nowhere, it lunged at him.\"I lowered my head, and what I felt was its lower jaw digging into my cheek and its upper jaw into my head. I was there, I imagine for a second, no more, inside its jaw, and then it simply opened it again.\"\"When it closed it, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then it just let me go,\" he marvels.The Galapagos shark's 29 serrated teeth not only left Hoyos with deep wounds to his face and head, but also severed the air line of his diving apparatus.He had survived the shark attack but was still in mortal danger.In addition, one of the teeth had torn his diving mask, and the blood-tinged water was further blurring his already limited visibility.\"When I realised that no air was coming out of the hose, I grabbed a second one we have, which we call an octopus, that is used to give air to someone else if they need it,\" he tells BBC Mundo. \"But then I realised that the regulator wasn't working and was blowing air instead of regulating it, so I had to remember my training and start regulating it with my lips.\"Bleeding, blinded, and with the air escaping, Hoyos calculated that he had less than a minute to reach the surface.\"Since I couldn't see anything, what I did was look for the light that I knew was the surface. I started swimming upwards, in a very coordinated manner, because I wanted to avoid erratic movements that would attract the shark.\"Mauricio HoyosHoyos had to use all the lessons he had learned during years of diving to survive the attackAfter Hoyos reached the surface, a young man pulled him aboard the boat, and when the captain saw his condition, he called the park ranger station to report the incident.Hoyos explained that he didn't feel the pain of his injuries until much later.\"Obviously, I had adrenaline in my system, but the bite didn't hurt that much. What hurt the most was the impact: when the shark bit me - an animal 3m long and at that speed - it was like being hit by a car. In fact, I ended up with a huge bruise all over my jaw; I thought it was broken.\"When they docked, a team of paramedics was ready to provide him with emergency care.Hoyos was lucky: as well as surviving the attack and the subsequent ascent, none of his wounds became infected, and the healing process took less time than anyone could have imagined.\"The doctors told me it was amazing: the attack happened on 27 [September], I had a 34-hour trip, they performed a surgical debridement [removing damaged tissue], and two days later they were already evaluating whether they could perform reconstructive surgery.\"It could have been far worse for Hoyos. According to the doctors, a young man who survived a Galapagos shark attack in the same area in 2017 had to remain in a hyperbaric chamber for almost a month because his wounds weren't healing properly.\"They told me my recovery had been incredible. After the surgery, the doctors confessed how worried they had been about an infection, because being on my face, it was a direct path to the brain.\"Mauricio HoyosSmiling broadly, Hoyos adds that he is already planning to get back into the water and has a diving trip booked for 14 November.And he says that after having survived an attack of this magnitude he has even more respect for the animals he studies.\"Many people think the oceans would be better off without sharks, but they really say that because they don't understand the crucial role sharks play in maintaining their delicate balance.\"Pointing to the large scar on his cheek, he says: \"This is the proof that this female spared my life; I can't put it any other way. And this will allow me to continue speaking well of sharks and advocating for their conservation in the future.\"Meanwhile, the Galapagos shark that had Hoyos in its jaws continues its natural life in the depths, and he hopes to see it again. And since he was able to mark it before it attacked him, that possibility exists.\"In January I'm going to Cocos Island, we have a trip from the 20 to 27. And obviously I'm going to Roca Sucia [where the attack happened], I'm going to dive down there,\" he says, undeterred.",

    "body": "Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of John F. Kennedy, will run for US Congress, he told his supporters on Tuesday. The only grandson to the late former president JFK, Schlossberg, 32, is best known for his provocative and outspoken political commentary online. He is seeking to fill the congressional seat being vacated by New York Representative Jerrold Nadler, who announced in September that he would retire after more than three decades in office.In an interview earlier on Tuesday, the son of the Kennedys' daughter Caroline told the New York Times that he felt his Democratic Party needed more voices to \"push back on perceived abuses of power by President Trump and his allies\".With almost 2 million followers collectively across Instagram and TikTok, the Kennedy heir has been open about his goals to make politics accessible for younger voters. In 2024, he was announced as Vogue's political correspondent in the lead-up to the US election, in part due to what the publication called his \"silly goose\" antics online. He told the magazine that he was inspired by his family's legacy of public service, and said he wanted to contribute \"in my own way\". Naming his grandfather, who was assassinated in 1963, as his hero, Schlossberg told Vogue that JFK's administration was \"a blueprint for how progressivism can work in America\". Shortly after announcing his campaign, Schlossberg shared a series of videos and links to his social media accounts, urging his followers to donate \"so we can win\". His campaign website declares a \"new generation of leadership\" for New York, and makes \"12 promises to the people of New York's 12th district\". \"This is our last chance to stop Trump - it won't come again,\" it reads.Schlossberg has been vocal about his opposition to the Trump administration, which includes his estranged cousin Robert F Kennedy Jr. Despite being a relative, he is especially critical of the US health secretary, whom he has called a \"loser\". Schlossberg's decision comes as Democrats are hoping to regain control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections.\"There is nothing our party can't do to address costs of living, corruption and the constitutional crisis that we're in,\" he told the New York Times on Tuesday. \"But without the control of Congress, there's almost nothing that we can do.\"Schlossberg has been hinting for months at his possible run for the seat. A number of other Democrats have also announced campaigns for NY-12, including state assemblymen Micah Lasher and Alex Bores, and veteran journalist Jami Floyd. Newly elected New York City mayor and fellow millennial Zohran Mamdani has not yet endorsed a candidate in the primary.",

    "body": "Australia's spy chief says hackers linked to the Chinese government and military are targeting the country's critical infrastructure, warning the country was increasingly at risk of \"high-impact sabotage\". Mike Burgess, head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), said \"unprecedented levels of espionage\" meant a growing threat of \"cyber-enabled sabotage\" in the next five years.He singled out \"one nation state - no prizes for guessing which one - conducting multiple attempts to scan and penetrate critical infrastructure in Australia\" and its allies, \"targeting water, transport, telecommunications, and energy networks\".The Chinese embassy has been contacted for comment.Authoritarian regimes were now more willing to \"disrupt and destroy,\" Burgess warned.He cited two Chinese hacking groups, Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, who have targeted telecommunications companies in the US and Australia. \"These groups are hackers working for Chinese government intelligence and their military,\" he told business leaders at a forum in Melbourne on Wednesday. \"Both groups were involved in the theft of sensitive information, but the real danger was the threat of sabotage - disruption to critical infrastructure.\"He said Salt Typhoon's intent was espionage, breaking into telecommunication networks in the US.\"And they have been probing our telecommunication networks here in Australia too,\" Burgess said. He said Volt Typhoon's actions were intended to be disruptive, with hackers compromising critical infrastructure networks in the US for potential, future sabotage.\"And yes, we have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well,\" Burgess said.He warned that authoritarian regimes are increasingly willing to sabotage critical infrastructure in order to \"impede decision-making, damage the economy, undermine war-fighting capability and sow social discord\". \"I do not think we - and I mean all of us - truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating, this could be,\" he said.Burgess pointed out that short telecommunication outages, unrelated to foreign interference, have had significant and widespread impacts on society.\"That's one phone network not working for less than one day,\" he said.\"Imagine the implications if a nation-state took down all the networks? Or turned off the power during a heatwave? Or polluted our drinking water? Or crippled our financial system?\"Spies are increasingly \"broadening their collection requirements\", Burgess said. \"They are aggressively targeting private sector projects, negotiations and investments that might give foreign companies a commercial advantage. And like criminals, they have been aggressively targeting customer data.\"The spy chief said conservative estimates showed that espionage cost Australia A$12.5bn ($8.2bn; £6.2bn) in 2023-24, with about $2bn worth of trade secrets and intellectual property stolen from Australian companies in one year.Burgess described the hackers' abilities as \"highly sophisticated, using top-notch tradecraft to find your networks, test for vulnerabilities, knock on digital doors and check the digital locks\".\"And when they have penetrated your networks, they actively and aggressively map your systems, and seek to maintain persistent undetected access that enables them to conduct sabotage at a time and moment of their choosing.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoAbdujalil AbdurasulovIn KyivThick fog has enabled Russian troops to move further into the key strategic city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's 7th Airborne Assault Corps says weather conditions, particularly dense fog, have prompted Moscow to intensify its bid to get increasing numbers into the ruined city and encircle Ukrainian forces.Russian forces have spent more than a year trying to seize the city. Ukraine's military says there may now be 300-500 Russians there and President Voloydymyr Zelensky says the situation remains difficult.Meanwhile, army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi says the situation on the front line in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region has \"significantly worsened\", with the loss of three settlements.Syrskyi said however that Russia was most active around Pokrovsk. A video has gone viral on social media showing Russian soldiers openly driving through a hazy road on civilian cars and motorbikes.The BBC has verified the location where the video was filmed as the southern outskirts of the town on the Selidove-Pokrovsk highway.For several days fog obscured visibility to carry out aerial reconnaissance, says a drone pilot from the \"Shershni Dovbusha\" unit of the 68th brigade with the call-sign \"Goose\".That's why, he told the BBC, the Russians had even \"dared\" to launch assaults using a column of vehicles, which would normally have been wiped out immediately by Ukrainian drones.The Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC his unit had regularly detected and eliminated small Russian groups trying to advance on foot and on motor bikes.  He added they were also involved in repelling the attack featured in the viral video, said to have been filmed on Sunday.The convoy was partly destroyed, \"Goose\" claims, however weather conditions meant there was no video monitoring of the moment they repelled the attack so he was not sure if the entire group was hit.A week ago, Zelensky estimated that up to 300 Russian soldiers were fighting in Pokrovsk. The video suggests those numbers have probably increased in that time and the military confirmed that on Wednesday, with southern areas of the city now under Russian occupation.Russian troops appear to be closing in on most areas of Pokrovsk, according to mapping by the Ukraine-based DeepState monitoring group. Some observers say that its fall is imminent.Most parts of the city are now in a grey zone that neither side fully controls, says \"Goose\". \"We might hold positions in one building, but the enemy can be in the next one. They're trying to get behind our backs,\" he says.Moscow is trying to encircle Pokrovsk and neighbouring Myrnohrad in what is known as a \"cauldron\".  Even if the \"lid\" is not closed, Russians can constantly target all routes in and out of it using FPV drones.To prevent such an encirclement, Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian troops back from Suvorove and Rodynske on the eastern part of the \"cauldron\", creating a bigger gap between Russian flanks.Russian forces are trying to cut off logistical routes supporting Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk.  They attack supply routes, not only remotely using drones and artillery but also by sending in soldiers on the ground, the Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC.This tactic is called infiltration and it has proved quite successful, says Ukrainian military analyst Kostyantyn Mashovets.He argues that Russian forces have specifically targeted Ukrainian FPV pilots so they do not have sufficient resources to detect the movement of smaller Russian groups.  In an urban environment, Russian soldiers sometimes infiltrate by dressing up as locals or as Ukrainian military, says Mashovets.  Their main goal is to cause chaos among Ukrainian defenders, which is then followed by a push from the main forces of the Russian army, he adds.The Kremlin is also trying to push in other parts of the front line – in Kupyansk in the north-east and in Zapporizhzhya region in the south.Viktor Tregubov, spokesperson of the Joint Forces Operation, denied Moscow's claim that they had managed to surround Kupyansk but admitted that Russian troops were present in the south of the town and the situation was difficult.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKoh Ewe and Jonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentWatch: Inside Shwe Kokko, the brand new city 'built on scams'She Zhijiang, a Chinese national accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, is being extradited to China - ending his years-long battle against the order.He has been detained in Thailand since 2022, after the Thai police arrested him acting on a Chinese request to Interpol. China accuses She Zhijiang of running illegal online gambling rings, and this week a Thai court upheld the decision to extradite him.  He arrived at a Bangkok airport on Wednesday, flanked by two security officials. His extradition comes ahead of a landmark visit by Thailand's king to Beijing - the first state visit to China by a reigning Thai monarch and a sign of deepening ties.Central Investigation Bureau, Royal Thai PoliceAfter a legal battle spanning more than three years, She Zhijiang is finally being handed to ChinaShe Zhijiang is one of the biggest names linked to the vast cyberscam hubs in South East Asia, which have trapped thousands of Chinese nationals and sparked a crackdown from Beijing.One of his most notorious projects is Myanmar's Shwe Kokko city, near the Thai border.It's portrayed in promotional videos as a resort city for Chinese tourists, but its glitzy buildings are allegedly home to fraud, money laundering and human trafficking.During a visit to the city earlier this year, the BBC saw very few overseas visitors. Local people there said that scam businesses were still operating.She Zhijiang and his company Yatai is sanctioned by the UK and the US for his links to rights abuses in the scam farms in their development.Speaking to the BBC from prison earlier this year, She Zhijiang maintained that his company would \"never accept telecom fraud and scams\" - though he also noted admitted that scammers were likely to enter Shwe Kokko since the city was \"completely open to anyone\".Courtesy YataiGambling hubs across South East Asia set up by She Zhijiang (centre) have been accused of housing scam operations and trafficking victimsWho is She Zhijiang?Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, She Zhijiang left school at 14 and learned computer coding.He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China. In 2014 a Chinese court convicted him of running an illegal lottery.But over the years he expanded his gambling business to Cambodia and other countries in the region.He also holds Cambodian and Myanmar citizenship, according to the US Treasury.The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in scam centres concentrated in South East Asia. They are often lured there by fake job offers and held against their will, forced to defraud others online or face brutal punishment.Many of them are Chinese nationals - a source of concern for Beijing. China has been ramping up crackdowns on such scam operations. In recent months it has sentenced multiple members of Chinese \"mafia\" families to death. ",

    "body": "19 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad and Dearbail JordanPakistan: Suicide attack outside Islamabad court kills 12A suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad has killed 12 people and injured at least 27 others, the country's interior minister said.Mohsin Naqvi said a bomber was planning to attack the district courthouse but was unable to get inside.Naqvi said authorities would prioritise identifying the bomber, and that those involved would be brought to justice.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that extremist groups \"actively backed by India\" were involved.A spokesperson for the Indian government denied what they described as \"baseless and unfounded allegations\".In a statement, Sharif said that \"terrorist attacks on unarmed citizens of Pakistan by India's terrorist proxies are condemnable\".Jumaat Ul Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), has claimed responsibility, according to local media. But two local journalists have told the BBC that the TTP's central leadership has sent messages to them saying it has no link to the explosion.Suicide blasts in Islamabad have been rare in recent years. Footage from the scene on Tuesday showed the remains of a burnt-out car and a police cordon in place.The 27 people injured are receiving medical treatment, Naqvi said.He added that the attacker detonated the bomb close to a police car after waiting for up to 15 minutes. Footage of the aftermath showed plumes of smoke rising from a charred vehicle behind a security barrier. The incident occurred at 12:39 local time (07:39 GMT).Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said he \"strongly condemned the suicide blast\". A lawyer who said he was parking his car outside the court at the time described hearing a \"loud bang\".Rustam Malik told AFP news agency \"it was complete chaos\".\"Lawyers and people were running inside the complex,\" he added. \"I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate and several cars were on fire.\"Police cordoned off an area close to a district court in Islamabad after the blastIn a separate incident on Monday, a car exploded in India's capital Delhi, killing eight people and injuring a number of others. The Indian government has not called the incident a terror attack, although the case has been referred to the country's anti-terror body.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said following the attack: \"The conspirators behind this heinous act will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice, no matter how deep the conspiracy runs.\"There is, however, no official word yet on what led to the blast.The last time Pakistan's capital was targeted by a suicide bombing was three years ago when a police officer was killed and several others injured.There have been suicide attacks in other parts of the country in the years since but not in Islamabad.

    "body": "24 minutes agoKhanyisile Ngcobo and Pumza Fihlani,Southern Africa correspondent, JohannesburgTwo brothers have been charged with the murder of South African rapper Kiernan Forbes, popularly known as \"AKA\", following their extradition from neighbouring Eswatini.Siyabonga and Malusi Ndimande were brought back to the country after the failure of a lengthy legal attempt to block their return.Forbes, an award-winning hip-hop artist, was killed outside a restaurant in the coastal city of Durban in 2023 along with his close friend, celebrity chef Tebello \"Tibz\" Motsoane.South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world but this shooting shocked the country.The brothers have also been charged with Motsoane's murder and will appear alongside five other accused already in custody when the trial begins. They also face charges of attempted murder and unlawful possession of a firearm, among others.They have not yet commented on the charges.The pair arrived at Durban's international airport on Tuesday under heavy police guard, with their hands and feet shackled.At the time of his murder, Forbes had been in Durban to perform during his birthday celebrations.Police described the attack on the two men as a coordinated hit. While it is believed that Forbes was the only target and Motsoane was an unintended victim, the motive remains unclear.The authorities believe that one of the Ndimande brothers was \"maybe one of [those who] pulled the trigger and shot AKA,\" police spokesperson Brig Athlenda Mathe told local broadcaster eNCA on Tuesday.The rapper's father Tony told local broadcasters that he was pleased with the progress in the case but still had questions over who ordered his son's murder and the motive.His mother Lynn posted an image of her and her son on Instagram alongside the caption: \"This South African air is suffocating today … I cannot breathe\".Forbes was one of South Africa's most celebrated hip-hop artists after releasing three solo albums.He is also known for his collaborations with other performers, including Nigeria's Burna Boy.The Ndimande brothers will return to court on November 25 for a bail hearing.The case against their co-accused will resume in the high court in Durban next year.",

    "body": "Two members of K-pop group NewJeans will return, record label says after legal battle2 hours agoKoh Ewe and Jake Kwon,Seoul correspondentGetty ImagesK-pop record label Ador says NewJeans members Hyein (left) and Haerin (right) will return to the agencyTwo members of NewJeans, Hyein and Haerin, will return to their record label Ador, the agency has announced, in a move that has led fans to question whether the K-pop group will now split up.NewJeans has been locked in a legal battle with Ador, since the five-member group announced last year that they were leaving the agency because of mistreatment and manipulation. Ador has denied these claims.Last month, a South Korean court ruled that NewJeans's contract with Ador - which runs until 2029 - remains valid. NewJeans said it would appeal. The dispute has rocked the K-pop industry, where record labels typically exercise strict control over their artists. Ador is a subsidiary label of Hybe, South Korea's biggest music label behind chart-topping groups such as BTS.In a statement on X, Ador wrote that Hyein and Haerin had decided to \"respect the court's latest ruling\" after \"thoughtful consideration with their respective families and thorough discussions with ADOR\".\"We request the warm support from the fans and respectfully urge you to avoid engaging in unfounded speculation regarding the members,\" the statement said.Plans for the other three members - Hanni, Danielle and Minji - are unclear.NewJeans's legal representative declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.Formed in July 2022, NewJeans, whose members are aged from 17 to 21, had a dramatic fallout with their agency in 2024.It was sparked by the controversial dismissal of Ador CEO Min Hee-jin, who had also been NewJeans's mentor.NewJeans then accused Ador of \"mistreatment\" and \"deliberate miscommunications and manipulation\", and set out several demands including the reinstatement of Min. When those demands were not met the five members declared they were leaving Ador, which in turn initiated a lawsuit to prevent them from departing.NewJeans' argument was ultimately rejected by the court, in a ruling delivered two weeks ago.After that ruling, NewJeans's lawyer said that the trust between the group and their management had been \"completely ruined\" and that the group would continue its fight.While NewJeans had pledged to appeal the ruling, legal experts generally agreed that they would have very little chance of winning, given how clearly the court had sided with Ador.The deadline for filing the appeal is the end of Wednesday. It is unclear if NewJeans has filed anything yet.ReutersNewJeans enjoyed rapid success since its debut in 2022, but have gone on hiatus amid legal troublesFans have expressed worries that the latest move would spell the end of NewJeans in its current configuration.\"If only two out of five members continue their contracts and the rest end things like this, that's basically a disbandment,\" one person wrote on X.\"It's too hard for an individual to fight a big company,\" wrote another. \"I just like the NewJeans girls ... I'll still support them.\"Since its debut, NewJeans had been poised for a meteoric rise, scoring early chart-toppers.Their first single Attention topped Korean charts while their hit song SuperShy made multiple \"best of the year\" lists at the end of 2023, including those compiled by Rolling Stone, NME and Billboard Magazine.But their drawn-out legal battle has forced them into a hiatus.When NewJeans rebranded themselves NJZ and tried to release a new song, their activities were halted by a court injunction initiated by Ador.Additional reporting by Hosu Lee.Watch: 'Trusting time' - NewJeans discusses court ruling in record label dispute",

    "body": "4 hours agoWatch: Trump says he has \"obligation\" to file BBC lawsuitUS President Donald Trump has said he has an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC over the way a section of his speech was edited in a Panorama documentary. Speaking to Fox News, he said his 6 January 2021 speech had been \"butchered\" and the way it was presented had \"defrauded\" viewers.It is the first time Trump has spoken publicly about the matter since his lawyers wrote to the BBC and said he would sue for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him.A spokesperson for the BBC said: \"We are reviewing the letter and will respond directly in due course.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has previously apologised for an \"error of judgement\" over the edit.Appearing on Fox News's The Ingraham Angle, the president was asked if he would go ahead with the lawsuit, responding \"well I guess I have to, you know, why not, because they defrauded the public, and they've admitted it\". Trump continued: \"They actually changed my January 6 speech, which was a beautiful speech, which was a very calming speech, and they made it sound radical.\"And they actually changed it. What they did was rather incredible.\"Asked again if he would proceed with the legal action, he said: \"Well I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can't get people, you can't allow people to do that.\"The Fox News interview was recorded on Monday, though the section concerning the BBC was not published by Fox News until late on Tuesday evening in the US.The BBC received the letter from Trump's lawyers on Sunday. It demands a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary, an apology, and that the BBC \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused\".It sets a deadline of 22:00 GMT (17:00 EST) on Friday for the corporation to respond. The BBC has said it will respond in due course.BBC News has contacted the BBC for comment on the president's latest remarks.If Trump sues in Florida, he would also need to establish the BBC Panorama documentary was available there. There is no evidence so far to suggest that it has been shown in the US.Since returning to the White House, Trump has made legal threats against other media outlets over their coverage of him. He settled with both CBS News and ABC News after receiving large payouts, and has sought to take legal action against the New York Times.The BBC edit appeared in a Panorama documentary which aired days before the US presidential election in November 2024, but only generated significant public scrutiny after a leaked internal BBC memo was published by the Daily Telegraph newspaper last week.In the memo, a former independent external adviser to the BBC's editorial standards committee raised concerns that a section of the speech had been edited in a way which suggested the president explicitly encouraged the Capitol riot of January 2021.Trump actually said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"However, in the Panorama edit two sections of the speech more than 50 minutes apart were spliced together.He was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The fallout has led to the BBC's director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigning.Both outgoing senior leaders have pushed back against critics who have said the episode raises wider questions about impartiality at the BBC.Speaking during an internal all-staff meeting on Tuesday, Davie said: \"We have made some mistakes that have cost us, but we need to fight\", adding that \"this narrative will not just be given by our enemies, it's our narrative\".He said the BBC went through \"difficult times… but it just does good work, and that speaks louder than any newspaper, any weaponisation\".Neither Davie nor the BBC chair mentioned Trump's legal threat during their address to staff on Tuesday.Downing Street has said this was a \"matter for the BBC\".\"It is clearly not for the government to comment on any ongoing legal matters,\" the prime minister's official spokesperson said.The row comes at a sensitive time for the BBC, with its royal charter - the agreement which underpins its governance and funding arrangements - due to expire at the end of 2027.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy will oversee talks on the terms of its renewal. She told the Commons on Tuesday those negotiations would \"renew its mission for the modern age\" and ensure a \"genuinely accountable\" organisation.Nandy continued: \"There is a fundamental difference between raising serious concerns over editorial failings and members of this House launching a sustained attack on the institution itself, because the BBC is not just a broadcaster, it is a national institution that belongs to us all.\"The culture select committee is expected to hear evidence from senior BBC figures in the coming weeks, including Shah and board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson.Former editorial standards adviser Michael Prescott, who authored the leaked memo which appeared in the Telegraph, will also be invited to give evidence.Elsewhere, an internal Reform UK email seen by BBC News confirmed the party is ending its co-operation with a documentary commissioned by the broadcaster about its rise.The email says the production team had been given \"unprecedented access\" to senior figures in the party, but that they should now withdraw consent for any footage to be used over the Trump row.

    "body": "Wife and son of Gabon's ousted leader given 20-year jail terms in two-day corruption trial3 hours agoFavour Nunoo,BBC Africa and Basillioh RukangaGetty ImagesSyvia Bongo (R) and her son were accused of exploiting former President Ali Bongo's (L) condition after he suffered a stroke in 2018A court in Gabon has sentenced the former first lady and the son of deposed President Ali Bongo to 20 years in jail following a two-day trial.On Tuesday night, Sylvia Bongo and Noureddin Bongo were found guilty of embezzlement and corruption after a trial that began a day earlier. They were not present.They were both fined 100m CFA francs ($177,000; £135,000), with Noureddin ordered to pay an extra 1.2tn CFA francs ($2.1; £1.6bn) for financial damages suffered by the Gabonese state.They were accused of exploiting Ali Bongo's condition after he suffered a stroke in 2018 to run Gabon for their own personal profit. They denied the charges ahead of their trial, describing it as \"a legal farce.\"Ali Bongo was ousted in an August 2023 coup led by Brice Oligui Nguema, who has since shed his military uniform and was elected president earlier this year.Following the military takeover, Bongo's wife and son were detained in Gabon for 20 months before being released in May and permitted to leave the country for London on medical grounds. The former president is not facing prosecution and was also released from house arrest where he had reportedly remained, although Gabonese authorities said he was free to move about as he wished.Gabonese state prosecutor Eddy Minang on Monday told the court that they were \"surprised\" not to see the former first lady and her son in court as the trial began.Noureddin described the conviction as a \"rubber-stamping exercise\", saying it had been \"predetermined in [Oligui Nguema's office] a long time ago\".He said it was \"disappointing that a finding of guilt has been made without any semblance of evidence\".Their conviction comes as a surprise for the unusual swift handling of the case, which they have alleged to be politically motivated. The trial had been expected to last until Friday.The trial of the other accused will continue. Nine co-accused, former allies of the Bongos, were present in court at the start of the trial, according to reports.AFP via Getty ImagesNoureddin Bongo was additionally ordered to pay $2.1bn to compensate the stateSylvia Bongo was born in France and holds French nationality as does her son. They have claimed they were tortured by the military during their detention in Gabon and filed a case in France last year. Gabonese authorities have denied the allegations.Noureddin was ordered to pay the extra $2.1bn fine due to his role as the General Coordinator of Presidential Affairs, a position that he allegedly used to embezzle this amount of public money.He was also accused of forgery as he reportedly had the president's signature and seal, which were allegedly used to siphon funds from the state. He denies all the charges.The Bongo family ruled Gabon for more than five decades. Ali Bongo was in power for 14 years before he was ousted. He had succeeded his father, Omar Bongo, who had ruled for 42 years.Over the years, the family has been accused of amassing wealth for themselves at the expense of the country - allegations they deny.Despite being an oil-rich nation, about a third of Gabon's population lives below the poverty line, according to the UN.Additional reporting by Yann Leyimangoye in GabonMore about Gabon from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 hour agoAna FaguyWashingtonGetty ImagesA budget that would end the longest shutdown in US history is heading to the House of Representatives for a crunch vote on Wednesday.On day 42 of the impasse, representatives are returning to Washington to decide whether to approve a Senate package that would fund federal agencies for two months.Republican leadership expressed confidence the spending plan would clear the lower chamber of Congress, despite their narrow majority. But top Democrats vowed to oppose it.President Donald Trump has indicated he will sign it into law. \"We're opening up our country,\" he said on Tuesday at a Veterans Day event in Arlington, Virginia. \"Should have never been closed.\"The shutdown, which began on 1 October, has left a million federal workers unpaid, halted food stamps for low-income Americans, and delayed air travel for flyers ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.With nearly 1,200 flights cancelled on Tuesday as unpaid air traffic controllers call in sick because of the funding deadlock, lawmakers are finding other ways to reach Washington.Congressman Rick Crawford of Arkansas posted on X that he was carpooling with a fellow Republican, Trent Kelly of Mississippi, to the nation's capital.Congressman Derrick Van Orden said he was riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle from his home state of Wisconsin.\"It's going to be a little chilly,\" he posted on X of the 16-hour trip. \"But I will do my duty.\"Watch: The moment US Senate approves bill that could end shutdownThe House Rules Committee advanced the bill in a procedural party-line vote by 8-4 in the early hours of Wednesday morning, capping a seven-hour session.Republicans on the panel brushed aside Democratic amendments seeking to extend expiring health insurance subsidies - their main demand during the impasse.The chamber is expected to reconvene at 16:00 EST (21:00 GMT) to hold one hour of debate on the legislation before a vote.House Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York vowed to fight the bill.\"We're strongly opposed as House Democrats to this reckless Republican effort to continue to raise the high cost of living on everyday Americans,\" he told CNN.Jeffries has expressed frustration with Senate Democrats who sided with Republicans on Monday night to pass the spending plan.A central demand of Democrats during the shutdown has been that Republicans attach to the spending bill a provision to extend tax credits that make health insurance less expensive for 24 millions Americans.But Republicans stayed united and refused to budge, agreeing only to allow a vote in December on the healthcare subsides, something they had offered weeks ago.And there is no guarantee that measure will even pass the Senate, while House Speaker Mike Johnson has yet to commit to a vote on the tax credits in that chamber.\"Government, just do your job\" - Frustration on Monday over shutdown flight delaysJohnson has kept the House out of session for 53 days to pile pressure on Senate Democrats to agree a shutdown compromise.Before Wednesday's vote he will swear in Arizona congresswoman-elect Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat who won a special election in September.Once she has taken the oath of office, the Republican majority in the House will be whittled down to five votes – 219-214.That means Johnson can only afford to lose two Republicans on any party-line vote.The budget leaves the federal government on course to keep adding about $1.8tn (£1.4tn) a year to its $38tn in debt.But Chip Roy of Texas said he was \"unaware of any opposition of significance\" to the bill from fiscal hawks in his House Freedom Caucus.Potential Republican defectors Thomas Massie of Kentucky or Victoria Spartz of Indiana have remained tight-lipped so far on how they plan to vote.But even if they do break ranks, the House Speaker could still get the bill over the line with the help of moderate Democrats, such as Jared Golden of Maine or Henry Cuellar of Texas.Neither party appears to have emerged politically unscathed from this legislative imbroglio.Opinion polls suggest voters believe Republicans shoulder slightly more of the blame, while Democrats were bitterly split by the brinkmanship.And once the shutdown is over, appropriators have just two months to avert the next one.Government funding would next be due to expire on 30 January.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "11 hours agoGuy DelauneyBalkans correspondentGuy Delauney/BBCRussian state-owned energy companies own more than half of Serbia's national oil firm NISAn impasse over Russian oil and imminent US sanctions has put Serbia at loggerheads with its traditional ally in Moscow.Added differences over Russian gas supplies and Serbia's arms trade have ramped up the tensions, with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic trading barbs with the Kremlin.The root of the problem, and the most pressing issue, is the fate of Serbia's national oil company.Russia's Gazprom and Gazprom Neft own more than half the shares of Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS). That has put the company in a tight spot, after US sanctions on NIS came into effect last month over its ties to Russia's energy industry.Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic has told the BBC that NIS's Russian owners have now asked the US for a waiver, which indicated \"the Russian side was ready to transfer the control and influence upon the company to a third party\". But she warns time is running out.The impact of US sanctions on NIS has been immediate. Its petrol stations have put up signs warning customers that Visa and Mastercard can no longer be used to pay for fuel, as the US credit card giants have stopped processing payments. The same applies to outlets of NIS's Russian shareholders. At a Gazprom service station on the motorway between Novi Sad and Belgrade, Bojan and his colleagues were taking no chances, pumping the petrol and diesel for their customers. That gave them the opportunity to check whether the drivers had the means to pay, and Bojan said about one in 10 customers did not – \"mostly foreigners\". A cash machine has been installed inside the service station just in case.Guy Delauney/BBCGazprom-owned service stations in Serbia are now only taking cashNIS operates both of Serbia's oil refineries, providing more than four-fifths of its petrol and diesel, and almost all its jet and heavy fuels.Serbia is landlocked, so it relies on Croatia to deliver oil via its Janaf pipeline. But since sanctions kicked in, the flow has been cut off.The refineries will run out of crude to process before the end of November, which is why the energy minister says time is running out.Serbia is not the only Balkan country grappling with US sanctions.Neighbouring Bulgaria has passed legislation to take over its only oil refinery from Russian oil giant Lukoil, ahead of sanctions kicking in on 21 November.Hungary's Viktor Orban has secured a one-year waiver from his ally President Donald Trump.At the start of November a queue of NIS tankers could be seen waiting for entry to the jet fuel storage facilities at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport, delivering supplies while they still could.National airline Air Serbia told the BBC that it was \"adjusting [its] business activities\" and had taken \"the necessary steps\" to ensure it could keep its planes in the air.Russia's shareholders have not been in a rush to sell their stakes in NIS, even though Belgrade says they are now prepared to act. Nationalisation would be another possibility, as in Bulgaria, but Serbia has been reluctant to follow suit, in large part due to its longstanding friendship with Russia. Unlike its neighbours it is not part of the EU, which has banned imports of Russian oil, although it is a candidate to join.Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool via REUTERSRelations between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Serbia's Aleksandar Vucic have cooled in recent monthsThe episode has undoubtedly strained relations with Moscow. Behind the scenes, there is a great deal of exasperation in Serbian government circles.The energy minister chose her words carefully, but her frustration was clear.\"The overall income in the Gazprom group of NIS is insignificant,\" Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic told the BBC.\"We know NIS is not crucial for Russia's energy sector and contributing significantly to any income for the Russian government. However, for Serbia it is very important.\"\"These [US] sanctions will harm Serbian people, because of the majority share that NIS has in the market. NIS employs 13,500 people in Serbia, so employees are important for us as well as stability in the market.\"Oil is not the only problem. Serbia also relies on Russian gas, delivered at a highly favourable rate. But the current supply deal expires at the end of the year – and Moscow seems in no rush to renew, leaving President Vucic \"very disappointed\".\"It is obvious we didn't get the gas agreement because there is a possibility that we could nationalise NIS,\" says Zeljko Markovic, a Serbian energy sector consultant.\"We can supply Serbia without Russian gas, but the question is at what price? We have been using Russian gas at a lower than market price. And are we prepared with the contracts and the capacities?\"Arms and ammunition exports have also soured relations with Russia. Serbia's defence companies have not supplied Ukraine directly, but they have made deliveries to third countries which then re-exported the munitions.Earlier this year, Moscow made it clear this was no longer acceptable – and President Vucic imposed an export embargo. But at the end of last month he changed tack, saying he was happy for Serbia to export arms and ammunition to EU countries, adding that the buyers could \"do what they want\" with the deliveries.This triggered a testy exchange between Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova and Vucic.There are signs of movement.If the bid for a US waiver works, then the sanctions will be lifted, and oil will start flowing to NIS's refineries again. But there is still no sign of a gas deal – and the extent of the damage to Serbian-Russian relations may be significant.Vucic often insists that Serbia's path leads towards the European Union. If nothing else, this episode may strengthen that conviction.",

    "body": "How the Japan PM's Taiwan remarks provoked the fury of China13 hours agoKoh EweEPA/ShutterstockJapanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Japan could respond with its self-defence force if China attacked TaiwanOver the past week, China and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words.It all started when Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested that if China attacked Taiwan then Japan could respond with its own self-defence force.Since then, foreign ministries on both sides have lodged serious protests with the other, and a Chinese diplomat made what some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of Taiwan.Here's what to know.What happened? A timelineThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.A \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.Takaichi's remarks drew ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".On Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".While the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.Tokyo has lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing has lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.On Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful commenting on specific scenarios from now on.A long history of animosityThere is a longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.Historical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, Shinzo Abe's protege, suggests more tensions may lie ahead.The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.Getty ImagesThe US and Japan have been deliberately ambiguous on how they would respond, should China invade TaiwanTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.Why Takaichi's recent comments caused such a stirThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.This is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\"",

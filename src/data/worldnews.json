    "body": "'The answer cannot be nothing': The battle over Canada's mystery brain disease52 minutes agoJoel Gunter,senior international reporter, New BrunswickandNadine Yousif,senior Canada reporter, New BrunswickBBCFive hundred people in a small Canadian province were diagnosed with a mystery brain disease. What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?In early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. \"I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he recalled. \"And an image of a cluster became more clear.\"Many of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a \"house of cards\".To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was \"degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause\". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated,\" said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. \"There's all these different levels.\"Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called \"original 48\".Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.\"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps,\" Lucas recalled. \"We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions.\"Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.Jillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. \"He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important,\" Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was \"the only one listening to them,\" said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.\"He's an incredible human and physician,\" said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.\"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough,\" Nicholson said. \"But he was such a pillar of support.\"In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.\"It's like reading a movie script,\" emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.\"We are all in the movie!\", a senior federal scientist replied.Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. \"I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.And the mystery disease got a name: the \"New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause\". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it \"one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen\".\"We all owe you a debt of gratitude,\" he wrote.But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling \"flabbergasted\" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a \"diarrhea of symptoms\".Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.\"All available evidence and logic\" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.\"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not.\"The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was \"not expected to pose risks\" to human health or the environment.)According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. \"I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100.\"By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full \"boots-on-the-ground\" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. \"Everybody received that email like a cold shower,\" he said.None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.\"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking,\" Lanteigne said. \"Full stop.\"Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.A protest sign in New Brunswick. Some residents are angry about pesticide use in the province. (Chris Donovan/BBC)But the government had decided against examining any of the patients in person, an omission that outraged those who believed they were part of the cluster. The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. \"He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'.\"Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.\"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that.\"Marrero declined to discuss it. \"Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment.\"In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. \"Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations,\" wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. \"When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum,\" Lucas said. \"And I choose him.\"Jillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)She wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, \"What now?\"Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.\"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email,\" said Lucas. \"He just has so many patients.\"As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.\"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that,\" Strickland said.Kevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog. His partner April was diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. \"I think I waited four months for that letter,\" Strickland recalled. \"I kept phoning and asking.\"Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero \"did nothing for April,\" Strickland said. \"I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients,\" he said.Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she recalled. \"Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time.\"But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. \"Those were the words he used,\" she said.Sandi Partridge in a park near her home. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms with a psychological root. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero. \"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND,\" Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. \"And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me,\" she said. \"I hit every single marker.\"Partridge is now on a multi-faceted FND treatment programme involving neurology, neuropsychology and occupational health. And she is at peace with her diagnosis. \"The stigma is difficult,\" she said, \"but I've accepted it.\"Gabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path.Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she \"just needed to find a boyfriend\", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.Gabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. \"I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.\"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet,\" stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. \"He told her that she wasn't alone.\"There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.\"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,\" said her father Andre, angrily.Global NewsGabrielle Cormier, in her wheelchair, with other patients calling for suppport. Jillian Lucas is far left. (Global News)The call pushed the Quigley-Cormier family away from Lang and his FND diagnosis and back towards Marrero, who the family had come to believe in deeply. Marrero had never crossed \"any kind of line,\" Stacie said. \"He's pristine.\"\"That's why all his patients like him,\" Andre said. \"Love him, maybe.\"Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.\"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said.\"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that.\"Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people \"co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda\".Dr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)The cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.\"They are trying to present me as it,\" he said, dejectedly. \"I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed.\"Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. \"As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly,\" he said. \"But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts.\"Dr Marrero in his home office. \"I was part of it, but I was not it,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. \"Lives hang in the balance,\" read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. \"It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,\" the letter said. \"Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.\"The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. \"I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,\" she said.Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.\"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,\" Lang said.\"I would even go further,\" Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. \"I would say they are being abused.\"Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.\"It has to be a patient complaint,\" they said. \"And all his patients love him.\"The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. \"She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom,\" her stepmother said. \"It's a very limited life.\"Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero \"deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people.\" But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. \"The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care,\" he said.Jillian Lucas in her back garden. \"I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became \"choked up\", she said. \"It eats him up, he's fighting back tears.\"And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he \"took the utmost care to abide by\" the laws around Maid and had \"never proposed it\" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control. \"I have a limit in my mind of how far I can go,\" she said.Sitting in his garden office, the sun streaming in, Marrero had no such limits in mind. \"I keep going because I know,\" he said, confidently. He had been able to meet \"with some of the best scientists in the country,\" he said. He had more than 500 cluster patients now, and every week the number was going up.",

    "body": "Trump's grand plan to reshape the world order leaves Europe with a difficult choice to make1 day agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCFor 80 years, what bound the United States to Europe was a shared commitment to defence and a common set of values: a commitment to defend democracy, human rights and the rule of law.That era was inaugurated in March 1947 in an 18-minute speech by President Harry Truman, in which he pledged US support to defend Europe against further expansion by the Soviet Union.America led the creation of Nato, the World Bank, the IMF and the United Nations. And it bound itself into what became known as the \"rules-based international order\", in which nation states committed to a series of mutual obligations and shared burdens, designed to defend the democratic world against hostile authoritarian powers.Now, the new US National Security Strategy (NSS), published in December, signals that, for the White House, that shared endeavour has ended; that much of what the world has taken for granted about America's role is over.The review refers to the \"so-called 'rules-based international order'\", putting the latter phrase in inverted commas: a kind of delegitimisation by punctuation mark.AFP via Getty ImagesJD Vance said that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within Vice-President JD Vance warned America's European allies that this was coming in a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025.He told them bluntly that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within - from those censoring free speech, suppressing political opposition and therefore undermining European democracy. And he was damning about the \"leftist liberal network\".The French newspaper Le Monde said the speech was a declaration of \"ideological war\" against Europe.Last month's NSS codifies Vance's remarks, and, in black and white, elevates them to the status of doctrine.\"Certainly America is no longer the country that promoted the global values that have been in place since the end of the Second World War,\" says Karin von Hippel, who previously held senior positions in the US State Department and is a former Director of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank.\"It is shifting to a very different place.\"So, if the world is indeed moving away from that order, what is it moving towards? And what does it mean for the rest of the world and in particular for Europe?'We have a different world today'\"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment, and have not served our or any other particular purpose,\" says Victoria Coates, a vice-president at The Heritage Foundation, a prominent right-wing think tank in Washington.In the eyes of Coates - who was previously the Deputy National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump - change to the international order is inevitable in a changing world.\"The other issue we face here is that when that so-called rules-based international order was established after the Second World War, 80 short years ago, China wasn't a major concern.\"We just have a different world today.\"Getty ImagesPresident Truman watches on as a US representative signs the United Nations Charter in 1945This rules-based international order, built in the years after World War Two, was created by a generation that had come of age during an era of Great Power geopolitics, and had seen that system descend, twice, into catastrophic global conflict.That international order, flawed and incomplete though it undoubtedly was, was the legacy of that experience.But the NSS directly argues that American strategy went astray in the years since - and it blames what it calls \"American foreign policy elites\".\"They lashed American policy to a network of international institutions, some of which are driven by outright anti-Americanism and many by a transnationalism that explicitly seeks to dissolve individual state sovereignty,\" it says.It suggests that in future, the US will seek to roll back the influence of supranational bodies. Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe National Security Strategy says: 'We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations'\"The world's fundamental political unit is and will remain the nation-state… We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations…\"Elsewhere in the document, reflecting on the \"balance of power\", it states: \"The outsized influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of international relations.\"The Kremlin responded to the review with praise, saying much of it aligned with Moscow's own thinking.\"I think Trump, Xi, Putin and their more authoritarian acolytes are seeking to return us to an era of Great Power politics,\" says Field Marshal Lord Richards, who, as General Sir David Richards, was the head of the UK's armed forces from 2010 till 2013.Yet Sir Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King's College London, believes the new Security Strategy is not as radical a break with the past as it may appear.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Kremlin said much of the review aligned with Moscow's own thinking\"We need to be careful about the rules-based international order, which is a term that came into general use in the last decade or so,\" he argues.\"Look back and you find plenty of violations of the rules, Vietnam for example. So there's a sort of rosy glow about the past at times and everyone should be careful about nostalgia for what was a complex past.\"Muscular reassertion of the Monroe doctrineWashington's military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas that led to the capture of the country's leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, is an early example of this more muscular assertion of sovereign unilateralism.Some international law experts have questioned the legality of the Trump administration's actions, and argued the US may have violated international statutes governing the use of force. The US maintains its actions were legally justified.\"Under American law it certainly was [legal]\" Robert Wilkie, who served as an Undersecretary of Defense in the first Trump administration, has previously told the BBC.\"Maduro - most of our European partners have not recognised his regime so he is an illegitimate figure. Because of that he is stripped of the normal protections that heads of state would have [...]particularly when were are looking at constitutional provisions that exist in the United States, that would supersede anything the UN says.\"AFP via Getty ImagesThe military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas led to the capture of Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia FloresThe NSS claims, for the United States, the right to be the pre-eminent power in the Western Hemisphere, and to bend its Latin American and Caribbean neighbours into alignment with Washington's interests.This is a muscular reassertion of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and its promise of US supremacy in the Western hemisphere.Colombia, Panama and Cuba are all also in the President's sights.\"This starts primarily with the Panama Canal,\" says Victoria Coates. \"The degree to which control of the canal is necessary to the United States cannot be overstated.\"China is now Latin America's biggest trading partner and a major infrastructure investor there. The NSS aims to roll back Chinese influence in Washington's backyard.When the canal was handed over to Panama in 1999, says Coates, \"we were in the assumption that China was a reasonable actor… That turned out not to be true…\"So making sure that the United States retains a prime position over the canal is critical, and I think Panama is for the first time getting that message from the United States.\"But Sir Lawrence Freedman is among those who argue that the US's ability to control its neighbours is not unlimited.\"The Strategy Review might say this is our hemisphere and we can do what we want, but there are still constraints. They may have extricated Maduro and his wife, but they're still dealing with the old regime.\"They're not running the country, despite what Trump says.\"Under the new strategy, the United States will no longer pressure authoritarian regimes to improve their human rights records.In a phrase taken from the US Declaration of Independence of 1776, the review declares, \"All nations are entitled by 'the laws of nature and nature's God' to a 'separate and equal station' with respect to one another.\"Getty ImagesXi Jinping and Nicolas Maduro pictured in 2015 in Beijing, ChinaIn the Middle East, for example, the US says it will abandon the \"misguided experiment with hectoring these nations - especially the Gulf monarchies - into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government\".\"The key to successful relations with the Middle East,\" it adds, \"is accepting the region, its leaders, and its nations as they are while working together on areas of common interest.\"But it seems the same level of respect for traditions and historic forms of government is not extended to the democratic and allied nations of Europe.Whilst it refers to an American sentimental attachment to the European continent - and to Britain and Ireland - what's striking about this paper is that it seeks to redefine what is worth defending in the Western world.This review is civilisational in its reach, and argues for a civilisation that is no longer built on the shared values of the Truman Doctrine, but instead on the primacy of the sovereign nation-state.Where does this leave Europe?The review is damning about Europe's \"current trajectory\" and raises questions about whether some European nations can be regarded as dependable allies in the future.It talks about \"economic decline\" but adds that this is \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure\".Elsewhere in the document, it states: \"It is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European,\" which raises doubts about their viability as long-term security partners, the strategy suggests.\"It's a very nativist document,\" argues Karin von Hippel. \"It's very ideological. The underlying message is that the Christian white male is no longer running many of the countries [in the West] and we're seeing a threat to the dominance that the Christian white male has had in the United States and Europe.\"They're very careful not to say any of that explicitly but I think that's what's implied.\"Getty ImagesThe new US National Security Strategy, which was published in December, is damning about Europe's 'current trajectory'But Victoria Coates argues that, in her view, the \"larger struggle we find ourselves in\" is indeed civilisational.\"Sovereignty is also a critical issue,\" she says. \"Looking at the European Union project, especially after Brexit, I think a lot of countries are wondering if subverting the national interest to Brussels is a winning strategy.\"I do think that is one of the institutions that the NSS does call into question.\"This chimes with the interests of the American tech giants that oppose EU efforts to regulate their activities on the European continent.Last month Elon Musk posted on X that the European Union should be abolished and sovereignty returned to the individual nation states.'Cultivating resistance to Europe's trajectory'The review is clear about how Europe can regain its \"self-confidence\".It says: \"The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism. Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory. We will need a strong Europe to help us successfully compete.\"And one of its policies for doing this is by \"cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".What is meant precisely by \"cultivating resistance\" raises many questions.In Europe, some have already concluded that the USA may no longer be a reliable ally, at a time when Russia poses a growing threat. After Vice-President Vance's speech in Munich, Germany's Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" from America with a reshaped Nato.But this takes time.\"It's not achievable in the short term,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Europeans have become very dependent upon the United States, and this was a matter of choice: it was cheaper and simpler.\"Though in practice it would be desirable to be able to act without the Americans… in practice it's going to take years to disentangle ourselves. And it'll be extremely expensive.\"So Europe has a difficulty: it can't rely on the Americans, but it can't operate easily without them.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFriedrich Merz has said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" As to the pressing question of what it means for Europe - and the EU - in the near future, Lord Richards issues a stark warning: \"[It] risks falling between the cracks.\"\"The EU cannot be a Great Power, nor can any of its constituent nations,\" he argues. \"[So] the UK/EU must decide under whose sphere of influence they should shelter?\"The answer is they are likely to remain in the USA's - and within a reshaped Nato.\"'A popular revolt against the establishment'But Lord Richards also believes that increased spending commitment is long overdue.\"European nations are going to have to spend much more on their own defence. This has long been coming but in the UK it is not yet translating into any fresh money. Indeed this year the armed forces are being required to save money rather than spend more.\"The US has been pushing Europe to increase defence spending for years, notes Sir Lawrence.\"The message that Europe needs to do more for its own defence has been around a long time. It was pushed by both Obama and Biden.\"Last year Trump secured from the European allies a commitment to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP - and in doing so may have done Europe a security favour, by pushing it, in the long term, towards greater operational independence from Washington.\"Spending has gone up quite significantly,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Germans have been making quite impressive strides. So there is movement, not as fast as many would wish, but it's happening.\"The review is clear about how America thinks it can \"help\" Europe. \"We want to work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness,\" it says.Getty ImagesVictoria Coates says: \"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment...\"Ultimately, what the report reveals is not so much an ideological divide that separates the US and Europe, but one that slices through both continents.Both sides of the Atlantic have certain concerns in common, argues Victor Mallet, a Paris-based journalist and author of a forthcoming book, Far Right France: Le Pen, Bardella and the Future of Europe.\"Concerns about immigration, concerns about the economy… and there's an extraordinary cultural gulf between supporters of people like Donald Trump, the National Rally in France, the AfD in Germany, and the intellectual, metropolitan, educated liberal elite.\"It's definitely a popular revolt against the establishment.\"He believes that one of the problems is inequality. \"America has, on average, the richest group of consumers the world has ever seen and yet many ordinary Americans find it hard to make ends meet and the same applies in Western Europe.\"More from InDepthIn the NSS, the US commits to scrapping certain practices, such as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, that are derided by many in Trump's base.In this document, the culture wars that shape America's bitter public discourse now to a degree also shape its in foreign policy, and - by extension, affect the security of the Western world.Russia is not mentioned as a hostile power, despite its invasion of Ukraine, a Western ally. For in the culture wars, some in Trump's Maga base see in Vladimir Putin not a foe but a natural ally in the defence of white, Christian nationalist civilisation: a man who proudly defends his country, its traditions and identity - the very attributes, after all, that they value and admire in Donald Trump.Update: This article was updated to remove an incorrect reference to President George HW Bush having handed over the Panama Canal.Top picture credit: AFP / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Conditions for emergency services working at the site were challenging, the mayor added, with unstable debris posing a hazard and crew waiting for better equipment to arrive.The privately-owned Binaliw landfill collapsed on Thursday while 110 workers were on site, officials said.Archival said in a Facebook post on Saturday morning: \"Authorities confirmed the presence of detected signs of life in specific areas, requiring continued careful excavation and the deployment of a more advanced 50-ton crane.\"Relatives of those missing have been waiting anxiously for any news of their whereabouts. More than 30 people, all workers at the landfill, are thought to be missing.\"We are just hoping that we can get someone alive... We are racing against time, that's why our deployment is 24/7,\" Cebu City councillor Dave Tumulak, chairman of the city's disaster council, told news agency AFP.AFP via Getty ImagesRelatives of the missing are waiting anxiously for any news of their loved onesJerahmey Espinoza, whose husband is missing, told news agency Reuters at the site on Saturday: \"They haven't seen him or located him ever since the disaster happened. We're still hopeful that he's alive.\"The cause of the collapse remains unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera previously said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices.Operators had been cutting into the mountain, digging the soil out and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman on Friday.The Binaliw landfill covers an area of about 15 hectares (37 acres).Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "The US and its partner forces have carried out large-scale strikes against Islamic State (IS) group targets in Syria, the US Central Command (Centcom) has announced. US President Donald Trump directed the strikes on Saturday, which are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, in retaliation to the IS group's deadly attack on US forces in Syria on 13 December, Centcom wrote on X.The strikes were conducted in an effort to combat terrorism and protect US and partner forces in the region, according to Centcom. \"Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,\" Centcom said. The US and its partner forces fired more than 90 precision munitions at more than 35 targets in an operation that involved more than 20 aircraft, an official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.The official added that aircraft including F-15Es, A-10s, AC-130Js, MQ-9s and Jordanian F-16s had taken part in the strikes. The location of the strikes and the extent of any casualties is not yet clear.\"We will never forget, and never relent,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X on Saturday in reference to the military action.  The Trump administration first announced Operation Hawkeye Strike in December after an IS gunman killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter in an ambush in Palmyra, located in the centre of Syria.\"This is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance,\" Hegseth said when announcing the operation in December. \"The United States of America, under President Trump's leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people.\"Prior to the latest strikes on Saturday, US forces killed or captured nearly 25 IS group members in 11 missions between 20 December and 29 December as part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, Centcom said. In the operation's first mission on 19 December, US and Jordanian forces carried out a \"massive strike\" against the IS group, deploying fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery to strike \"more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\", according to Centcom. That operation, it said, \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.",

    "body": "A rare copy of the 1938 comic that introduced Superman to the world has sold to an anonymous collector for $15m (£11.2m).The private sale of the Action Comics No 1 copy - once stolen from actor Nicolas Cage's home and returned to him over a decade later - was announced on Friday.The previous record for the sale of a comic book was set in November, when a pristine Superman No 1 fetched $9.12m at auction. Both sales far exceed the original 10-cent price tags - or around $2.25 in today's money.Superman's debut is one of several tales anthologised in Action Comics No 1, which is widely credited with having defined the superhero genre as we now know it. Fewer than 100 copies are thought to exist.Friday's Action Comics sale was negotiated by New York-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said both the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.The broker said the copy had been graded nine out of a possible 10 points by the Certified Guaranty Company, which specialises in authenticating collectables - making it the joint-highest scoring copy of the comic to date.The broker said its value was further inflated by its storied association with Hollywood star CageThe Con Air and National Treasure star purchased this particular copy in 1996 for $150,000 - a record at the time.But the comic was stolen during a party at Cage's home in 2000 and only found - inside a storage unit in California - in 2011.\"During that 11-year period, it skyrocketed in value. The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it,\" said Metropolis/ComicConnect CEO Stephen Fishler.Cage was reunited with the copy and, six months later, sold it at auction for $2.2m.Fishler compared the comic's history to the brazen theft of Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911, which transformed the then little-known work to the world's most famous painting.\"The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon - and that's what Action No 1 is. An icon of American pop culture.\"",

    "body": "A mountain of rubbish collapsed at a landfill in the central Philippines on Thursday, killing a 22-year-old woman and leaving more than 30 people missing, authorities have said.Rescuers pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from debris at the Binaliw Landfill in Cebu City, who were later hospitalised.Many of the missing are believed to be workers at the landfill. The mayor of Cebu told news outlet ABS-CBN that it may be difficult to reach survivors because of the potential for further collapse. The cause of the collapse is still unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices. Some 300 people from various government agencies and civilian groups have been deployed to the privately-owned landfill. Several excavators, ambulances and fire trucks have also been seen on site.\"All response teams remain fully engaged in search and retrieval efforts to locate the remaining missing persons,\" Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Friday.\"This is not like other landslides that you can just excavate. If you pull from the top, the bottom is soft. Let's say there is a person there, when you get the debris, it might get worse,\" he said, ABS-CBN reported.Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said the incident may have happened suddenly, but was likely a result of poor waste management practices.Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman.\"It's not a sanitary landfill. It's already an open dumpsite,\" he said.Families are waiting for updates on their loved ones trapped in the debris.One Binaliw resident, Belen Antigua, told Rappler that her son had survived the landslide but she was still waiting for her other relatives to be found. Another said that families had been gathered at the landfill to look for their children since Friday morning.\"I could not understand my emotions. They said those trapped are calling for help, so there is a possibility that my brother is still there,\" Michelle Lumapas, whose brother works at the landfill, told ABS-CBN.The Binaliw landfill is about 15 hectares (37 acres).Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "description": "The family of Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has accused a hospital of negligence over the death of her 21-month-old son.Nkanu Nnamdi died",
    "body": "The family of Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has accused a hospital of negligence over the death of her 21-month-old son.Nkanu Nnamdi died at a hospital in Nigeria on Wednesday following a short illness, leaving the family of the acclaimed postcolonial feminist writer \"devastated\".Now, the family allege there was a litany of failures at Euracare Hospital in Lagos that led to the toddler's death, including being denied oxygen and being given too much sedation, causing a heart attack.The hospital expressed its \"deepest sympathies\" over the loss of the child but denied improper care, which it said had been in line with international standards.It added that Nkanu had arrived at the hospital \"critically ill\" and that an investigation into the death was now under way.Adichie's sister-in-law, Dr Anthea Nwandu, made a series of allegations about the hospital in an interview with Nigerian broadcaster Arise TV on Saturday.In it, she said the medical director of Euracare had told Adichie her son \"had received too much sedation\", which subsequently caused him to have a heart attack.Dr Nwandu also accused medical staff of leaving the child unattended, denying him oxygen and transporting him in a manner that was \"not according to standard practice\".She alleged Nkanu suffered a brain injury due to lack of oxygen.Similar accusations concerning Nkanu's care were made in a private message from Adichie that was leaked online. Her spokeswoman Omawumi Ogbe told the BBC that the message had originally been shared within \"a close circle of family and friends\", and \"was not for public consumption\".Ms Ogbe continued: \"While we are saddened that such a deeply personal account of grief and trauma was leaked, the details therein highlight the devastating clinical failures the family is now forced to confront.\"We hope that the substance of that message, detailing the gross medical negligence that led to this tragedy remains the central focus even as we look forward to the truth and accountability.\"Nkanu was one of twin boys Adichie shared with her husband, Dr Ivara Esege.Responding to the allegations, Euracare Hospital acknowledged the \"profound and unimaginable loss\" the family was experiencing, but said in a statement on Saturday that \"reports currently being circulated contain inaccuracies\".It said Nkanu, who was critically ill, had been referred to the hospital after receiving treatment from two paediatric centres, and that upon arrival staff \"immediately provided care in line with established clinical protocols and internationally accepted medical standards, including the administration of sedation\".It continued: \"In the course of his care, we worked collaboratively with external medical teams as recommended by his family and ensured that all necessary clinical support was provided.\"However, \"despite these concerted efforts\", the boy died less than 24 hours after arriving at the hospital, it added.A \"detailed investigation\" was under way, Euracare said, adding that it remained \"committed to engaging transparently and responsibly with all clinical and regulatory processes\".Adichie, 48, had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Her twin boys were born using a surrogate in 2024.The award-winning US-based writer is known for works including Half of a Yellow Sun, Americanah and her 2012 Ted Talk and essay We Should All Be Feminists, which was sampled by Beyoncé on her 2013 song Flawless.Nigeria's president was among those to have expressed their condolences over the death of Nkanu.The African nation's health system has suffered of late from a severe shortage of doctors, leaving healthcare staff working long hours and doctors juggling jobs in both public and private hospitals.Responding to the allegations concerning Nkanu, Lagos state Ministry of Health spokeswoman Dr Kemi Ogunyemi said it \"places the highest value on human life and maintains zero tolerance for medical negligence or unprofessional conduct\".She confirmed the state's health watchdog had commenced a \"thorough, indepedent and transparent\" investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death.\"Any individual or institution found culpable of negligence, professional misconduct, or regulatory violations will face the full wrath of the law,\" Dr Ogunyemi said.She urged members of the public to avoid speculation over the death while the official investigation was ongoing.",

    "body": "US forces have seized another tanker in the Caribbean Sea, officials say, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to control exports of Venezuelan oil. The tanker, the Olina, is on multiple countries' sanctions lists and the fifth vessel to be seized by the US in recent weeks.The US is using the seizures to pressure Venezuela's interim government and remove the so-called dark fleet of tankers from service.  Officials say this fleet consists of more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned and illicit oil.\"Once again, our joint interagency forces sent a clear message this morning: 'there is no safe haven for criminals,'\" said the US military's Southern Command on Friday.The vessel reportedly left Venezuelan waters late on Sunday, after the US seized  President Nicolás Maduro in an early morning raid.Officials said Friday's operation was carried out before dawn by Marines and sailors in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, and that it was seized after it \"departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces\".  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that it was \"another 'ghost fleet' tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil\".Noem also shared a video appearing to show troops dropping onto a ship from a helicopter, and described the operation as \"safe\" and \"effective\".Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech said the vessel was attempting to break through the US naval blockade in the Caribbean. It had been sailing under a false flag registered to Timor-Leste, according to the International Maritime Organization.Vanguard Tech added that the vessel's location tracker was last active 52 days ago, northeast of Curacao, and that \"the seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region\".The US had sanctioned the Olina last January, then named Minerva M, accusing it of helping finance Russia's war in Ukraine by moving Russian oil to foreign markets.Earlier this week, the US said it seized two other tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in \"back-to-back\" operations in the North Atlantic and Caribbean.One of them was the Russian-flagged Marinera seized with the help of the UK Royal Navy, which gave logistical support by air and sea.The Marinera is allegedly part of shadow fleet carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions. US officials said that Marinera was falsely flying the flag of Guyana last month, which made it stateless.US authorities alleged the second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was \"conducting illicit activities\".Experts have told BBC Verify that under UN international maritime law, authorities can board a stateless vessel.President Donald Trump  says Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US.The oil, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would be sold \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\".Meanwhile on Friday, US diplomats visited the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to assess the possibility of re-opening an embassy in the Latin American country. Diplomatic ties between the US and Venezuela were severed by Maduro in 2019. The new Venezuelan authorities have said they're engaged in exploratory talks on restoring relations.",

    "body": "Elon Musk has said critics of his social media site X are looking for \"any excuse for censorship\", after its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok drew criticism over its use to create sexualised images of people without their knowledge or consent.Ofcom says it is conducting an urgent assessment of X in response, with the backing of Technology Secretary Liz Kendall.But the chairwomen of Parliament's technology and media committees have both said they are concerned that \"gaps\" in the Online Safety Act might hinder the media regulator's ability to deal with the matter.X has now limited the use of AI image function to those who pay a monthly fee, a change dubbed by Downing Street as \"insulting\" to victims of sexual violence.The BBC has seen several examples of the free AI tool undressing women and putting them in sexual situations without their consent.Kendall said on Friday that she expects an update from Ofcom within days, and that it would have the government's full support should it decide to block X in the UK.Musk reposted a number of messages on the site overnight criticising the government's reproval of Grok - including one which showed AI-generated images of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a bikini.\"They just want to suppress free speech,\" Musk wrote.Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk's children, told BBC Newshour on Friday that Grok had generated sexualised photos of her as a child. The conservative influencer said her image had been \"stripped\" to appear \"basically nude, bent over\", despite her telling Grok that she did not consent to the sexualised images.St Clair, who filed a lawsuit against Musk in 2025 seeking sole custody of their child, accused the social media site of \"not taking enough action\" to tackle illegal content, including child sexual abuse imagery. \"This could be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" she said.As of Friday morning, Grok was telling users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\", adding users \"can subscribe to unlock these features\".An Ofcom spokesperson said on Friday: \"We urgently made contact [with X] on Monday and set a firm deadline of today to explain themselves, to which we have received a response.\"We're now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency and will provide further updates shortly.\"Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping X raise money or be accessed in the UK - should the firm refuse to comply.But Dame Chi Onwurah, chairwoman of the innovation and technology committee, said she was \"concerned and confused\" about how the matter is \"actually being addressed\", and has written to Ofcom and Kendall for clarification.Dame Chi said it was \"unclear\" under the Online Safety Act whether the creation of such images using AI was illegal, as was the responsibility of social media sites for what was shared on their platforms.\"The act should really make something so harmful to so many people clearly illegal, and X's responsibility should be clear,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Caroline Dinenage, chairwoman of the culture, media and sport committee, likewise said she had a \"real fear that there is a gap in the regulation\".\"There are doubts as to whether the Online Safety Act actually has the power to regulate functionality - that means generative AI's ability to nudify someone's image,\" she told BBC Breakfast.The use of Grok to generate non-consensual sexualised images has been condemned by politicians on all sides: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called it \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said it was \"horrible in every way\" and that X \"needs to go further\" than the changes it had made to Grok on Friday, but he added that banning the platform would be an attack on free speech The Liberal Democrats called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site was investigated.Elsewhere, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he agreed with Starmer that the material was \"completely abhorrent\".\"It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility,\" Albanese said, adding that Australia's digital safety commissioner was looking at the situation.\"Australians and indeed, global citizens deserve better.\"Meanwhile, Grok was temporarily suspended in Indonesia on Saturday. The country's digital minister said \"non-consensual sexual deepfakes [were] a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the security of citizens in the digital space\".",

    "body": "1 day agoLucy HookerandRachel Clun,business reportersThe EU has reached a free trade agreement with South American countries, 25 years after talks began and despite opposition from farmers in several European countries.The deal with the Mercosur trading bloc - which includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay - will require the approval of the European parliament within the next few monthsBrazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hailed it as a \"historic day for multilateralism\" after the four South American countries put the final touches to the deal in Brussels.It comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on countries around the world and his recent military intervention in Venezuela.The EU heralded what will be its largest free trade accord to date as a \"win-win\", although critics have argued that cheap imports may undercut European farmers in products including beef, poultry and sugar. \"In an international scenario of growing protectionism and unilateralism, the agreement is a signal in favour of international trade as a driver of economic growth, with benefits for both blocs,\" President Lula posted on X.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the deal will \"bring meaningful benefits to consumers and businesses, on both sides\".Farmers in several countries in Europe held last-ditch protests against the deal, with marches and demonstrations using tractors in France and Belgium.\"There is a lot of pain,\" Judy Peeters, a representative for a Belgian young farmers' group, told AFP at a protest on a motorway south of Brussels. \"There is a lot of anger.\"Von der Leyen said the Commission had listened to the concerns of farmers, and had acted on them including through introducing \"robust safeguards\" to protect their livelihoods in the agreement.As well as boosting trade and political ties, the European Commission said the deal would help fight climate change, through commitments to halt deforestation and ensure a \"reliable\" flow of raw materials, critical for the global green transition.The Commission expects the deal to save local companies €4bn ($4.7bn, £3.5bn) a year in export duties.South American countries boast deposits of gold, copper and some of the critical minerals required for renewable and battery technology.Cecilia Malmström, a former European commissioner for trade who led EU trade negotiations for five years, told World Business Express on BBC World Service that parts of the trade agreement could be suspended if Mercosur countries failed to stick to their commitments around environmental protection.\"[This agreement] is also a very strong geopolitical signal today to other powers who do not appreciate rule-based trade in the same way as we do,\" she said.On Friday afternoon a broad majority of EU member states confirmed their support for the free trade agreement, but it will still require approval from the European Parliament before it can take effect.Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief Euro-zone economist for Capital Economics, said voting was expected to be close in the parliament.However, he said the larger issue was how much of an impact the deal would have, and pointed to the Commission's own estimate that it would raise EU economic output by just 0.05%.\"The bigger point though is that even if the agreement is eventually implemented, it will be macroeconomically insignificant,\" he said.\"And because it will be phased in over 15 years, these benefits won't arrive until 2040 at the earliest.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAt least 29 people have been arrested in Minneapolis during protests over the death of a woman who was shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent.One police officer was also injured after a \"chunk of ice was thrown at them\", city officials said, during demonstrations which saw 1,000 people take to the streets of the city on Friday night.Protests against immigration enforcement have been held across the US after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot in her car on Wednesday. The Trump administration said the agent who fired the shots acted in self-defence. Local officials have insisted the woman posed no danger.Minneapolis Police declared an unlawful assembly on Friday night as protesters gathered outside the Canopy Hotel in the city, where some ICE agents were believed to be staying.The Minneapolis police department said in a statement that \"some individuals forced entry into the hotel through an alley entrance\". Videos posted online showed protesters flashing bright lights into the area, blowing whistles and banging on drums. Police said there were \"well over 1,000\" demonstrators in the area and some threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, police vehicles and other vehicles, but no serious injuries were reported.One law enforcement officer suffered minor injuries but did not need any medical attention, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.Watch: Video filmed by ICE agent who shot Minneapolis woman has emergedOfficials said another hotel in the city was also targeted and had window and graffiti damage.At a news conference on Saturday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey applauded the majority of protesters who he said have been peaceful, but noted that individuals who cause damage to property or put others in harm's way would be arrested.The 29 people arrested on Friday night were later released, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.O'Hara said that by 01:00 local time (07:00 GMT), the crowd had been dispersed, and his officers deployed a \"disciplined and restrained response\".Many Minnesotans have been frustrated by the presence of ICE in the state and  O'Hara said his department was getting dozens of phone calls every day about the federal agency's operations.On Saturday, three congresswomen from Minnesota also attempted to tour an ICE facility in Minneapolis. The women said they were initially allowed to enter, but were then told they had to leave. Democratic Congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig said ICE  and the Department of Homeland Security were obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.\"They do not care that they are violating federal law,\" Craig said.\"The public deserves to know what is taking place in ICE facilities,\" Omar posted on X.Further protests are planned in Minneapolis this weekend, as well as in Texas, Florida, Washington DC and elsewhere in the US, according to Indivisible, an organisation that formed to resist the Trump administration. An earlier video shows the incident from another perspectiveGood was shot and killed in her car on Wednesday. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and telling the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents at the front of the car points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard.The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street.Good's wife told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours.The officer who fired on Good is Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent who was previously injured in the line of duty when he was struck by a car.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed the ICE agent shot Good multiple times because she was trying to run over the officer in her car.But Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Frey called that version of events a false narrative, saying it was clear to him she was trying to leave the scene, not attack an agent.The FBI is investigating the incident. On Friday, Minnesota officials said they would open an inquiry into the shooting after saying they had been frozen out of the federal investigation.The announcement came a day after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI had initially pledged a joint investigation, then reversed course. The US vice-president said the investigation was a federal issue.",

    "body": "Russia has used the Oreshnik ballistic missile as part of a massive overnight strike on Ukraine.Four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions.It is only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024.Russia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack targeting Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out.While the ministry did not specify what had been the Oreshnik's target, shortly before midnight (22:00 GMT) videos began circulating on social media showing numerous explosions on the outskirts of the western city of Lviv.President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a ballistic missile had struck infrastructure in Lviv, about 60km (40 miles) from the Polish border.The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles). It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart.\"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's residence in December. The EU had immediately cast serious doubt on whether the drone strike ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place.On Friday EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia's Oreshnik strike was meant as a warning to Europe and the US. \"Putin doesn't want peace, Russia's reply to diplomacy is more missiles and destruction. This deadly pattern of recurring major Russian strikes will repeat itself until we help Ukraine break it,\" she wrote on X.Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik, 13 ballistic missiles targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones.One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added.He accused the attacks of aiming \"against the normal life of ordinary people\" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity.As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv.A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a \"double-tap\" hit - in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured.Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted.The morning after, as the clean-up got underway, the businesses that hadn't been damaged were open. A coffee shop just a few floors down from a destroyed apartment was serving customers. Wreckage from a Russian drone, including its wings and engine, were still scattered over the pavement outside.At another site, the round, charred entry hole of a missile was visible on the 11th floor of an apartment block in a quiet residential area.The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend.On Friday Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to leave temporarily if they were able to, and find warmth. \"Half of Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - are currently without heat due to damage to the capital's critical infrastructure caused by a massive enemy attack,\" he wrote on social media.Kyiv's streets now relentless hum with the buzz of the diesel generators that businesses rely on for power, but many residential buildings are reliant on central heating and restoring it can be a longer task.The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating.On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems. ",

    "body": "22 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern Europe correspondent in Crans-Montana'In this shared grief we stand united': Day of mourning for New Year's Eve fire victims in SwitzerlandTragedy brought people together in Crans-Montana and brought the country to a standstill.On Friday, just down the road from the bar where 40 young people were killed by fire on New Year's Eve, church bells rang in their memory.They tolled right across Switzerland, to mark a national day of mourning.Then, moments after the last notes of a special memorial service had faded, came the news that one of the bar's owners had been detained.Many of the victims' families had demanded action like this from the start: more than a week after the fire, the anger in this community has been increasing.At the main ceremony in Martigny, down in the valley, relatives of the dead were joined by survivors. Some had come from hospital for the memorial. People held white roses in their laps and gripped each other's hands for support.\"The images we faced were unbearable. A scene worse than a nightmare. Screams ringing out in the icy cold, the smell of burning. It was apocalyptic,\" a young woman called Marie told the audience. She had been in a bar opposite Le Constellation when the fire broke out and suddenly found herself helping the injured as they ran from the flames.She said she would never forget what she'd seen.Listening in the front row were the presidents of France and Italy, whose citizens were among those killed and injured in the fire. Both countries have opened their own investigations.Back in Rome, Italy's prime minister vowed to make sure all those responsible were identified.\"This was no accident. It was the result of too many people who did not do their jobs,\" Giorgia Meloni said. She wants to know why the music wasn't cut as soon as the fire started.\"Why did no-one tell the young people to get out? Why did the council not make the proper checks? There are too many whys.\"In Crans-Montana people have the same questions and many more.For now, the only two formal suspects are the co-owners of Le Constellation, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. Early on Friday, the pair were called in by prosecutors.  They are being investigated for causing death and injury through negligence but have not been charged. Now Jacques Moretti has been remanded in custody. In a statement, the public ministry said the move followed a \"new assessment of the flight risk.\"\"I constantly think of the victims and of the people who are struggling,\" his wife told a crush of TV cameras after several hours of questioning at the ministry.It was her first public comment since the fire.\"It is an unimaginable tragedy. It happened in our establishment, and I would like to apologise.\"Nine days on, Le Constellation is still obscured from view behind white plastic sheets. A lone policeman stands guard, his face covered against the relentless snow.What unfolded inside the building's basement has gradually become clearer – and it's the story of a disaster that should never have happened.Mobile phone footage shows a sparkler tied to a champagne bottle apparently starting the fire as it brushes the ceiling. Covered with soundproofing foam that was never safety tested, it ignites quickly.When the crowd eventually rush for the exit in panic, there is a crush on the stairs. It seems the emergency doors were blocked.But another video, from six years ago, suggests the risk was well known. On the footage, a waiter can be heard warning that the material on the ceiling is flammable.\"Be careful with the foam,\" the voice shouts, as people wave the same sparklers.But the questions here are not just for the owners.This week the local authorities in Crans made the shocking admission that they hadn't carried out mandatory safety checks of the bar for five years.They offered no explanation.\"It was a hell inside that bar. More than 1,000 degrees of temperature. There was no way to escape,\" Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told the BBC, citing a long list of safety violations.  Six Italians were killed as a result.\"Italy wants justice, the Italian government wants justice and the Italian people want justice, for sure. The families want justice,\" the ambassador stressed.That includes for those with life-changing injuries.The regional hospital in Sion took the first major influx of patients. The stress was compounded by the fact that many doctors' own children were partying in Crans for the New Year.\"They were all scared the next stretcher to arrive would be carrying their own child,\" hospital director Eric Bonvin remembers.But he's proud of how his team coped.Some casualties were unconscious and so badly burned, it took time to identify them.The most serious cases were moved to specialist burns centres elsewhere in Switzerland and in Europe where some are still in a critical condition.All face a long, tough path to recovery which the doctor likens to a \"rebirth\" because many of his young patients have severe burns to the face.\"First the body needs to be protected, like the foetus in a mother's womb. That's what's happening for many now. Then they will have to re-enter the world and find their identity,\" Professor Bonvin says.\"It will take a lot of work and resilience.\"Add to that the anguish of surviving.\"They came round and at first they felt lucky to be alive. But some now feel this guilt, wondering why they are here, but not their friend or brother,\" Bonvin explains.\"It is a delicate moment.\"In central Crans, the heap of tributes for the dead is still growing, protected from the elements by a canvas.After leaving their own fresh flowers on Friday, many people then stood in front of the ruins of the bar itself for a moment. Remembering, in silence.",

    "body": "24 hours agoSarah SmithNorth America editorWatch: BBC asks Trump why US owning Greenland is importantPresident Donald Trump says the US needs to \"own\" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so.\"Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland,\" Trump told reporters on Friday, in response to a question from the BBC.The US will do it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\", he added. The White House recently said the administration was considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force.Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale. Denmark has said military action would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance.Greenland's party leaders, including the opposition, reiterated their call for the \"US's disregard for our country to end\" in a joint statement on Friday night.\"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" they said. \"The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\"Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US president has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\".The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But Trump told reporters in Washington that a lease agreement was not good enough.\"Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals,\" he said, adding that they had to have ownership. \"I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.\"And by the way, Nato's got to understand that.\"Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that \"only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations\".Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Greenlander on Trump takeover threats: 'It makes me feel sick to my stomach'Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week.In recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.",

    "body": "US film stars Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors become Guinea citizens after DNA tests12 hours agoMakuochi OkaforBBC AfricaMohamed Finando / Oxygen AfricaHusband and wife movie stars Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have travelled to Guinea, where they have been granted citizenship after tracing their ancestry to the West African nation through DNA testing.Majors, a star of Creed and Ant-Man, said becoming citizens would allow the couple to \"bridg[e] the gap\" and bring together their stories as entertainers and members of the African diaspora.\"We just want to say thank you so much,\" added Good, best known for the film Think Like a Man, who said it was her first visit to Guinea.Their citizenship ceremony was similar to other initiatives in the region to encourage people of African descent to reclaim their heritage and invest in the continent.The event - a private cultural ceremony organised by the ministry of culture - took place at a tourist and cultural centre, Gbassi Kolo, on Friday.Djiba Diakité, minister and chief of staff of the presidency, presented the passports to the two actors on behalf of President Mamadi Doumbouya.\"We both believe that you are among the worthy sons and daughters of Guinea to represent our country and the red and green flag throughout the world,\" he said.Guests were treated to a series of traditional dance and music performances, including on the djembe - a drum that draws many foreigners to Guinea to learn its rhythms.Asked about what their long-terms plans were in Guinea, the couple told the BBC by email: \"We could absolutely see ourselves having a home here and spending meaningful time in Guinea. \"This is not a fleeting connection - it's something we see as long-term and evolving.\"Good, 44, and Majors, 36, began dating in May 2023 and tied the knot last year.They married following a turbulent period in Majors' life. In 2024, he was sentenced in the US to probation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend, British choreographer Grace Jabbari. He was mandated to complete a 52-week domestic violence intervention programme.The actors landed at Conakry's Gbessia International Airport in the early hours of Friday morning and were welcomed with great fanfare by officials and musicians.During their stay in Guinea, the pair are scheduled to tour Boké, a coastal region with historic slave trade sites. It is unclear if they plan to invest in or move to Guinea.Mohamed Finando / Oxygen AfricaAhead of the ceremony, the stars were presented with kola nuts - a culturally symbolic gift of welcomeIn recent years, several celebrities have taken up citizenships of countries in Africa.It largely began in 2019, when Ghana launched \"The Year of Return\", inviting those with African heritage to come home and invest. One of the most prominent stars to do so was Stevie Wonder in 2024.Other notable examples have been US singer Ciara, who took Beninese citizenship last year, and Hollywood actor Samuel L Jackson, who acquired a Gabonese passport in 2020.Guinea itself has a long history of welcoming activists and people from the African diaspora.In the 1960s, South African singer Miriam Makeba and her husband, US civil rights activist and Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael, moved to Guinea.Makeba had been made stateless for her opposition to apartheid and after her marriage to Carmichael, who popularised the slogan \"black power\", her US visa was revoked.She was treated as an honorary Guinean citizen and cultural ambassador, while Carmichael, who took the name Kwame Ture, remained in Guinea even after their divorce, dying there in 1998.Guinea has experience political turmoil in recent years - and under the junta that seized power in 2021 the country has become less open to dissent. Coup leader Gen Mamady Doumbouya restricted the media and suppressed protests.The country has recently returned to civilian rule following elections last month, won by Doumbouya with 87% of the vote. Unlike other countries in the region that have experienced recent coups, Guinea has maintained relations with Western governments, particularly France.The country is rich in minerals, including bauxite, iron ore, diamonds, gold and uranium, yet its people remain among the poorest in West Africa.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

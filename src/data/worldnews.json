    "body": "<div><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges by a grand jury. </p><p>James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. </p><p>Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. </p><p>In a statement, James accused the president - who recently publicly pressured prosecutors to file criminal charges against her - of a \"desperate weaponization of our justice system\".</p></div><div><p>\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general,\" she said. </p><p>\"These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.\"</p><p>The US prosecutor assigned to the case, Lindsey Halligan, meanwhile, said the case proved that \"no one is above the law\". </p><p>\"The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" she said. </p><p>\"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump's only goal is \"political retribution\" - Letitia James responds to indictment</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Trump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.</p><p>James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.</p><p>The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home. </p><p>The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead \"used as a rental investment property\", which was being rented to a family of three.</p><p>The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.</p><p>Halligan said that, if convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison per count and up to a $1 million (Â£751,755) fine on each count.</p><p>James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said: \"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"</p><p>Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. </p><p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.</p><p>James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress.</p><p>The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.</p><p>In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (Â£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. </p><p>During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a \"political witch hunt\" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law\". </p><p>James on Thursday said she stands behind her office's litigation against Trump and his organisation. </p><p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said James's indictment \"is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable.\"</p><p>The New York Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union called it \"the latest in a long list of brazen abuses of power by President Trump\".</p></div>",

One of the main targets of these controls appears to be overseas defence manufacturers, including those in the US, who rely on rare earths from China.</p><p>China had added several rare earths and related material to its export control list in April, as the trade war with Washington ramped up, which caused a major global shortage.</p><p>But the new announcement makes clear that licences are unlikely to be issued to arms manufacturers and certain companies in the chip industry.</p><p>Even the technology used to mine and process rare earths, or to make magnets from rare earths, can only be exported with permission from the government, the Commerce Ministry said. </p><p>Chinese firms are also banned from working with foreign companies on rare earths without government permission.</p><p>The latest announcement also clarifies the specific technologies and processes that are restricted.</p><p>These include mining, smelting and separation, magnetic material manufacturing, and recycling rare earths from other resources.</p><p>The assembly, debugging, maintenance, repair, and upgrading of production equipment are also prohibited from export without permission, the announcement added.</p><p>This could have a major impact in the US, which has a significant rare earths mining industry but lacks processing facilities.</p></div><div><p>The new regulations create Beijing's version of US rules which block countries from selling chip-making equipment to China.</p><p>The US has used those measures to slow China's development of powerful chips that could be used for artificial intelligence (AI) with military applications.</p><p>Trade expert Alex Capri believes China's new regulations \"are specifically timed\" ahead of Xi and Trump's expected meeting later this month.</p><p>Beijing has targeted key vulnerabilities in US electronics and weapons manufacturing, mirroring America's earlier moves against China's chip industry, he added.</p></div><div><p>Rare earths are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.</p><p>Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.</p><p>Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like neodymium, yttrium and europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.</p><p>For instance, neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, electric car motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.</p><p>China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.</p><p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-66cdf862-5e96-4e6e-90b8-a407b597c8d9\">The price of the rare earth metals the world buys from China</a></li></ul><p><i>Additional reporting by Ian Tang of BBC Monitoring</i></p></div>",

With only 18 months before the end of Macron's presidency, he also warned that anyone joining his government would have to put on hold their presidential ambitions. </p><p>What makes it even harder for Lecornu is that he will face a vote of confidence in a National Assembly where Macron has no majority to support him. The president's popularity hit a record low this week, according to an Elabe poll that put his approval rating on 14%.</p><p>Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally, which was not invited to Macron's talks with party leaders on Friday, said that Lecornu's reappointment was a \"bad joke\", from a president \"more than ever isolated and disconnected at the Ã‰lysÃ©e\".</p><p>Bardella said his party would immediately bring a vote of no confidence against a doomed coalition, whose only reason for being was fear of an election. National Rally is currently leading in the polls.</p></div><div><p>Lecornu at least knows the pitfalls ahead as he tries to form a government, because he has already spent two days this week talking to parties that might take part.</p><p>He was first appointed prime minister on 9 September and took the next three weeks to put together a government, only for it to fall apart overnight when the the leader of the conservative Republicans, Bruno Retailleau, criticised one of the ministerial appointments.</p><p>By themselves the centrist parties cannot form a government, and there are splits within the conservative Republicans who have helped prop up Macron's governments since he lost his majority in elections last year. </p><p>Retailleau, who is known to have presidential ambitions, has made clear he will not be part of Lecornu II, and has declared the <i>socle commun</i> (common platform) of centrists and conservatives as dead. Not all his party colleagues agree.</p><p>But it means the centrist prime minister is also looking to left-wing parties for potential support.</p><p>In an attempt to court the left, Macron's team indicated the president was considering a delay to part of his highly contentious pension reforms passed in 2023 which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images National secretary of French left-wing Greens party Marine Tondelier (L) and President of Ecologiste et Social parliamentary group Cyrielle Chatelain speak to the press after a meeting with the French President at the Elysee Palace,\" /><span>AFP via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Marine Tondelier (L) of the Greens said she saw no reason not to bring a vote of no confidence in a Lecornu government </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>That risks angering key centrist allies, who fought hard to get pension reforms through.

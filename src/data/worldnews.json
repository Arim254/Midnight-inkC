This includes products like milk, yogurt and cheese. </p><p>Oat milk, for instance, is called an oat drink on European shelves.</p><p>Greens and liberal lawmakers have criticised the now-approved EP text as \"useless\". </p><p>\"While the world is burning, the EPP has nothing better to do this week than to involve us all in a debate about sausages and schnitzel,\"  Anna Cavazzini of Germany's Green Party was quoted by Deutsche Welle as saying. </p><p>Environmentalists have said that the ban would be a setback for sustainability. </p><p>The proposal has also drawn criticism from key food industry voices in Germany - the largest market for plant-based products  in the EU, according to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gfieurope.org/european-plant-based-sales-data/#spain\">report by the Good Food Institute of Europe. </a></p><p>Major German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, fast food joint Burger King and sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1or1KNtCSQrP1zFD4-3xAQAWR8Tbwi0OA/view\">have pushed back against the proposal in a joint open letter</a>. </p><p>They said banning \"familiar terms\" would make it \"more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions\". </p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz - whose party is a key member of the EPP - fully backs the ban. \"A sausage is a sausage. Sausage is not vegan,\" he said recently.</p><p>The French meat industry has also strongly supported the idea. </p><p>Back in 2020, a similar proposal was on the table but it wasn't passed.</p></div>",

Because I have to go out for a meeting,\" he added.</p></div><div><p>Professor Kitagawa works at Kyoto University in Japan, Professor Richard Robson is at University of Melbourne, Australia, and Professor Omar M Yaghi is at the University of California, US. </p><p>The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000).</p><p>The scientists' work is about how molecules can be built together into structures - or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The Nobel committee called it \"molecular architecture\".</p><p>The men worked out how to build constructions with large spaces between the molecules, through which gases and other chemicals can flow. </p><p>These \"rooms\" can be used to capture and store chemicals that humans want to get rid of, including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or so-called forever chemicals, also known as PFAS.</p><p>The scientists began working independently on the structures in the 1970s and 1980s. Prof Robson asked his university to drill holes into the lab worktops so that wooden balls - representing atoms - could be attached to wooden rods, representing chemical bonds.</p><p>So far MOFs have only been used on a small-scale, but companies are looking into whether they can be mass-produced.</p><p>One potential application is to break down harmful gases, including those used in nuclear weapons. </p><p>Companies are also testing whether they can be used to capture the planet-warming gas carbon dioxide from power stations and factories.</p><p>Professor Robson, who was born in North Yorkshire but has been based at the University of Melbourne since 1966, told BBC Newshour that the news \"wasn't a big surprise [because of] all sorts of sounds I've been hearing over the years\".</p><p>When asked about the potential applications of his work he urged caution:  \"There's talk about binding CO2 and solving the world's atmospheric problems, which don't sound realistic to me - but these sorts of compounds could do that sort of job on a small scale\".</p><p>The 88-year-old professor admits the prize money \"is the main thing actually in my head. It wasn't the driving force for all of this but at this stage in my life that's a very nice thought to have\".</p><p>The award is another indicator of the value of chemistry in addressing some of the planet's hardest problems.</p><p>\"Every year we see Nobel Prizes given to chemists who welcome the challenge of finding solutions to the biggest problems our global society faces – better healthcare, environmental protection, clean energy, and secure food and water for everyone,\" said Dr Annette Doherty, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry in Britain.</p></div><div><p>The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p>Professor Kitagawa was motivated by the principle of \"the usefulness of useless\", according to the Nobel committee. It reflected the philosophy of an ancient Chinese philosopher, Zhuangzi, who said that even if something did not bring immediate benefit, it could still turn out to be valuable.</p><p>Professor Yaghi was born in Amman, Jordan and raised in a single room with his siblings without electricity or running water, according to the Nobel committee.</p><p>He became captivated by molecular structures one day at school, and aged 15, he went to the US to study.</p><p>It is the third science prize awarded this week. On Tuesday John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis won the Physics Nobel for their work on quantum mechanics that paved the way for the quantum computer.</p><p>On Monday three scientists' work on how the immune system attacks hostile infections won them the prize for medicine.</p></div>",

The organisation said they were detained some time ago but it was not previously reported.</p><p>Security Minister Mahamadou Sana said the NGO had \"collected and passed on sensitive security information that could be detrimental to national security and the interests of Burkina Faso, to foreign powers\".</p><p>The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO), which provides safety information to aid workers, has \"categorically\" denied the allegations.</p></div><div><p>Anthony Neal,  a representative of the NGO told the BBC's Newsday programme that its Burkina Faso country director had been detained since July when the organisation was suspended. The seven others were arrested later.</p><p>\"We continue to work towards their safe and immediate release,\" he said.</p><p>The NGO was suspended on 31 July for three months by the authorities for \"collecting sensitive data without authorisation\". It has been working in the country since 2019.</p><p>On Tuesday, the security minister said that despite being banned, members of the organisation had continued to secretly collect information and hold meetings.</p><p>Mr Neal denied the claim, saying its information-collection activities had ceased on 31 July but its staff remained in Burkina Faso to deal with the detention and meet its contractual commitments.</p><p>A statement by the  organisation emphasised that the information it collects was not confidential and was meant for the safety of humanitarian workers.</p><p>It added that the Burkinabé authorities were \"fully aware\" of their work and mandate and had been co-operating with the authorities.</p><p>Mr Neal said he had tried to engage with the government to address any misunderstandings or concerns. He said safety information was critical, with a \"record\" number of aid workers having been killed this year around the world.</p><p>Burkina Faso's military government led by Capt Ibrahim Traore seized power in a coup three years ago, and has had a frosty relationship with Western nations ever since.</p><p>In response to a worsening Islamist insurgency, the junta stopped working with the former colonial power, France, and instead turned to Russia for military assistance.</p><p>Human rights groups have since accused the army of committing abuses against civilians while tackling the militants, and also cracking down on political dissent and freedom of expression.</p></div>",

Almost all of them have been deported, with six reportedly still in detention.</p></div><div><p>Organisers of the new attempt initially said three of its boats had been intercepted in the early hours of Wednesday morning, 120 nautical miles off the coast of Gaza.</p><p>Within hours, a live tracker showed that all nine boats had been stopped.</p><p>\"The vessels and the passengers are transferred to an Israeli port. All the passengers are safe and in good health,\" the Israeli government said.</p><p>\"The passengers are expected to be deported promptly.\"</p><p>The 150 passengers hail from a wide range of countries, including Turkey whose foreign ministry called the intervention \"a grave violation of international law\" and \"an act of piracy\".</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 67,183 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.</p><p>Israel has maintained a naval blockade off the coast of Gaza since 2007, when Hamas took control of the Strip.</p><p>Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 460 Palestinians have died from the effects of malnutrition since the start of the war, including 182 since the declaration of a famine in Gaza City, which has been at the centre of an Israeli military campaign in recent weeks.</p><p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which is backed by the United Nations, confirmed there was a famine in Gaza City and warned that it could spread within weeks.</p><p>Israel disputes the IPC's findings.

    "body": "<div><p>French President Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister within 48 hours, the Elysee Palace has said, fending off speculation that fresh elections could be imminent.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, outgoing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu said the possibility of dissolving parliament was beginning to fade following talks with political parties over the last two days.</p><p>\"There is a majority in parliament and that is the majority that is keen to avoid fresh elections,\" he said.</p><p>On Monday, Lecornu - a close ally of Macron - became the third French PM to leave his job in less than a year, driven out by a hung parliament deeply divided along ideological lines.</p></div><div><p>He was then asked by Macron to stay on for two days to form a consensus among parties on how to get out of the current political crisis.</p><p>In a much-awaited TV interview on Wednesday evening, Lecornu gave no indication about who the next prime minister would be, and although he said his mission was \"finished\", he also did not appear to rule himself out entirely.</p><p>He said that as well as not wanting fresh elections, most MPs also recognised the pressing need to pass a budget by the end of the year.</p><p>However, he recognised the path towards forming a government was still complicated due to the divisions within parliament and to politicians eyeing the next presidential election.</p><p>Whoever ends up in government \"will need to be completely disconnected from any presidential ambition for 2027,\" said Lecornu, a former armed forces minister.</p><p>France's political stalemate began following snap elections in July 2024. Since then no one party has had a majority, making it difficult to pass any laws or reforms including the yearly budget.</p><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt, which this year stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.</p><p>Previous prime ministers Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou were ousted in confidence votes after they presented austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu said his own draft budget would be presented next week, although it would be \"open for debate\".</p><p>\"But the debate needs to begin... parties cannot say they'll vote it down without examining it,\" he added.</p><p>Similarly, Lecornu said, one big issue that has been plaguing French politics since 2023 will need to be revisited - Macron's highly contested pension reforms. \"We have to find a way for the debate to take place,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>But some factions in parliament appear immovable from their positions.</p><p>Mathilde Panot of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) said soon after Lecornu's TV interview that the only solution was \"the resignation and departure of Emmanuel Macron\".</p><p>Meanwhile, far right National Rally's leader Marine Le Pen, who has long been calling for fresh elections, stated on Wednesday that she would vote down any new government.</p><p>It is unclear, at this stage, which political forces would support a new government.</p><p>The so-called common platform of centrists and Republicans that have run the government since last year appears to have fallen apart.</p><p>The big question now is whether over the last 48 hours Lecornu was able to persuade the Socialists, who were part of that left bloc during the elections, to prop up a government in some way.</p><p>Asked about the calls by some political factions for Macron to resign, with even Macron's own former prime minister Edouard Philippe floating the idea earlier this week, Lecornu said France needed a stable, internationally recognised figure at its helm.</p><p>\"This is not the time to change the president,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>However, Macron is appearing increasingly isolated, with even close allies beginning to distance themselves from him.</p><p>Earlier this week Gabriel Attal, widely seen as Macron's protégé, said he \"no longer understood\" Macron and called for the appointment of an independent negotiator to steer the government.</p><p>Macron has not yet spoken publicly since Lecornu's shock resignation on Monday morning. Lecornu promised the president would \"address the French people in due course,\" without specifying when that may be.</p></div>",

It also called for the release of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically-elected leader who was deposed in the coup and jailed. </p><p>The Sagaing region has been a key battleground in the war, with large parts of it under the control of volunteer militias.</p><p>These groups, known as the People's Defence Force (PDF), also run the local administration. An official in the local PDF told BBC Burmese that they had received information about a potential airborne attack during Monday's gathering.</p><p>They tried to end the protest quickly, but the paramotors - as paragliders are known locally - reached the scene earlier than expected, he said.</p><p>It all happened in seven minutes, he said. He says the explosion injured his leg, but some people near him were killed. </p><p>Locals said it was hard to identify the bodies in the aftermath.</p><p>\"Children were completely torn apart,\" another woman who had helped to organise the event told AFP news agency. She was not at the scene but attended funerals on Tuesday, and added that they were still \"collecting body parts\".</p></div><div><p>In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International said that the junta's use of motorised paragliders to attack communities was part of a \"disturbing trend\". </p><p>BBC Burmese recently reported that the junta were increasingly opting for paramotors amid a lack of aircraft and helicopters, as well as jet fuel. </p><p>International sanctions over the past few years have made it harder for Myanmar's rulers to procure military equipment - though the recent influx of technology from countries like China and Russia seems to have helped turned the tide. </p><p>Joe Freeman, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher, said the attack \"should serve as a gruesome wake-up call that civilians in Myanmar need urgent protection\".</p><p>He also called on Asean, the South East Asian regional bloc due to convene later this month, to \"increase pressure on the junta and revise an approach that has failed the Myanmar people for almost five years\".</p><p>Myanmar is scheduled to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3pp4n952o\">hold general elections in December</a>, the first vote since the 2021 coup. Critics, however, say the vote will not be free and fair and is aimed at trying to legitimise military rule. Many opposition parties have been banned, and voting is likely to take place in only about half the country, in the areas the military controls.</p></div>",

However, relations between them have since soured, with access to the Red Sea becoming a major flashpoint. </p><p>In the letter seen by AFP news agency, Gedion alleged that Eritrea and a hardline faction of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) were \"funding, mobilizing and directing armed groups\" in Ethiopia's Amhara region, where militiamen known as Fano have been battling the federal government. </p><p>\"The hardliner faction of the TPLF and the Eritrean government are actively preparing to wage war against Ethiopia,\" AFP quoted the letter as saying. </p><p>BBC Amharic has contacted the Ethiopian foreign ministry to confirm the authenticity of the letter, but it has not yet responded. The letter is widely circulating on social media among Ethiopian government supporters.</p><p>A TPLF faction, led by Debretsion Gebremichael, controls the government in Ethiopia's Tigray region, which borders Eritrea. </p><p>It accuses Abiy's government of failing to fully implement a peace deal reached in 2022 to end conflict in Tigray, and says another TPLF faction, led by Getachew Reda, is colluding with Addis Ababa. </p><p>Eritrea fought on the side of the Ethiopian army in the conflict, but was not part of the deal and is now accused of forming an alliance with the Debretsion-led TPLF faction. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq8ywlk8n4yo\">'No-one can handle another war' - Tigrayans fear fresh Ethiopian conflict</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c15wz4l5pddo\">Joyful Ethiopians and Eritreans embrace at rare border reopening</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyv7e6mr2gpo\">'I lost my leg on the way home from school'</a></li></ul><p>At the same time, Ethiopia has been hit by an increasingly brutal conflict in its Amhara region, after the Fano militias - previously allied with Abiy's government against the TPLF - rejected moves to disarm them and said they were defending the Amhara ethnic group from government atrocities. </p><p>The Fano appear to be expanding their agenda to topple Abiy's government, and are  carrying out more deadly operations. </p><p>Ethiopia's privately owned Addis Standard newspaper reported that the foreign minister's letter accused Eritrea and TPLF hardliners of supporting Fano's efforts to capture the town of Woldiya in the Amhara region in September.</p><p>TPLF commanders and fighters participated directly in the operation, the newspaper quoted the letter as saying. </p><p>The minister said Eritrea was attempting to destabilise Ethiopia as it felt threatened by Addis Ababa's bid to gain access to the Red Sea, the newspaper reported.</p><p>Since October 2023, landlocked Ethiopia has been pushing for renewed access to the Red Sea, arguing that it had erred in relinquishing control of ports to Eritrea at the time of its independence. </p><p>In Ethiopia's parliament on Monday, President Taye Atske Selassie described the Red Sea and River Nile as \"great water resources, which are essential to our country's existence\".</p><p>This led to a sharp rebuke from Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel, who dismissed the rhetoric as \"too crass and pathetic to sell\".</p><p>He added that the Ethiopian ruling party's \"obsession\" with the Red Sea and River Nile was \"bizarre and mind-boggling by all standards\". </p></div>",

Legal cases have recently been filed in Illinois and Oregon.</p><p>As the legal battles continue, here's what to know.</p></div><p></p><h2>What is the National Guard and who oversees it?</h2><p></p><div><p>The National Guard consists of primarily state-based troops that typically respond to major issues like natural disasters or large protests.</p><p>All 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands have their own contingent of National Guard troops. Those troops also can be deployed abroad, and some units specialise in fighting wildfires or securing the US border.</p><p>Guard members ultimately report to the Department of Defence, and can be federalised - or brought under the control of the president - under certain circumstances. However, requests for its support normally start at a state level. </p><p>In those circumstances, the governor of a state activates guard troops during an emergency, and can request additional help from the president or other states.</p><p>National Guard troops have limited power. They do not enforce the law, or make arrests, seizures, or searches. A law called the Posse Comitatus Act limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p></div><p></p><h2>How is Trump trying to use the National Guard in US cities?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump has tried to circumvent the normal process for deploying the National Guard several times now - including with his efforts to order guard members from one state into a different state.</p><p>In June, he took control of the California National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, even though Governor Gavin Newsom objected. </p><p>California filed two cases against the Trump administration. One of these challenged Trump's seizure of the National Guard, but an appeals court ultimately ruled in favour of the president. In a second case, a federal judge found that Trump's use of the guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act.</p><p>Over the summer, hundreds of National Guard troops were sent into Washington DC, to respond to what Trump called a \"situation of complete and total lawlessness\". The president cited homelessness and crime rates as justification.</p><p>Trump has now authorised the deployment of 300 guard members to Chicago following immigration protests, particularly outside detention facilities. Officers who were sent from Texas have now arrived at a training centre near Chicago.</p><p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has alleged Trump is trying to \"manufacture a crisis\", and has filed a legal case of his own.</p><p>Trump also attempted to deploy National Guard members from other states to Portland, in Oregon, before a federal judge temporarily blocked him.</p></div><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">Trump authorises deployment of 300 National Guard to Chicago</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yenwklgdyo\">'I sleep with a gas mask on': Life next to Portland protest angering Trump</a></li></ul></div><p></p><h2>What legal basis does Trump use to deploy the National Guard?</h2><p></p><div><p>A little-known provision of US military law governs the president's authority to deploy the National Guard on his own. Until now, presidents have rarely used it.</p><p>American law allows the president to call National Guard troops from any state into service if the US is \"invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation\", or \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the US government.</p><p>Trump invoked this law to bring 2,000 National Guard troops under his control in June in order to support raids led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><p>Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also cited the law in a memo deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service on 28 September.</p><p>\"We're very confident in the president's legal authority to do this,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on 6 October. \"And we're very confident we will win on the merits of the law.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>Why does Trump want to use the National Guard in Portland?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump is again seeking to use the National Guard to respond to demonstrations, after protests near an ICE building in Portland in early October. </p><p>Federal officers, including with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border Patrol agency (CBP), clashed with demonstrators who opposed Trump's mass deportation initiative.</p><p>Trump has claimed the city is \"burning down,\" but Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said \"there is no insurrection in Portland, no threat to national security.\"</p><p>The Trump administration has moved to send 200 California National Guard troops to neighbouring Oregon to respond to the protests. But US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, has temporarily blocked this.</p><p>On Saturday, Judge Immergut blocked Trump from federalising the Oregon National Guard. \"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" she wrote in her ruling. The next day, she issued a temporary restraining order against Trump deploying California's National Guard in Portland instead. </p><p>The Trump administration is expected to appeal.</p></div></article>",

For the third time in a year his choice of prime minister has resigned, and opinion polls suggest almost three-quarters of voters think the president should step down too.</p><p>Macron has repeatedly said he will not leave office early, and France is now waiting to find out if a new government can be formed, or if he has to dissolve parliament.</p></div><p></p><h2>How did we get here?</h2><p></p><div><p>Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu announced his resignation at the start of a day of political drama on Monday, after only 26 days in the job.</p><p>Hours later he said he had accepted Macron's request to stay on for another 48 hours - until the end of Wednesday - to hold last-ditch talks with political parties \"for the stability of the country\".</p><p>The unexpected twists were the latest in a long series of upheavals that began with Emmanuel Macron's decision to call a snap parliamentary election in June 2024. The result was a hung parliament in which Macron's centrist partners lost their majority and had to seek alliances with other parties.</p><p>The leader of one of those parties, Bruno Retailleau of the conservative Republicans, pulled out of Lecornu's government 14 hours after it was announced.</p></div><p></p><h2>It's all about France's debt</h2><p></p><div><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt and get over the ideological divisions between the centre-ground parties who could be part of a government.</p><p>Early this year public debt stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy. France's budget deficit this year is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.</p><p>Michel Barnier and François Bayrou lasted only three and nine months respectively before being ousted in confidence votes as they tried to tackle the deficit with austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu did not even make it as far as presenting a budget plan. Criticism poured in from all sides as soon as he presented his cabinet on Sunday afternoon and by Monday morning he had decided his position was untenable.</p><p>He blamed his departure on the unmovable stance of parties who, he said, \"all behave as if they had a majority\".</p><p>All the parties have an eye on the next presidential votes in 2027, and they are also gearing up for the possibility of snap parliamentary elections in case Macron dissolves parliament again.</p></div><p></p><h2>What happens now?</h2><p></p><div><p>Lecornu has been deep in discussions with party representatives and has until Wednesday evening to present a \"platform of action and stability\" to Macron.</p><p>There are four options - and none of them look good.</p></div><div><ul><li>If Lecornu manages to persuade the centre-ground parties to form some kind of government, then Macron will be able to name a new prime minister, whoever that is. Lecornu has indicated he does not wish to take on the job.  He said on Wednesday that there was a \"willingness\" among the parties to have a budget in place by 31 December and that this will clearly helped \"distance\" the threat of dissolving parliament. One option he has is to offer the job to the Socialists, if Macron is prepared to suspend hard-fought reforms that raised the pension age in France from 62 to 64. But that would cost France billions and the next government needs to pass some kind of 2026 budget to tackle its national debt, and bring down the budget deficit.</li><li>If Lecornu fails, the Elysee has indicated that Macron would \"take responsibility\". That would probably mean fresh parliamentary elections, which would spell bad news for his centrist allies and the Socialists but would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular. Elections would need to take place a maximum of 40 days after parliament is dissolved - which would mean voting in November.</li><li>Macron's presidency ends in 18 months but he is facing increasing calls to step down. He has repeatedly rejected early presidential elections, but it is not out of the question. Former Macron minister Benjamin Haddad argues that his resignation would make no sense  as the next president would just face the same problem: \"The political divide is here to stay.\"</li><li>Even without a government agreement, the parties could put aside their differences in parliament and come to a compromise on a limited budget. But French politics is not known for its culture of compromise.</li></ul></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A smiling Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella walk down the street\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>A snap election would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular</figcaption><p></p></figure><p></p><h2>Who are the key figures in this crisis?</h2><p></p><div><p>The leaders who have been calling on Macron to resign for months are on the hard right and radical left.</p><p>Marine Le Pen and her young lieutenant in the far-right National Rally, Jordan Bardella, are ready for elections and have refused Lecornu's invitation to talk.</p><p>Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) has been agitating for Macron's impeachment, although that seems unlikely.

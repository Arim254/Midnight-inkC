    "body": "Four Chinese officials have been dismissed over a fireworks display in the Himalayas last month by outdoor apparel brand Arc'teryx that drew heated criticism. Videos of brightly coloured fireworks that apparently resembled a \"rising dragon\" erupting over a lush Tibetan landscape had sparked environmental concerns and a boycott campaign.  Arc'teryx and the Chinese pyrotechnics artist Cai Guo-Qiang, who designed the show, later apologised.Authorities in Tibet's Shigatse city said in a statement on Wednesday that more officials had been investigated and given warnings. They added that Arc'teryx and Cai have to provide compensation and help \"restore the environment\". Authorities said the fireworks, which lasted for nearly a minute and affected around 30 hectares (74 acres) of grassland, have caused limited short-term damage but said further monitoring was needed to assess \"ecological risks\".\"The incident created fireworks remnants, plastic debris and other things that were not thoroughly cleaned,\" the statement added.\"The instantaneous bright light and loud noise produced by the fireworks caused short-term disturbance to wild animals.\"The four officials who have been sacked include Gyantse county's Communist Party secretary, public security chief and two senior members of county and city-level environmental agencies.The artist who orchestrated the display, Cai, is best-known for his role behind fireworks for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He has said he would work with authorities in Tibet to help with the area's recovery.Social media users, who said the stunt ran counter to Arc'teryx's conservation-focused image, had called for a boycott of the brand.Arc'teryx was founded in 1989 and has more than 150 shops worldwide. It is now owned by a Hong Kong-listed fitness equipment company Anta Sports.The firm claimed the display had been aimed to promote local mountain culture, but said in its apology that it was \"out of line with Arc'teryx's values\". It also said it had used biodegradable materials and would work with an external agency to assess the project's impact.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAbhishek DeyBBC News, GuwahatiIndia's goods exports to the US, its largest foreign market, dropped sharply by 20% in September and nearly 40% in the last four months, as Trump's steep tariffs took effect, data shows. September was the first full month of Washington's 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which kicked in on 27 August. This includes a 25% penalty for Delhi's refusal to stop buying oil from Russia. \"US has become India's most severely affected market since the tariff escalation began,\" said Ajay Srivastava of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.Negotiations for a trade deal between the two countries are under way, with the goal of concluding an agreement by next month.According to GTRI, the most significant impact of the tariffs has been felt by labour-heavy sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, and chemicals, which have suffered the heaviest losses. Shipments to the US have seen four consecutive months of decline, and are down 37.5% - from $8.8bn (£6.5bn) in May to $5.5bn in September. The drop in exports have also contributed to India's trade deficit (the gap between what a country imports and exports), which widened to a 13-month high of $32.15 billion in September. Some of the reduction in exports to the US was cushioned by improved trade with countries like the UAE and China. Trade negotiations between India and the US resumed last month after months of stalling over a number of differences. An Indian delegation is currently in the US for  talks.On Wednesday, Trump said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil, as the US seeks to put economic pressure on the Kremlin as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine. A spokesperson of the Indian foreign ministry said discussions were \"ongoing\" with the US administration which had \"shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India\".But major sticking points over trade still remain, including access to agriculture and dairy. For years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and the interests of millions of small farmers.Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil, as the US seeks to put economic pressure on the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine.Trump told reporters he had received assurances from Modi that India would halt its purchases \"within a short period of time\", which he called \"a big stop\".The US president has sought to leverage India's purchases of Russian oil in his trade war, but Delhi has so far resisted.Reacting to the Trump remarks, an Indian government spokesman said discussions were \"ongoing\" with the US administration which had \"shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India\".\"Our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective,\" the spokesman said.Oil and gas are Russia's biggest exports, and Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey.\"Now I've got to get China to do the same thing,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, as part of his administration's broader push to cut off Moscow's energy funding.In response, a Chinese government spokesman, said it had \"normal, legitimate economic, trade, and energy co-operation with countries around the world, including Russia\".The Kremlin said Russia could provide good quality oil at a lower price. An official said that, if countries were prevented from buying Russian crude, \"then the principles of free trade are being violated\".The Trump administration also wants Japan to stop importing oil and gas from Russia, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he communicated this \"expectation\" to visiting Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato on Wednesday.India cannot \"immediately\" halt oil shipments, Trump said, adding that the shift will be \"a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon\".The Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India, levies that Trump has characterised as punishment against Delhi for buying Russian oil and weapons. The tariffs – which took effect in August and are among the highest in the world – include a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for its war in Ukraine.Modi has for months stood his ground, arguing that India is neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war despite his country's ties with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Indian officials have called the Trump administration's accusations that Delhi profits from Russia's war in Ukraine a double standard, citing ongoing trade with Russia in the US and Europe.India relies on Russian crude oil, which Delhi has continued to buy at a discount, to support its economy - the fifth largest in the world.The dispute over Russian oil has strained the relationship between Trump and Modi, although the US president on Wednesday praised the Indian leader as a \"great man\". Modi said last week that he spoke with Trump and that they \"reviewed good progress achieved in trade negotiations\".",

    "body": "10 minutes agoWycliffe MuiaNairobi andBasillioh RukangaNairobiHuge crowds of mourners have turned out to receive the body of Kenya's former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, a day after he died in India, in a public outpouring of grief that forced a brief suspension of operations at the country's main airport.Thousands of mourners carrying twigs and palm branches breached security at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in the capital, Nairobi, immediately after the body arrived on Thursday morning. The authorities said mourners had gained access to restricted areas, prompting a \"precautionary closure\".The airport later said operations had been restored following the shutdown, which lasted about two hours.From the airport, thousands people moved in a procession to escort the vehicle carrying the body into central Nairobi.Because of the unexpectedly large crowds, the public viewing ceremony for his body has been moved to Nairobi's Moi International Sports Centre, rather than inside the parliament building. The body has arrived at the stadium, where crowds are already inside, with more people outside.Obituary: A founding father of Kenya's multi-party democracyHow Odinga's court challenges have improved Kenya's electionsHuge crowds had earlier gathered at Lee Funeral Home where the body was first expected, and around parliament. \"I came here at  six in the morning. We have been at the airport to welcome Baba [Odinga's nickname],\" one mourner had told the BBC near the airport.\"We are sad, we have been left as orphans. He is our father.\"Motorcycle rider William Otieno Adoyo said he was a \"Baba die-hard\".\"We want to see Baba, how do we know it's him in the casket? Let them show us and we'll be contented,\" he told the BBC.The state funeral will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi on Friday and on Saturday his body will be transported to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria - his political stronghold.Members of the public will get a chance to view the body before he is buried on Sunday at his farm in Bondo, about 60km west of Kisumu.According to the family, it was Odinga's wish to be laid to rest within the shortest time possible, ideally within 72 hours.The 80-year-old former prime minister collapsed during a morning walk in India on Wednesday morning and he was taken to Devamatha Hospital, about 50km (30 miles) east of the port city of Kochi.A seven-day period of mourning has been declared. Odinga would also be accorded a state funeral with full military honours, Ruto said.He was towering figure in Kenyan politics and for many years was the country's main opposition leader, losing five presidential campaigns, most recently three years ago.",

    "body": "60 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: US \"looking at land now\" - Trump confirms CIA authorisation in Venezuela after boat strikesUS President Donald Trump has confirmed a report he authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, provoking outrage from the South American nation's leader.US forces have already conducted at least five strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean in recent weeks, killing 27 people. UN-appointed human rights experts have described the raids as \"extrajudicial executions\".Speaking at the White House, Trump said the US \"is looking at land\" as it considers further strikes on drug cartels in the region. Nicolás Maduro, whose legitimacy as Venezuela's president is internationally contested after disputed elections last year, appealed on TV for peace with the US.He addressed the \"people of the United States\", saying \"no war, yes peace\".The increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack. There are reportedly about 10,000 US forces built up in the Caribbean, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, a US territory.According to the New York Times, Trump's authorisation would allow the CIA to carry out operations in Venezuela unilaterally or as part of any wider US military activity. It remains unknown whether the CIA is planning operations in Venezuela, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies, but the spy agency has a long history of activities in South America. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday alongside FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump was questioned about the New York Times report.\"Why did you authorise the CIA to go into Venezuela?\" a journalist asked.\"I authorised for two reasons really,\" Trump said in a highly unusual acknowledgement from a US commander-in-chief about an intelligence organisation whose activities are typically shrouded in secrecy. \"Number one, they [Venezuela] have emptied their prisons into the United States of America.\" He added: \"And the other thing are drugs. We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we're going to stop them by land also.\"Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade. The president would not be drawn on whether the CIA's goal was to topple Maduro, for whom the US has offered a $50m (£37m) bounty. \"Wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?\" he said. In the most recent US strike on Tuesday, six people were killed when a boat was targeted near Venezuela's coast.On Truth Social, Trump said that \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known DTO [drug-trafficking organisation] drug-trafficking route\". As has been the case in previous strikes, US officials have not specified what drug-trafficking organisation was allegedly operating the vessel, or the identities of those aboard. Maduro took to the airwaves on Wednesday night to warn against escalation.\"No to regime change, which reminds us so much of the endless, failed wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and so on,\" said the Socialist leader. \"No to CIA-orchestrated coups d'état.\"He added: \"Listen to me, no war, yes peace, the people United States.\"Earlier in the day Maduro ordered military exercises in the Caracas suburb of Petare and in neighbouring Miranda state on Wednesday. In a message on Telegram, he said he was mobilising the military, police and civilian militia to defend the oil-rich country.Foreign Minister Yván Gil said on Telegram that Venezuela \"rejects the warmongering and extravagant statements of the president of the United States\".\"We view with extreme alarm the use of the CIA, as well as the military deployments announced in the Caribbean, which amount to a policy of aggression, threat, and harassment against Venezuela,\" he added.Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-power submarine and fighter jets to the Caribbean in what the White House says is an effort to crack down on drug smuggling.In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it had determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of an organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking. Maduro has denied the claims. Mick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and Assistant Undersecretary of Defense, told the BBC: \"In order to conduct covert action, there needs to be a presidential finding for the CIA specially authorizing it, with specific actions identified.\"Mulroy added that such a finding would mark a \"substantial increase\" in efforts against drug trafficking organizations.\"Perhaps a real life 'Sicario',\" he said, referring to a 2015 film that depicts US operatives launching clandestine operations against drug cartels in Mexico.Additional reporting by Ione Wells",

    "body": "3 hours agoDearbail JordanWatch: Wreckage of the Titan submersible on the ocean floor OceanGate's Titan submersible imploded on its journey to the wreck of the Titantic because of poor engineering and multiple failures to test the vessel, according to an official report.Titan imploded in June 2023, killing all five passengers on board including OceanGate's chief executive.The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the engineering process behind the vehicle was \"inadequate\", resulting in faults which meant it failed to meet strength and durability requirements.The NTSB said because the firm did not adequately test Titan it did not know its actual strength. It was also unaware it was damaged and should have been removed from service before its last voyage.Titan footage shows wreckage of destroyed hull on sea floorWhat the Titan failure has taught us about exploring the deep oceanImplosion: The Titanic Sub DisasterTitan disappeared in the North Atlantic as it attempted to dive to the wreck of Titanic which lies some 372 miles from St. John's in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada.In August, the US Coast Guard released a damning report into the implosion which found that the incident was \"preventable\" and criticised OceanGate's \"critically flawed\" safety practices.Stockton Rush, OceanGate's chief executive and co-founder, operated the Titan on its final journey.The passengers, who paid up to $250,000 each to take part in the dive, deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood and Hamish Harding.Designed and built by OceanGate, the Titan was 6.7m (22ft) long with a passenger compartment made of carbon fibre, with titanium used in its domes and some other segments.The doomed submersible which imploded at a depth of 3,363m (11,033ft) - the Titanic wreck is located at 3,880m - was the second version of the craft. OceanGate had condemned the first version following testing.During its investigation, the NTSB discovered issues with the safety culture at OceanGate.While some employees said safety was a priority, others, including a former director of marine operations and a technician, highlighted an environment \"where safety issues, particularly design issues, were ignored\".One technician at the firm said he had concerns about OceanGate's business model, in particular accepting paying clients as \"mission specialists\" as opposed to passengers.Under US regulations, it is illegal to transport passengers in an experimental submersible.The technician told the NTSB that he informed Mr Rush: \"… you can't just change the title of a person when you're receiving compensation.\" In a later conversation on the same subject, the technician recounted that Mr Rush said: \"If the [US] Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away\".OceanGate has permanently wound down its operations since the incident.In its report, the NTSB discovered that a contributing factor to the implosion was that US and international voluntary guidance and US small passenger vessel regulations \"were insufficient to ensure OceanGate adhered to established industry standards\".The NTSB has recommended that the US Coast Guard commissions a study into how so-called pressure vessels which carry people are assessed and, if changes are suggested, regulations be updated.

The case has gripped South Korea as Mr Chey heads the powerful SK Group conglomerate while his ex-wife Roh So-young is the daughter of a former president.The marriage unravelled in 2015 after Mr Chey admitted to fathering a child with his lover.The 1.38 trillion won payout was decided by a court in the capital Seoul in 2024. It was considered the largest divorce settlement in South Korea's history at the time. The court said a 30bn won slush fund by Ms Roh's father, former president Roh Tae-woo, had helped contribute to the growth of SK Group and could be considered as her contribution to the couple's joint assets.Mr Chey then appealed the settlement.On Thursday the Supreme Court ruled that the slush fund \"appeared to have originated from bribes illegally received\" by the former president and thus could not be considered part of the couple's assets.\"I think it is very significant that the Supreme Court clearly declared that it was wrong to recognise that as a contribution to the couple's joint property,\" said Mr Chey's lawyer, Lee Jae-geun.However, the Supreme Court upheld a 2bn won alimony payment for Ms Roh.Shares of SK fell 5.4% after the ruling on Thursday, as it was seen to prolong Mr Chey's legal battle with his ex-wife.But in the short term analysts believe a shake-up at SK Group is unlikely, as Mr Chey is not immediately compelled to raise funds for his divorce settlement.He controls key subsidiaries of the group such as SK Telecom, SK Square and SK Innovation.SK's businesses span the telecommunications, energy, pharmaceuticals and semiconductor sectors.",

    "body": "Indian cinema tickets are getting pricier - but not everyone's complaining12 hours agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiGetty ImagesIndia has seen a steady rise in average movie ticket prices over the past few yearsSahil Arora, 20, had been eagerly waiting to watch the latest Bollywood release starring his favourite actor.But going to the theatre set him back considerably - a seat at a Delhi multiplex cost 500 rupees ($6; £4), nearly a third of his weekly pocket money.\"I enjoyed the movie, but the price was a sore point,\" he said. \"Popcorn was another 500 rupees, so I skipped it.\"He's not alone. Rising ticket and snack prices mean moviegoers are cutting down on their trips to cinema and moving towards cheaper streaming options.Harsh Verma, 38, looks back on a time when going to the movies didn't feel like a luxury.\"Some 15 years ago, my friends and I would go and watch every new release, sometimes every week. That has now become impossible.\"In the past five years, data shows that the average cost of a film ticket in India has risen by 47%.The Average Ticket Price (ATP) in 2020 was 91 rupees, while in 2024 it rose to 134, according to audience research firm Ormax media. However, between 2023 and 2024 there was only a 3% rise in the ATP - suggesting that the prices have stabilised.The report adds that footfall in Indian cinemas has reduced by 6% in 2024 as compared to 2023, continuing a trend in recent years. One of the main reasons why going to movies has become expensive is because single-screen theatres that offered cheaper tickets have now been mostly replaced by plush multi-screen cinemas that offer a host of amenities.But multiplex owners argue that ticket prices are reasonable and that audiences continue to visit in large numbers.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeople say popcorn and cola combo often costs more than the movie ticketSanjeev Kumar Bijli, executive director of multiplex chain PVR INOX Limited which owns more than 1,500 screens across India, told the BBC that the perception that people have stopped going to theatres is \"a general notion squeezed in without fact-checking\".He says his chain has recorded a footfall of 151 million in 2024, up from 140 million in 2023 and the numbers have been promising for this year as well. Mr Bijli acknowledges receiving some feedback about high ticket prices, but says that audiences continue to turn up because they get \"value for money\" - provided a film is good.\"People walk out after three hours feeling satisfied, they've enjoyed themselves in air-conditioned comfort, with superior sound and an immersive experience.\"Mr Bijli says many chains like his are using flexible pricing and weekday offers to attract audiences - for instance, tickets at PVR cost only 92 rupees on Tuesdays.Some Indian states have, however, also placed a cap on ticket prices, sparking a debate on whether this needs to be a nationwide regulation.Mr Bijli argues that price caps don't help them, as steady revenue is vital to maintain and upgrade facilities.Film critic Komal Nahta believes that while lower prices could attract more audiences, owners must retain the freedom to keep their businesses profitable.But, he adds that ticket rates shouldn't be so high that the masses are priced out. \"After all, it's the people who make the stars,\" he says.Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesDelhi's iconic single-screen Regal Theatre permanently closed operations in 2017Meanwhile, experts says that even though single screens offer cheaper tickets, many urban middle-class audiences no longer choose them because they cannot match the comfort and amenities of multiplexes.\"It's a vicious cycle,\" says Nahta. \"Because footfalls are low, cinema owners can't afford proper maintenance. And since the theatres aren't well maintained, people don't want to watch movies there.\"In Delhi, only a handful of single screens still stand. The rest have either shut down or fallen into disrepair, their ageing structures and outdated facilities a reminder of a bygone era.Some patrons, however, remember single screens as simpler, more community spaces.\"There would be 800 to 1,000 people packed in together,\" recalls 61-year-old Renu Bhushan. \"The crowd would erupt when the star appeared on screen while vendors sold cheap snacks and drinks.\"But this nostalgia is not shared by everyone.Mr Verma, says after visiting both single screens and multiplexes over the past two decades, he prefers the latter. \"The seats [at single screens] are uncomfortable and the experience isn't great,\" he says.Annu Gupta also prefers multiplexes because they offer better facilities, clean toilets and security. Industry experts say theatres are also facing competition from cheaper streaming options which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic. As audiences kept away, many theatres went out of business. \"With affordable subscriptions, people now watch most big releases within six-to-eight weeks at their homes,\" says film trade expert and marketing analyst Girish Wankhede.A monthly subscription to a streaming platform costs less than two tickets in a multiplex. For families, the math is even clearer.But Mr Bijli of PVR says that with the pandemic a distant memory now, the audience behaviour is shifting again and people are returning to theatres.Cinema and streaming are meant to co-exist and this isn't the first time the industry has faced existential questions, he says.\"Cinema has faced challenges from TV, VHS and DVDs. Every time a new content medium emerged, people wrote off cinema, but it survived. \"It offers an immersive, uninterrupted experience that you simply can't get at home.\"Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "15 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentGetty ImagesVirginia Giuffre describes how the photo was taken by Jeffrey Epstein in LondonA posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre accuses the Duke of York of being \"entitled - as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright\", according to extracts published in the Guardian newspaper.The book, Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is due to be published next week, almost six months after Ms Giuffre took her own life.Her book, which calls Epstein a \"master manipulator\", describes three occasions where she alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her, including at Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London. It's further embarrassment for Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, and has always denied any wrongdoing.Getty ImagesVirginia Giuffre holding a picture of herself as a teenagerNobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, is the testimony of Ms Giuffre, who died by suicide in Australia in April, in a book co-written with author Amy Wallace.Ms Giuffre, who met Jeffrey Epstein through Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.The powerful friends were claimed to include Prince Andrew and the extract published in the Guardian gives her account of when they met in London in March 2001, when she was aged 17.She says the day began by being woken by Ghislaine Maxwell: \"It was going to be a special day, she said. Just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince!\"When Andrew arrived later she claims that he was asked to guess her age. \"The Duke of York, who was then 41, guessed correctly: 17. 'My daughters are just a little younger than you,' he told me, explaining his accuracy. As usual, Maxwell was quick with a joke: 'I guess we will have to trade her in soon.',\" says her memoir.Like Epstein, she said she called him \"Andy\".There is also an account of the notorious photograph from that evening.\"My mom would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn't pose for a picture. \"I ran to get a Kodak FunSaver from my room, then returned and handed it to Epstein. I remember the prince putting his arm around my waist as Maxwell grinned beside me. Epstein snapped the photo,\" she writes.They went to dinner and then Tramp nightclub, she recalls, saying Andrew was a \"bumbling dancer, and I remember he sweated profusely\". \"On the way back, Maxwell told me, 'When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey'.\"She says of what happened next: \"He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.\"As has been reported before, she claimed he was \"particularly attentive to my feet, caressing my toes and licking my arches\". And that later Epstein gave her $15,000 for her time with Andrew.Getty ImagesPrince Andrew has continued to face questions about links to EpsteinThe book also reports two other occasions on which she alleges she had sex with Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.All three of the claimed meetings with Andrew have been reported in detail before, including in her previous witness statements and accounts, but this brings them together and provides her own perspective.\"Don't be fooled by those in Epstein's circle who say they didn't know what he was doing. Epstein not only didn't hide what was happening, he took a certain glee in making people watch,\" she writes.The book also reveals that she was taking tranquilisers to cope with her life working for Epstein.\"Sometimes, when I was really struggling, I took as many as eight Xanax a day,\" she writes.She also explained why she didn't leave \"Epstein's lair even after we knew what he wanted from us.\" \"How can you complain about being abused, some have asked, when you could so easily have stayed away? But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable,\" she writes.\"Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care.\"After leaving Epstein, Ms Giuffre had settled in Australia where she lived with her husband and three children. She took her own life at the age of 41.Epstein had killed himself in jail in New York in while awaiting trial. Ghislaine Maxwell was jailed on charges related to sex trafficking.Prince Andrew made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement, after she had brought a civil case against him, and he denies all the accusations made against him.He refutes Ms Giuffre's claims about having sex with him at the three locations: \"I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened,\" Andrew said in his BBC Newsnight interview.\"I can tell you categorically I don't remember meeting her at all. I do not remember a photograph being taken and I've said consistently and frequently that we never had any sort of sexual contact whatever,\" he said.Prince Andrew has faced challenges over aspects of his own account.He said he had cut all links with Epstein after seeing him in New York in December 2010, but an email later emerged from February 2011 which suggested Andrew was still in touch, with the promise to \"play some more soon\".The Duke of York's office has been contacted for comment.If you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line.",

This is one of multiple buildings targeted in this areaMs Howarth told the BBC's Newsday programme that in the last few months civilians had been driven by the RSF from the displacement camps around el-Fasher and other neighbourhoods by arson and in some cases by what looked like \"house-to-house clearance operations\".They were now in their last places of refuge in \"increasingly smaller zones\", concentrated in shelters at mosques, near hospitals and markets - areas that were undergoing repeated bombardment.Satellite images showed \"burn scars\" where specific buildings had been targeted with \"horrific\" results, according to Ms Howarth.\"We had air-deployed munitions - this could be a combination of drone and artillery that came in… through the roofs, exploding on impact and then burning everything that was within those structures,\" she explained, adding that ground sources had told them the people inside had been \"burned alive\".The Yale HRL researchers found that over the last month attacks included those on two shelters, one of which was also a community kitchen, two mosques, one hospital and one market - killing at least 174 people and wounding at least 123 people.\"These incidents include only those that HRL corroborated through either remote sensing, open source documentation, or a combination of both methods and are likely an undercount,\" its report said.\"These actions are prima facie war crimes and may rise to the level of crimes against humanity.\"The researchers also identified that between 26 September and 10 October, at least 60 burial mounds were created in a new cemetery in the Daraja Oula neighbourhood, one of the only areas still under the control of the army and their allies, local armed groups known as the Joint Forces.Ms Howarth said there were now only four RSF-controlled exits out of the city.\"There should be calls for the immediate cessation of these hostilities, for civilians to be allowed to immediately and safely depart el-Fasher without harassment, without taxation, without the risk of extrajudicial execution,\" she said.\"And aid and humanitarian aid access should be allowed completely in without any threat of bombardment or attack.\"More about Sudan's civil war:Medics under siege: 'We took this photo, fearing it would be our last''Our children are dying': Rare footage shows plight of civilians in besieged Sudan citySudan in danger of self-destructing as conflict and famine reignGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "China arrested 30 Christians. Some fear it's the start of a bigger crackdown14 hours agoTessa WongAsia Digital Reporter andKelly NgReutersJin Mingri, seen here in a 2018 file photo, is one of 30 Christians arrested in China last weekendLast Friday Grace Jin Drexel received a text from her father in China, the prominent pastor Jin Mingri, telling her to pray for another pastor who had gone missing.The text said that the other pastor had been detained while visiting the southern  city of Shenzhen.\"Shortly after that, I got a call from my mum. She said she couldn't contact my dad,\" Ms Jin Drexel, who lives in the US, told the BBC. Within hours her family realised that Mr Jin had also been caught up in what has been described by activists as China's largest arrest of Christians in decades.Some now fear that last weekend's roundup of 30 Christians linked to the Zion Church network, which Mr Jin founded, marks the start of what could be a wider crackdown on underground churches.They point to new laws passed in China which appear aimed at curbing underground church activity, and increasing pressure exerted by authorities on church members in recent months.Despite being ruled by the atheist Chinese Communist Party, China has a sizeable Christian population. Government figures in recent years have stated there are about 38 million Protestants and nearly six million Catholics.But these figures likely only account for members of churches registered with the officially approved Catholic Patriotic Association and the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which emphasise loyalty to China and the Communist Party.Rights activists and scholars estimate that tens of millions more Chinese attend unregistered churches, also known as house churches, which do not follow state-sanctioned ideologies.Many of these churches have been impacted by the Chinese government's attempts to increase its control of religious groups over the years. Church buildings have been demolished and crosses have been removed from public view, while religious material has become more tightly policed, with some Christian apps banned in China.In 2005 and again in 2018, the government revised and tightened regulations on religious groups, while in 2016, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for the \"sinicisation\" of religion.Underground churches such as Zion were especially affected by the 2018 rules, which required government approval for worshipping in public. Many were forced to stop public activities and turned to holding online services, or simply shut down.The following years also saw the arrests and sentencing of a few prominent pastors.In recent months, there have been signs of Chinese authorities once again tightening the screws. In May, pastor Gao Quanfu of the Light of Zion Church in Xi'an was detained on charges of \"using superstitious activities to undermine the implementation of law\". The following month saw several members of the Linfen Golden Lampstand Church in Shanxi sentenced to years in prison for fraud, which rights groups have criticised as false convictions.Then in September, authorities announced a new online code of conduct for religious personnel, which only allows online sermons to be conducted by licensed groups. This has been widely seen as an attempt to curtail underground churches' online services.In the last few months, Zion church members have also faced increasing questioning by police officers, Ms Jin Drexel said.Many in Zion saw the stepped-up pressure as a prelude to a crackdown, but few anticipated it would be as large as it turned out to be, she said.Last Friday and Saturday, Chinese authorities launched what's been described as a sweeping crackdown across at least 10 cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Besides Mr Jin who was taken from his main base in Beihai city in Guangxi province, they arrested other pastors, leaders and members of the congregation, according to the church.CSWPolice officers arresting pastor Sun Cong of Zion Church (centre) were seen going through his booksThe BBC has obtained a copy of what appears to be an official detention notice for Mr Jin, issued by the public security bureau in Beihai. It states that Mr Jin is currently held in the Beihai Number Two prison and that he is suspected of \"illegal use of information networks\".The BBC has asked local authorities to confirm the detention.Some of the arrested church members have since been released, but the majority are thought to still be in detention, with some housed in the same prison as Mr Jin.Corey Jackson, founder of Christian advocacy group Luke Alliance, said the nationwide scale and co-ordination of the arrests across China were unprecedented.\"We anticipate that this is just the beginning of a larger crackdown,\" he said, adding that other underground churches in China were now preparing themselves for arrests.Another Christian advocacy group, Open Doors, said the arrests were significant. \"Zion Church was very well known and outspoken and it may have reached the level of organisation that authorities are getting nervous about organised social entities they do not control,\" a spokesperson said.He warned that China's \"policy of acting against house churches will continue\" and that authorities may accuse more church members of fraud and economic crimes \"as a strategy of intimidation\".Sean Long, a Zion Church pastor and spokesperson based in the US, said other churches will be targeted as there is \"a new wave of religious persecution emerging quickly across China\".He called the latest arrests a \"systematic roundup\" to \"unroot Zion\", and quoted the Chinese idiom \"killing the chicken to scare the monkeys\".\"Zion is the chicken, we are the most influential... it's to scare other Christians and house churches in China.\"When asked by the BBC for a response, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said: \"We would like to stress that the Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious belief in accordance with law. Meanwhile, all religious groups and religious activities must comply with the laws and regulations of China.\"Earlier this week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it \"firmly opposes the US interfering in China's internal affairs with so-called religious issues\", in response to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's condemnation of the Zion church arrests.Getty ImagesChina officially has 38 million Protestants and six million Catholics, but tens of millions more Chinese are believed to attend underground churchesZion's story began with Jin Mingri, also known as Ezra Jin. Born in 1969 during the Cultural Revolution in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, he was a believer in the Chinese state while growing up.That changed in 1989 when, as a student in the prestigious Beijing University, he began taking part in the pro-democracy movement that was eventually crushed in the Tiananmen Massacre.While he did not happen to be at Tiananmen on 4 June, the events at the square changed his life. \"It was a pivotal moment. For his whole life, he had faith in the state. When that was betrayed, it shattered his entire world view. It was a big come-to-Jesus moment,\" Ms Jin Drexel said.At first Mr Jin pursued his new Christian faith at a Three-Self church. In 2002 he moved to the US with his wife and daughter to study at a seminary in California, where his two sons were born.The family moved back to China in 2007 for Mr Jin to continue his work. But he decided to set up an independent church,  said Ms Jin Drexel, as he could no longer accept the Three-Self doctrine which calls for allegiance to the Chinese state. \"He couldn't be a pastor there as it was not a God-pleasing church... you can't serve two masters.\"Zion began as a small house church in Beijing with just 20 followers. But over the years it expanded and began holding services in a large hall in an office building. As it grew in influence, so did the scrutiny. In 2018, Chinese authorities asked the church to install CCTV cameras in the building, saying it was for \"security\". When it refused, followers began facing what church leaders say was harassment. Later that year, the church was shut down.An exit ban was imposed on Mr Jin, who was placed under close surveillance. His family was able to leave for the US, as did some other church members such as Mr Long.Zion then pivoted to what Mr Long called a \"hybrid model\" where they would hold large online church services coupled with small offline meetings in person. The church grew to about 100 branches across 40 cities in China, and has more than 10,000 followers now.It is why, while the fate of Mr Jin and the other arrested church members remains uncertain and the possibility of a wider crackdown looms, Mr Long is confident that Zion and China's underground churches will survive.\"Persecution cannot destroy the church,\" he said. \"If you look back to history, where there is repression, there's a revival.\"Read more of our China coverage",

    "body": "2 days agoPaul MellyWest Africa analystAFP via Getty ImagesSpain is kicking against the prevailing political mood among Western nations when it comes to migration and policies regarding the African continent.At a time when the US, the UK, France and Germany are all cutting back their development aid budgets, Madrid remains committed to continued expansion, albeit from a lower starting point.This week, the Spanish capital has been hosting an African Union-backed \"world conference on people of African descent\". AfroMadrid2025 will discuss restorative justice and the creation of a new development fund.It is just the latest sign of how Spain's socialist-led government is seeking to deepen and diversify its engagement with the continent and near neighbour that lies just a few kilometres to the south, across the Straits of Gibraltar.In July Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares launched a new advisory council of prominent intellectual, diplomatic and cultural figures, more than half of them African, to monitor the delivery of the detailed Spain-Africa strategy that his government published at the end of last year.New embassies south of the Sahara, and partnerships in business and education are planned.The contrast between Spain's approach and that of others in the West is not just in spending but in tone and mindset – and nowhere more so than in dealing with migration.Similar to elsewhere in Europe, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is looking for ways to contain the influx of irregular arrivals.Like other centre-left and centre-right leaders, he finds himself facing an electoral challenge from the radical right, largely driven by some voters' concern over migration, with the hardline Vox party well established in parliament and routinely ranking third in opinion polls.In July, extra security forces had to be deployed against racist gangs roaming the streets of Torre Pacheco, in Murcia region – where many Africans work in the booming horticultural sector – after three Moroccans were accused of beating a pensioner.While the opposition conservative People's Party remains favourable to some immigration, but for cultural reasons wants to prioritise Latin Americans rather than Africans, Vox has been more radical.Responding to the Murcia incident Vox called for a crackdown on immigrants taking up less skilled jobs. The message largely targeted Africans working in fruit and vegetable production, now so crucial to the southern Spanish economy.But for the government the migration presents challenges that are as much practical as political.AFP via Getty ImagesThousands try to make the crossing to the Canary Islands on packed wooden boatsMore than 45,000 people made the perilous sea crossing from Africa's west coast to the Spanish archipelago of the Canary Islands last year. Estimates of those who died while making the attempt range between 1,400 and a staggering 10,460.Others make the shorter journey across the Gibraltar Straits or the Mediterranean to land on Andalusian beaches or try to scramble over the border fences of Ceuta and Melilla, the two Spanish enclave towns on the North African coast.The Spanish administration has to accommodate new arrivals, process their claims and manage their absorption into wider society, whether temporary or more long-lasting.However, in language markedly different from the hostile messaging that emanates from many European capitals, the Sanchez government openly acknowledges the hard economic realities on the ground in West Africa that push people to risk their lives in the effort to reach Europe.And it is trying to move beyond simply saying \"no\" to new arrivals. Instead, it is developing creative alternatives, with a promise to foster movements of people that are safe, orderly and regular and \"mutually beneficial\".On his trip to Mauritania last year, Sanchez stressed the contribution that migrants make to the Spanish economy.\"For us, the migratory phenomenon is not only a question of moral principles, solidarity and dignity, but also one of rationality,\" the prime minister said.The Spanish government funds training schemes for unemployed youth in countries such as Senegal, especially for irregular migrants who have been sent back, to help them develop viable new livelihoods back home.And it has expanded a \"circular migration\" programme that gives West Africans short-term visas to come to Spain for limited periods of seasonal work, mainly in agriculture, and then return.These issues were at the heart of the agenda when Sanchez visited Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania in August last year.A circular migration agreement with the former had been in place since 2021, but similar accords with the Mauritanian and Gambian governments have since followed.The underlying case for this singular approach was set out in detail in the foreign ministry's Spain-Africa strategy. This argued that Europe and Africa \"form part of the same geopolitical space\".But the management of migration is only one motive for the Spanish decision to place emphasis on building relations with Africa – and indeed support a much broader related social-cultural agenda.AFP via Getty ImagesSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (R) met Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani (L) in Madrid last yearThe fundamental premise underlying Madrid's outreach is that Spain, as the European country closest to the continent, has an essential self interest in Africa's progress towards inclusive and sustainable development, and peace and security.That basic rationale might seem obvious.Yet of course history had taken Spain down a quite different path.Other than a few Maghreb footholds and a small tropical outpost – today's independent Equatorial Guinea – its colonial expansion in the 16th and 17th Centuries had mainly been directed across the Atlantic.And over recent decades, European affairs and the Middle East had tended to dominate Madrid's foreign policy priorities, while the main beneficiaries of its development support were the countries of its vast former empire in Central and South America.However, the past few years have seen the Sanchez government preside over a fundamental broadening of outlook.Barely had Albares been installed as foreign minister in July 2021 than he launched a restructuring of his department, in part to strengthen its engagement not only with Latin America but also with the Sahel and North Africa.Confirmation of the wider geographical emphasis came with a development co-operation plan for 2024-27, which for the first time, designated West Africa, including the Sahel, as one of three regions prioritised for assistance, alongside Central and South America.Spain's Africa strategy lays heavy emphasis not just on economic sectors such as infrastructure, digitalisation and energy transition but also particularly on education and youth employment.The cultural dimension includes not only promotion of the Spanish language, with an expanded presence of the Cervantes Institute, but also programmes to help the mobility of academic teachers and researchers.Security co-operation, action on climate change, women's empowerment and an expanded diplomatic presence are unsurprising components in today's environment.However, the strategy also lays very public stress it places on supporting democratic ideas, the African Union and, in particular, the West African regional organisation Ecowas.This will be welcome public encouragement for the latter, which is currently under severe pressure after seeing its 50th anniversary year marred by the walk-out of the Sahelian states – Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger – whose ruling military juntas have refused to comply with its protocol on democracy and good governance.Meanwhile, in a message targeted as much at Madrid's domestic audience as its sub-Saharan partners, the foreign ministry said \"supporting the African diaspora and the fight against racism and xenophobia are also key priorities\".Fine words of course are only a first step. But in today's sour international climate such language really does stand out.Paul Melly is a consulting fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House in London.You may also be interested in:Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy'Try or die' - one man's determination to get to the Canary Islands'I found out on social media that my son had died'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoJeremy BowenInternational editor'We want to raise our children': Life in Gaza after hostages and prisoners releasedDonald Trump's quick trip to Israel and Egypt was the victory lap he wanted.Anyone watching the speeches he made in Jerusalem and Sharm el-Sheikh could see a man luxuriating in his power - enjoying the applause in Israel's parliament, and in Egypt, basking in the fact that so many heads of state and government had flown in. One veteran diplomat in the room said it looked as if Trump saw the role of the world leaders there as extras on his film set.Trump's message at Sharm was, in effect, that he had created a historical turning point.\"All I've done all my life is deals. The greatest deals just sort of happen… That's what happened right here. And maybe this is going to be the greatest deal of them all,\" he said. Observers might also have had the impression from the speeches that the job is done. It is not.Without question, Trump can claim credit for the ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. Qatar, Turkey and Egypt used their leverage with Hamas to force it to accept. That made it a joint effort, but Trump's role was decisive. Live coverage of this storyWithout his push to demand Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's agreement to terms that he had previously rejected, the deal would not have been signed.It helps to recognise what the deal is – and what it isn't. The agreement was for a ceasefire and an exchange of hostages for prisoners. It is not a peace agreement, or even the start of a peace process.The next phase of the Trump 20-point plan requires an agreement filling in the gaps of the framework which declares that the Gaza Strip will be demilitarised, secured and governed by a committee including Palestinians. It will report to a Board of Peace chaired by President Trump. Significant work needs to be done on the detail needed to make that happen.The Gaza agreement is not a route map to peace in the Middle East, the ultimate and so far, unreachable destination.ReutersNetanyahu called Trump the 'greatest friend' Israel had ever had in the White HouseJust as seriously, there is no evidence of the political will necessary to make a real peace deal. Most wars end with exhausted belligerents making some kind of agreement. The war in Gaza has become one of those, if as Trump has declared, it really is over.The other way to end a war is with a total victory that lets the winners dictate the way ahead. The best example is the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945.Before 9 September, when Netanyahu ordered a missile strike on Qatar he seemed to still be intent on crushing Israel's enemy so comprehensively, that Israel would be able to dictate the future of Gaza. The strike infuriated Trump. Qatar is one of America's key allies in the region, and the site of the biggest US military base in the Middle East. It is also a place where his sons have been doing lucrative business. Trump dismissed Netanyahu's justification that the target, which was missed, was the Hamas leadership, not Qatar. For Trump, America's interests come before Israel's. He is not like Joe Biden, who was prepared to accept harm to America's position in the region as the necessary price for supporting Israel.CCTV captures moment of Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in DohaTrump is back in Washington DC. Diplomats say the Americans realise that getting the detail sorted out is vital and will not happen quickly. The problem is that they might not have enough time. Ceasefires always get violated in their early stages. The ones that survive tend to be based on a tight agreements, made by warring parties who have decided that their best option is to make them work.The danger is that the Gaza ceasefire lacks those underpinnings. Only 24 hours after Israelis and Palestinians, for very different reasons, shared joy and relief that hostages, prisoners and detainees were home, cracks are appearing in the ceasefire.Hamas has, so far, returned only seven of the bodies of the 28 hostages who were killed during their incarceration. Its explanation is that it is very hard to find their graves in the sea of rubble that Israel has created in Gaza.Israel's patience is thin. The fate of the bodies of the hostages will become a bigger and bigger issue in Israel if their remains are not repatriated.As a first response, Israel has said that until Hamas fulfils its obligations it will cut the flow of aid into Gaza in half, and will not reopen Gaza's border crossing with Egypt - the Rafah crossing.Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's extremist ultranationalist finance minister who opposes the Gaza deal, posted on social media that \"only military pressure brings back hostages\".The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) still occupies 53% of the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, its soldiers killed Palestinians who they said were approaching their forces. Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza told the BBC that seven people were killed in two incidents.It could be that the IDF is still observing the rules of engagement that it was using before the ceasefire. They order troops to watch two imaginary lines around their positions. If one is crossed, they fire warning shots. If Palestinians continue to approach their positions and cross a second imaginary line, IDF troops can shoot to kill. A big problem with the system is that Palestinians do not know where the lines are. It is crowd control with live fire.As for Hamas, it is reasserting its power. Its men, armed and masked are back on the streets. It has attacked rival armed clans, some of which have been protected by the IDF. Videos have circulated of Hamas killing blindfolded and kneeling men who they have accused of collaborating with the Israelis. The grisly videos of extra-judicial executions in the street send a message to any Palestinians who want to defy them that they should not dare - and to the outside world that Hamas has survived Israel's onslaught.ReutersGaza City has been reduced to grey rubblePoint 15 of the Trump plan for Gaza says the US \"will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza\". Raising and deploying that force will be impossible if the ceasefire is not solid. Potential contributors will not send in their troops to use force to disarm Hamas.Hamas has hinted it might give up some heavy weapons but will not be disarmed. It has an ideology of Islamic resistance to Israel, and knows that without weapons its Palestinian enemies will come for revenge. Netanyahu has threatened that if no-one else will do it, Israel will finish the job. Hamas's weapons have to go, he has said, the \"easy way or the hard way\".Trump has proclaimed that his Gaza deal, as it stands, will end generations of conflict between Arabs and Jews over the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He insists too that it will lead to a broader peace across the Middle East. If he really believes that the job of making peace is done, then he is deluding himself. Just trying needs sustained focus, hard diplomatic work and a decision by the two sides in the fight that the time has come to make painful sacrifices and compromises. To make peace, other dreams have to be jettisoned.Past American presidents have also believed that they can make peace in the Middle East. Trump will discover that peace is not made just because a president, however powerful, decides that it is going to happen.",

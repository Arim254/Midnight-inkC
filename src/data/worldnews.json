    "body": "6 hours agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled in December when it convicted him. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied, including sedition under a separate colonial-era law.  The most serious one, colluding with foreign forces, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.On 9 February, the court jailed him for 20 years in a hearing that lasted less than 30 minutes. It is the harshest sentence given so far under the NSL - \"an effective death sentence\", given his age, according to rights groups.    \"Never,\" Lai had said to the charge of collusion when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".His conviction in December was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

    "body": "15 hours agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesTwo identical twins on trial for murder in France have confounded attempts to determine which one pulled the trigger because they have the same DNA, French media report.The 33-year-old brothers are among five defendants on trial near Paris, accused of a double murder and several subsequent attempted killings in 2020, according to reputable French newspaper Le Parisien.It reports that both are suspected of conspiring to plot the double murder, but that DNA on an assault rifle used in one of the later gun battles could only be from one twin.A police officer told the court that forensic experts were unable to tell which of the brothers had been conclusively implicated.\"Only their mother can tell them apart,\" one investigator is quoted as telling the court in Bobigny, north of the French capital.There is reportedly a tense atmosphere in the court where the trial is taking place. On Tuesday, both twins were said to have been expelled from the courtroom for refusing to stand up.Police believe they have taken advantage of their resemblance to cover their tracks. A senior officer quoted by Le Parisien said the pair frequently exchanged clothes, phones and identification documents.Identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits during pregnancy. Because they originate from the same egg and sperm, they share exactly the same DNA, making forensic identification extremely difficult.With genetic data unable to distinguish between them, investigators relied on phone records, surveillance footage, wiretaps and efforts to corroborate their whereabouts and movements, according to Le Parisien.But the crucial question of who fired the recovered weapon remains an open one. The trial continues, with court due to reach a decision in late February.",

    "body": "48 minutes agoYang TianGetty ImagesVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said her opposition colleague Juan Pablo Guanipa has been kidnapped just hours after being released from detention.The Nobel Peace Prize winner said on Sunday that Guanipa, leader of the Justice First party, was taken in the Los Chorros neighbourhood of the capital, Caracas.\"Heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force,\" she wrote on social media early on Monday. A former vice-president of the National Assembly, Guanipa spent eight months in prison and was among several political prisoners released since the US seized Venezuela's then-President Nicolás Maduro in January.Guanipa's centre-right party said he had been kidnapped by the \"repressive forces of the dictatorship\" while he was moving between locations.They added that those accompanying him said weapons were pointed at the group before Guanipa was loaded into a car.\"We hold Delcy Rodríguez, Jorge Rodríguez, and Diosdado Cabello responsible for any harm to Juan Pablo's life,\" Justice First wrote on social media, referring to Venezuela's interim president, the National Assembly speaker, and the interior minister respectively. The party also called on the international community to demand the \"immediate release\" of Guanipa and an end to the Venezuelan government's \"persecution of the opposition\".Just hours earlier, Guanipa's son Ramón was celebrating his father's release on social media: \"Our entire family will be able to hug again soon.\" He subsequently posted a video online in which he demanded immediate proof that his father was still alive.\"I hold the regime responsible for anything that happens to my father. Enough of this repression,\" Ramón Guanipa said in the video.Guanipa was among at least 30 people freed on Sunday, according to Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in Venezuela.The leader of the Justice First party, he was elected governor of the Zulia region in 2017 but was barred from taking office after he refused to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.Guanipa went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 election result.He was tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025. Opposition and human rights groups say the government under Maduro had for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.",

    "body": "6 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesTrain drivers in Spain are due to begin a three-day nationwide strike on Monday in protest of what they say is a lack of safety guarantees on the country's rail system.The action follows two fatal train crashes in January, one in Adamuz in the country's southern region which killed 46 people, and the second just two days later near Barcelona where a train driver died and dozens were injured.The accidents have caused severe disruption for travellers and cast doubt on Spain's much-vaunted rail system.Semaf, the train drivers' union, are demanding the hiring of more staff and increased investment and maintenance in what it has described as \"the constant deterioration of the rail network\".Following the two collisions, subsequent safety checks also revealed faults and maintenance issues on a number of routes.Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is due to be grilled in parliament later this week about the failures in the rail system.A preliminary report by rail accident investigation commission CIAF has found that grooves found on the wheels of the derailed train and three earlier trains suggests that a fracture in the track occurred before the train went over it.Rail officials believe the wall collapsed as the train was passing, striking the driver's cab first and then causing considerable damage to the first carriage of the train in which most of the injured passengers were travelling.Semaf has previously said the collisions represent \"a turning point in demanding that all necessary actions be taken to guarantee the safety of railway operations\".The amount of investment the rail network receives has come under particular scrutiny. The Socialist-led government has sought to dismiss such queries, pointing out that €700m (£605m) has been invested in updating the Madrid-Andalusia line in recent years, with the stretch of track where the accident took place included in that renovation.\"We're not looking at a problem of lack of maintenance, we're not looking at a problem of obsolete [infrastructure], and we're not looking at a problem of lack of investment,\" said Transport Minister Óscar Puente.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandSimon AtkinsonBBCMany of the victims had moved to New Zealand to work or study, and some were refugees who thought they had found safetyA white supremacist who killed 51 people at two New Zealand mosques has appeared in court to try and withdraw his guilty plea.Australian Brenton Tarrant is serving a life sentence with no parole after admitting to murdering the 51 people and attempting to murder another 40 in the March 2019 attack on worshippers during Friday prayers in Christchurch.He initially denied the charges, but changed his plea a year after the attack.The 35-year-old, who also admitted one count of terrorism, has now launched an appeal, filed out of time, arguing he was incapable of making rational decisions at the time because of \"torturous and inhumane\" conditions in prison. He also wants to appeal against his sentence. The hearing at New Zealand's Court of Appeal in Wellington is scheduled to run all week, with Tarrant expected to give evidence via video link.The massacre at Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre - parts of which were live-streamed - led to stricter gun laws in New Zealand.'He wants to open traumas again'Victims and family members will be able to watch the hearing via a delayed broadcast.Among those planning to attend is Aya al-Umari, who lost her older brother Hussein in the attack on Al Noor mosque.\"I very distinctly remember that I left court after the sentencing thinking 'Right, the trauma chapter is now closed, time to heal, time to focus on your own mental well-being', but then it pops up again and again,\" al-Umari told the BBC.She said she was preparing for a tough week, seeing the man who murdered her brother on screen.\"It will be just an image that I am looking at, because he means absolutely nothing to me at this stage.\"I suspect one of his main motivations to do this is to open up traumas again and I won't let him succeed in doing that - he just wants his limelight and to be relevant again.\"Hussein al-Umari was awarded a New Zealand Bravery Star, for standing up to Tarrant.\"He took the right of life of my brother and 50 others, and then we're going to sit through now and talk about the legal arguments of his right to appeal,\" al-Umari  said. \"When you place those two together, they are morally not comparable.\"Family handoutAya al-Umari and her brother HusseinAt the time of the sentencing in August 2020, then Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern said life imprisonment without parole meant Tarrant would have \"no notoriety, no platform... and we have no cause to think about him, to see him or to hear from him again\".If the three appeal court judges decide he can withdraw his guilty plea, the case would potentially go to trial on all charges.If he is not allowed to retract his plea, there will be another hearing later in the year to consider his appeal against his sentence.Tarrant was born in New South Wales, Australia, but moved to New Zealand in 2017 - which, prosecutors said, was when he started planning his attacks against the Muslim community.He was active on fringe online forums and before the attack, he had posted a 74-page \"manifesto\" online.The massacre prompted New Zealand to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners.Within a month of the shootings, the country's parliament had voted overwhelmingly to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms.The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme.",

    "body": "44 minutes agoKoh Ewe,news reporter,Shaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentandOsmond Chia,business reporterAFP via Getty ImagesThe Nikkei 225 briefly surpassed 57,000 for the first time after the electionJapanese stocks surged to a record high on Monday, as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) basked in a historic election victory.The LDP secured 316 out of 465 seats in Sunday's election, the first time a single party has won a two-thirds lower house majority since Japan's parliament was established in its current form in 1947.The Japan Innovation Party, the LDP's coalition partner, won in 36 more constituencies, taking their combined total to 352 seats.The resounding mandate is a gamble that paid off for Takaichi, who now faces the challenge of reviving Japan's moribund economy and tackling cost-of-living woes. The Nikkei 225 index rallied by more than 5% in early trade on Monday, briefly crossing the 57,000 mark for the first time. It then gave up some gains, but still closed up 3.9% at a record high of 56,363.94.The LDP's decisive win will help Takaichi advance her pro-business policies without having to negotiate extensively with opposition parties.Takaichi told reporters on Sunday that she would pursue a \"responsible yet aggressive\" fiscal policy and would not reshuffle the Cabinet, which was formed less than four months ago.Japan's first female prime minister called the snap election last month, just a few months after taking office in October. Her success is in marked contrast to her two predecessors, under whom the party lost its parliamentary majority, battled corruption scandals and struggled to curb rising costs.Markets commentators say Takaichi's policies could boost the Japanese economy. The election outcome and upcoming moves like \"stimulus, tax tweaks, and deregulation\" will be \"additional fuel for an existing bull trend\", investment analyst Yuka Marosek told the BBC.Chris Scicluna, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe, said Japanese stock investors had \"long been believers in Takaichi\".\"They're confident that Japanese firms will benefit from her pledge to end austerity, they love her promises of more investment to boost growth, [and] they like the fact she's identified several strategic sectors such as defence and AI to benefit from extra policy support,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.However, he added that investors in Japanese government bonds and the yen were \"a lot more agnostic if not downright sceptical\" about Takaichi's intentions.\"Japanese government debt's extremely high and investors in bonds and the yen want to know how she intends to finance her plans,\" he said.Historically low inflation in the country has made it very sensitive to the rising cost of living over recent years.At this election, voters at polling stations told the BBC that they were worried about the increasing costs of groceries and rent.The economy is also under pressure from the country's ageing population, which has seen a shrinking workforce and ballooning social care costs.Takaichi has pledged to cut taxes and boost the Japanese economy through more spending - though where that money will come from is another big concern, given Japan's high government debt. Critics warn this could deepen instability in Japan's already fragile economy.\"We bear an extremely heavy responsibility to focus on steadily delivering on the campaign pledges we have made,\" Takaichi said on Sunday as her party's victory became clear, Kyodo reported.The LDP had lost its parliamentary majority under Takaichi's predecessor Shigeru Ishiba. And Takaichi banked on her personal appeal to turn the LDP's lost fortunes around.She has consolidated support among the LDP's conservative base by reviving long-dormant goals like revision to Japan's pacifist constitution and emphasising traditional values.But she has also connected with younger voters in a way not seen before: her handbags and pink pens have become unlikely zeitgeist items.US President Donald Trump congratulated Takaichi on her victory, writing on Truth Social that it was an \"Honor\" to endorse her ahead of the election.\"The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support,\" Trump said.Just one week after Takaichi took office in October last year, Tokyo rolled out the red carpet for Trump when he visited Japan. It was her diplomatic debut, and the optics were striking: fists pumping as the US president praised her in front of thousands of US soldiers.Takaichi is due to travel to Washington in March for a second meeting with Trump.

The Narges Foundation says the latest sentence brings the total time she has been ordered to spend in prison to 44 years.Since 2021, she has been serving a 13-year sentence for \"propaganda activity against the state\" and \"collusion against state security\", charges she denies.The activist was given temporary release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison for three weeks in December 2024 on medical grounds.She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences.The most recent arrest came as she attended a memorial for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer who had been found dead in his office in early December.Norway-based group Iran Human Rights has called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances surrounding his death were \"suspicious\".The Narges Foundation previously said eyewitnesses had seen Mohammadi being attacked by around 15 plainclothes agents of the regime while at the memorial event, and that some were seen pulling her hair and beating her with clubs and batons.Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar told reporters that Mohammadi had been among 39 people arrested, and she and Alikordi's brother had encouraged those present \"to chant norm-breaking slogans\" and \"disturb the peace\".Mohammadi was among signatories of a petition that expressed criticism of the Iranian authorities and held Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responsible for what it called \"crimes against humanity\" over the killing of protesters during unrest that began in late December.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has counted more than 50,000 arrests related to the demonstrations and had confirmed at least 6,961 deaths.The petition called for the prosecution of those acting on Khamenei's orders and an end to the Islamic Republic.Four prominent Iranian activists - identified as Abdollah Momeni, Mehdi Mahmoudian, Vida Rabbani and Ghorban Behzadian-Nejad - have also been arrested since 31 January for their contribution to the petition.Taghi Rahmani urged the release of \"all political prisoners in Iran\".",

    "body": "15 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersFriday's shooting took place at a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of MoscowRussia says it has identified three suspects involved in the shooting of high-profile military figure Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev. They include the man accused of having carried out the attack, named as Ukrainian-born Russian citizen Lyubomir Korba. Russia's Investigations Committee (SK) said Korba arrived in the capital, Moscow, in late December \"on assignment from Ukrainian intelligence services to commit a terrorist attack\". Kyiv has reportedly denied involvement.Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of Moscow on Friday. He has since regained consciousness following surgery, according to Russian media reports.Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said on Sunday that his attacker had fired three shots before fleeing and that Korba had then travelled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the hours after the shooting. He has since been arrested and extradited. Russian state TV channel Ru-24 aired footage showing security agents escorting Korba off a plane at an unknown location.\"Investigators conducted a thorough inspection at the scene, during which they discovered the murder weapon - a Makarov pistol with a silencer and three rounds of ammunition,\" Petrenko added. Forensic tests are being carried out on the gun. Russian media, quoting Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, reported that President Vladimir Putin had thanked UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Saturday for his country's help in catching Korba.Russian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligenceUkrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha was quoted by Reuters as saying on Friday that Kyiv had nothing to do with the shooting, suggesting that it was an internal Russian affair. His Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov accused Kyiv of carrying out the attack as a way to disrupt negotiations on ending the war between the two countries, which began in February 2022. Alexeyev's boss, GRU head Adm Igor Kostyukov, has been leading the Russian delegation at recent trilateral talks with Ukraine and the US in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. Korba is alleged to have had at least one accomplice. A man named by the SK as Viktor Vasin has been arrested and charged by the authorities in Moscow.A woman named as Zinaida Serebritskaya, who has since left for Ukraine, is also thought to be involved, but Petrenko did not elaborate on how. Ukraine has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past, while Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time that it had been behind the attack.Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops.In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to the SK.Russia is also thought to have targeted high-profile Ukrainian military and political figures during the Russia-Ukraine war.Last July, Ukrainian security services said they had thwarted an attempt on the life of Serhiy Filimonov, commander of an assault unit known as the \"Da Vinci Wolves\".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has himself been subjected to numerous assassination and kidnapping plots, and Kyrylo Budanov - who until January this year was head of Ukraine's military intelligence - also says he has been targeted.",

    "body": "13 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, BangkokandThanyarat Doksone,BangkokThailand election explained as voters head to the pollsPrime Minister Anutin Charnavirakul has claimed victory in Thailand's general election, with preliminary vote counts putting his ruling conservatives well ahead of their rivals.Anutin said his success belonged to \"all Thais, no matter whether you voted for us or not\", after his party's expected result defied opinion polls that had placed the reformist People's Party ahead.With 90% of the votes counted, Anutin's Bhumjaithai party is projected to win 194 seats in Bangkok's 500-seat parliament, with the People's Party in second place on 116.People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut appeared to concede the election, saying he was ready to serve in opposition if Anutin could form a government.The election was called in December after the coalition led by Anutin collapsed after just three months.While no party is projected to gain an overall majority, Anutin is now almost certain to stay in office, with his Bhumjaithai likely to have more than double the number of seats it won in the last election in 2023.Elections in Thailand are often unpredictable, and so it proved this time. This shock result is a huge disappointment for the People's Party, which had expected to improve on its winning performance three years ago. But a widely expected \"orange wave\" of support for its young, idealistic candidates did not materialise.The party, which under a different name Move Forward won the election in 2023, but was blocked from taking power by the unelected senate, found itself pushed into second place this time by Anutin's pragmatic conservatives. The reformists will remain in opposition for now. The feared crisis that could have occurred had they won, and once again been barred from office, has been averted.ReutersPM Anutin celebrated at his party's Bangkok headquartersOpinion polls have frequently been wrong in Thailand, but there will be a lot of post-election analysis of how Anutin turned his once small, provincial Bhumjaithai - \"Thai Pride\"-  party into such a formidable electoral machine.Playing on patriotic sentiment after the two short border wars with Cambodia last year, Anutin's party became the standard-bearer for conservatives, promising to defend the status of traditional Thai institutions like the monarchy and military.He campaigned on hard-line nationalist sentiments and populist giveaways - but his victory was also down to his ability to win local power-brokers to his side, in an electoral system where 80% of seats were decided in individual constituencies on a first-past-the-post basis, with the remaining 20% allocated on the proportion of the vote won at a national level.He also broadened the appeal of his party by putting well-known technocrats with reputations for competence at the heart of his campaign.The People's Party did much better in the proportional votes, but appears to have lost some of the support it had in 2023, and was unable to overcome its lack of networks at a local level.The third main contender was the Shinawatra family and its Pheu Thai – \"For Thais\" – party, which is projected to win 86 seats, a huge drop from its 2023 result.In the past it dominated elections, with well-marketed populist policies. It formed a coalition administration after Move Forward was blocked in 2023, but had two of its prime ministers dismissed by the notoriously interventionist constitutional court. Its standing in Thailand was damaged by accusations it had mishandled the conflict with Cambodia, and by its patriarch, former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, being sent to jail last September.Getty ImagesPeople in Thailand voted in the election throughout SundayThe state of the economy was uppermost in many voters' minds, with household debt at record levels and growth far lower than in previous years.\"I want the economy to improve and I don't want big factories to relocate to our neighbouring countries,\" civil servant Phananya Bunthong told the BBC, a reference to Thailand falling behind Vietnam. The People's Party promised big changes, from curbing the power of the biggest businesses and military, to streamlining the extensive bureaucracy and modernising the education system.   In the eight years since the movement was founded its radical agenda has been popular  with younger Thais.\"I want change. I don't want things to be the same,\" 28-year-old Kittitat Daengkongkho told the BBC.But it is clear from the result that this time that agenda was less successful among older people and those in the provinces, than the simpler promises of financial assistance made by Anutin's party.Alongside the election, Thais also voted in a referendum on whether to reform the 2017 constitution, which was drafted under military rule in 2017. Critics of the charter believe it gives too much power to unelected institutions like the courts and senate, \"handcuffing\" the country's democracy.With over 90% of votes counted, preliminary tallies suggested around 65% had voted in favour.",

At about 02:28 local time, the app connected to her pacemaker, an implanted cardiac device, was disconnected from her phone.FBI Special Agent Heith Janke has said the bureau was looking into a potential ransom note sent to several media outlets.ReutersAuthorities said on Friday that they were \"aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie\" and were \"inspecting the information provided in the message for its authenticity\".Janke said the note \"had facts associated with a deadline with a monetary value they were asking for\", NBC News reported.A presenter for a local CBS News affiliate told the BBC that her channel had received the \"message\" but did not detail its contents.According to news website TMZ, which reportedly received one of the letters, the kidnappers were demanding millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency, which is popular with criminals and often difficult to trace.BBC NewsThe family has released two previous videos saying they were willing to speak to the potential kidnapper, and asking to provide proof that her mother was alive.In a video on Thursday, Camron Guthrie - the son of the missing woman - confirmed  the family had not had any direct contact with kidnappers.\"We have to know that you have our mum,\" Camron said in the family's latest video message. \"We want to talk to you.\"The FBI did arrest one individual regarding a fake ransom note on Thursday.Family, and law enforcement, have warned that Nancy Guthrie may be at risk without her medication.\"She is without any medicine,\" Savannah Guthrie said in a previous announcement. \"She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.\"Watch: What we still don’t know about the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s motherThe Pima County sheriff's office said investigators had returned to conduct \"follow-up\" at Nancy Guthrie's home on Friday as part of their investigation. They also revisited the home of Annie Guthrie, Nancy's daughter and Savannah's sister on Saturday, according to multiple US news outlets.US President Donald Trump said last week that he had spoken to Guthrie and offered federal law enforcement help.\"I think we're doing very well, meaning we have some clues, I think that are very strong and I think we could have some answers coming up fairly soon,\" he told reporters on Friday.Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday that investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive.\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" he said. \"Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes.\"Savannah Guthrie, 54, is a US broadcast journalist who has served as the co-anchor of NBC News' Today since 2012. She is also the network's chief legal correspondent and a primary anchor for its election coverage. Previously, she was NBC News' White House correspondent.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyWatch: Israel's president lays wreath at Bondi Beach to honour shooting attack victimsIsraeli President Isaac Herzog has laid a wreath and two stones from Jerusalem at Bondi Beach, the site of a shooting that targeted a Jewish festival in December, at the start of a controversial visit.\"When one Jew is hurt, all Jews feel their pain,\" he said, adding he was there to \"embrace and console the bereaved families\". Security has been tight for the four-day visit during which he will also travel to Canberra and Melbourne and meet Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.Senior Jewish leaders have said the trip will comfort a grieving community, but others have said he should not have been invited due to allegations he has incited genocide in Gaza.The president was invited by Albanese after the shooting at Bondi, in which 15 people were killed, including a 10-year-old girl, at an event celebrating Hanukkah.The prime minister has said the visit will contribute to social cohesion and a \"greater sense of unity\" after the Bondi attack but the visit is expected to be met with nationwide protests, including one in central Sydney on Monday evening.Organisers have said 5,000 people will attend the protest, which is expected to take place despite restrictions on protests brought in by the New South Wales government after the Bondi attack.Just half an hour before the protest was due to begin, the Palestine Action Group on Monday lost a legal challenge to a decision by the state government to invoke rarely used \"major event\" powers during Herzog's visit. They give police additional powers, including the ability to close specific locations, the right to search people and the imposing of fines of up to $5,500 (£2,839, US$3,862) for non-compliance.Police meanwhile said they had \"dealt with\" four people as part of their Bondi Beach operation during Herzog's visit including one man who yelled \"shame\" at Herzog and was issued with a move on direction by police under the major event act, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.Another man was arrested and charged with stalk/intimidate and behaving in an offensive manner in a public place after allegedly abusing other passengers on a bus.Getty ImagesIsraeli President Isaac Herzog and his wife Michal pay their respects to the Bondi attack victimsAlex Ryvchin, co-chair executive of Australia's peak Jewish body, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, on Monday said Herzog's visit was warmly welcomed.\"For the victim families and for the survivors [of the Bondi attack], it means a great deal,\" he said. \"His visit will lift the spirits of a pained community and we hope will lead to a much-needed recalibration of bilateral relations between two historic allies,\" he said.But other groups, including the Jewish Council of Australia (JCA), set up in 2024 to call out antisemitism and support Palestinian freedom, and the Australian National Imams Council, have said Herzog should not have been invited.\"Inviting a foreign head of state who is implicated in an ongoing genocide as a representative of the Jewish community is deeply offensive and risks entrenching the dangerous and antisemitic conflation between Jewish identity and the actions of the Israeli state,\" said JCA executive officer Sarah Schwartz last week. \"This does not make Jews safer. It does the opposite.\"On Monday, a letter organised by the JCA and signed by 600 Australian Jews was published in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, saying Herzog \"does not speak for us and is not welcome here\".Nasser Mashni, president of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, said in a post on X the visit was a \"very bitter pill to swallow\" and a \"dark day\". Asked about the planned protests on Sunday, Albanese said \"people have a right to express their views. But I do want to make this point - that President Herzog is coming in the context of the devastating antisemitic terrorist attack that occurred at Bondi.\"GettyPro-Palestinian protesters march against the visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Sydney on Sunday.He had stated that \"it's an entire nation out there that is responsible\" for the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and has also been pictured signing a shell to be dropped on Gaza. His comments formed part of the legal case brought by South Africa in the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.Herzog has condemned the UN report, which he said took his words out of context, while the Israeli foreign minister called it \"distorted and false\". The UN commission said Herzog's later clarification of his statement, that \"there are many, many innocent Palestinians who don't agree\" was \"provided to deflect responsibility for the initial statement\". Israel denies it has committed genocide in Gaza.Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer and a member of the UN commission which wrote the report, on Thursday called for Herzog to be arrested, arguing the immunity traditionally granted to heads of state should not apply to \"atrocity crimes\" such as genocide.Some federal MPs have also raised objections to the visit, while some state Labor MPs - both the state and federal government are Labor - have said they will join the Sydney march.Asked about the planned protests on Monday, Herzog said: \"I have come here in goodwill and in a message that ... Australia and Israel are close friends and allies since the days of old. \"These demonstrations in most cases, what you hear and see, comes to undermine and delegitimise our right, my nation's right ... of its mere existence and it's contradictory to whatever was said and done by Australia.\"He also said the \"current rise in antisemitism around the world is a global emergency\" adding: \"Hatred that starts with the Jews never ends with the Jews\".",

    "body": "From classroom to camera: A teacher who has become a sensation in Indian cinema1 day agoSudha G TilakBBCIn Eko, a Malayalam-language film, Momin plays an enigmatic elder living alone At 70, Biana Watre Momin took a leap far from home. The retired college teacher left the Garo Hills in north-eastern India's Meghalaya state, where she led a quiet family life - caring for four dogs and doting on her grandchildren - and travelled more than 3,000km (1,864 miles) south to Kerala to act in a film.She was dealing with a language she did not understand, embracing a role whose meaning would only reveal itself once the camera began to roll.The film was Eko, a Malayalam-language film that would change the course of her life.For Momin, a member of the Garo tribe - one of the indigenous communities of Meghalaya, a largely tribal state - acting had never been an ambition, or even a distant curiosity. \"Growing up, my town did not have a cinema or theatre,\" she told the BBC. She was never trained in the performing arts, \"unless you'd call teaching in a classroom a kind of performance\", she adds with a laugh.A retired English literature teacher from Tura Government College, with a fondness for Romantic poetry, Momin had little reason to believe that a camera would one day frame her face. Yet when Eko entered her life, it offered an unexpected adventure.\"I was initially hesitant as I had no experience in acting and was concerned about the long travel from home,\" she says. \"But my daughter nudged me, saying, 'Have faith in yourself and try something new.'\"Momin's character lives in a crumbling house, sharing her world with feral dogs In Eko, a title that plays on the word \"echo\", Momin plays Mlathi Chettathi, an enigmatic elder living alone in the Western Ghats, a vast mountain range along India's western coast known for its dense forests and mist-covered hills. As the film's lead, her presence anchors its fog-laced landscape and moral core.Shot on a modest budget and completed in 45 days, Eko, showing on Netflix, has emerged as a critical success.Much of the intrigue surrounding the film centres on Momin's performance, both for its quiet power and for her unusual profile.Director Dinjith Ayyathan was searching for a fresh face to play an elderly Malay woman who flees Malaysia during the Japanese invasion of World War II and arrives in Kerala accompanied by men with hidden motives. Over decades, she lives alone in a crumbling house atop a forested mountain, sharing her world with feral dogs and drifting clouds, while men claiming friendship and family ties attempt to unravel the mystery around her.The search for the right actor led the Eko team to reach out to friends in the fledgeling film industry and even the Indian army stationed across the eight north-eastern states, looking for someone whose features might plausibly pass as Malay.It was then that images and clips of Momin, who had recently appeared in a short film on Garo folklore exploring the transformation of human souls into animals, found their way to the Kerala-based scouting team.Eko was shot in India's forested Western Ghats\"It seems an unusual coincidence that a short film involving animals led me to a role also set in the company of animals,\" Momin says.On a rainy day, she travelled with her son to meet the director and writer for an audition.\"We gave her a fictitious situation: approaching police officers to report her missing son,\" says Eko's writer and cinematographer Bahul Ramesh. \"Her spontaneity, emotive restraint and quiet confidence stood out immediately. Her courage to move far from home and attempt something entirely new at this age won us over.\"Though often described as an eco-mystery or psychological thriller, Eko resists easy categorisation - and so does Mlathi Chettathi. She is neither ornament nor mystical cliché. Instead, she carries a quiet authority, observant and grounded.\"I am proud, as an indigenous person, that there are creative people willing to take a chance on me at this age,\" Momin says. \"I hope it inspires more representation.\"Eko has been described as a psychological thrillerRamesh describes her performance as \"organic and intuitive\". \"What was extraordinary was her fearlessness and stepping onto a film set for the first time at 70,\" he says.For Momin, the shoot was an education. \"Suddenly, I was a student again,\" she says. She learnt her Malayalam lines phonetically with help from a language coach, followed position cues, absorbed emotional beats and adapted to the rhythm of a professional film set.Although her dialogue was later dubbed by a local voice artist, Momin memorised and delivered her lines during filming. The shoot involved long treks up a mountain each day, unpredictable weather, veteran actors, heavy equipment and frequent rushes to beat the rain and descending clouds.\"I am a strong woman,\" she says. \"I didn't fall sick despite the weather, and I was adventurous enough to try the cuisine in Kerala.\"Biana Watre MominMomin is a retired English literature teacher from a government collegeCrew members say they were struck by her sharp grasp of emotion, angles and movement. Momin credits her life experience. \"I have lived a full life and could draw from that,\" she says. \"I also come from a matrilineal tribe, similar to Kerala, and my feminism informed my approach to the role.\"Ramesh agrees. \"This is a self-reliant character who outwits those trying to exploit her with silent grit and steely determination. Momin slipped into this feminist folklore with quiet understanding.\"Accolades have followed her, with national award-winning Tamil actor Dhanush calling it a \"world-class performance\".Following Eko's success, filmmakers from Bollywood and beyond have approached Momin with scripts. \"Talks are on,\" she says carefully. \"Acting is strenuous work. Let's see what surprises are in store.\"For the time being, Momin has returned to her life at home, keeping busy with her family and her book club. \"We'll be discussing Arundhati Roy's Mother Mary Comes to Me this week,\" she says cheerfully.    Biana Momin did not become an actor in the conventional sense. What she became instead was a reminder that cinema, at its best, does not manufacture truth but learns to recognise it.\"Old age should burn and rage at close of day,\" she quotes Dylan Thomas, momentarily sounding like the teacher she once was.",

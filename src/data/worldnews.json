    "body": "5 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykUS Department of Justice/PAEpstein took dozens more flights to the UK than were previously knownEssex Police has said it is assessing information about private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the Epstein files.The BBC understands that while the police is \"assessing\" the information, it would not necessarily lead to a full investigation.Last year a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived at or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police \"urgently\" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein's victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.An Essex Police spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\"In December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale\" investigation into his activities in the UK.The former PM wrote to the chief police constables and commissioner of the Met, Essex and Thames Valley Police.He added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".Stansted Airport said in a statement: \"All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent Fixed Base Operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.\"The airport said that these terminals are \"entirely independent\" and that \"no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal\". Immigration and customs checks for passengers arriving via private jets are carried out \"directly by Border Force\", it said, adding that it does not \"manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft\".The Essex Police statement comes as a new national group has been set up to support UK forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has said.The force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK's trade envoy.The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.He was dismissed from his role as ambassador in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.",

Four other people were slightly hurt in the blaze.The identities of those who died is not yet known but reports said they include children and none of them lived in the building.It is not clear why they could not escape the storage room, which is on the upper floor, according to firefighters. An investigation is under way into the fire's cause.  The grandfather of one of the young victims told La Vanguardia that the boys used the storage room, which is thought to have been converted into a living space, to meet each other. No official details have been confirmed about the victims but witnesses told local media that they were aged between 14 and 18.The local authority said it was providing support to the victims and it declared three days of mourning.Catalan President Salvador Illa Roca said he was shocked by the deaths and expressed his deepest condolences to families and friends.",

    "body": "10 hours agoWatch: High school hockey players recount Rhode Island ice rink shootingPolice have identified the suspect in a shooting at a high school ice hockey game in Rhode Island that killed two people and injured three others.Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said Robert Dorgan, who also used the name Roberta and the surname Esposito, died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the Dennis M Lynch Arena on Sunday.\"It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,\" Goncalves said. She did not provide details about the identity of the victims.Video of the incident showed shots were fired while players were on the rink, sparking panic as the teams scrambled to leave the arena.Getty ImagesThe shooting happened at the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, about five miles (8km) north of the state capital, ProvidenceGoncalves said a bystander \"stepped in and interjected\" and \"that's probably what led to a swift end of this tragic event\".After the incident, hockey players and their families described their fear after gunfire broke out. Melissa Dunn, whose son played for one of the hockey teams, said she saw paramedics performing CPR in the stands of the arena after she ran back inside to find her son. \"You don't know what's going on at first,\" Dunn said. \"You just hear the loud noises. And we're used to the kids banging on the board with their skates, so we thought it was that at first.\"She said she screamed for her son to duck and avoid gunfire. \"We ran out of the rink… your first thought is 'where's my kid?'\" she said. \"I tried to get back in the rink, and I actually got back in there to find out where he was, and I saw them doing CPR in the stands and it was just really disturbing.\"Olin Lawrence, a high school hockey player who was on the ice at the time of the shooting, told reporters he ran inside the locker room when he heard shots being fired.\"I went down and then I ran,\" he said. \"We pressed against the door and just tried to stay safe down in there. It was very scary. We were very nervous. It was a lot of shots.\"The shooting happened at the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, about five miles (8km) north of the state capital, Providence, and about 45 miles south of Boston.\"Our state is grieving again,\" Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said, referring to a shooting in December at Brown University. \"As governor, a parent and a former coach, my heart breaks for the victims, families and everyone impacted by the devastating shooting at Lynch Arena in Pawtucket.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisAFP via Getty ImagesNine people have been arrested in France following an investigation into the murder of a far-right nationalist student by suspected militants from the far-left.Those detained include a parliamentary assistant for a deputy from the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) party.Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old maths student, died in hospital on Saturday - two days after being beaten and kicked about the head by a gang of masked young men in Lyon.It happened after a small demonstration by far-right feminists - who Deranque was supposed to be helping protect - at the city's Institute of Political Studies (IEP), commonly known as Sciences-Po. The arrests confirm what has widely been reported: that those suspected of the murder are far-left militants linked to a banned group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard). The most striking news is that among the nine in custody is Jacques-Elie Favrot, a young man who until now has been employed as parliamentary assistant at the National Assembly in Paris for a deputy from LFI.The murder is putting huge pressure on LFI, on its 70 MPs, and on its veteran leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is a likely contender in next year's presidential election.On Sunday, Mélenchon said his party had \"nothing to do with this story. Those who accuse us are committing a libel.\"We express our consternation, but also our empathy and compassion for [Deranque's] family and friends. We have said dozens of times that we oppose all forms of violence,\" he said.On Monday, state prosecutor Thierry Dran told a news conference that Deranque was kicked and punched by \"at least six\" individuals, and that the post-mortem examination showed fatal damage to his skull and brain.",

    "body": "Stephen Colbert says CBS spiked interview with Democrat over FCC fears1 hour agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesLate-night host Stephen Colbert has accused his network of refusing to broadcast his interview with a Democratic politician over fears of retaliation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).CBS, the network which hosts the programme, denies that it \"prohibited\" the interview from being aired, saying it gave only \"legal guidance\". On his Monday night show, Colbert said that CBS wouldn't show his interview with Texas lawmaker James Talarico out of concerns of a response from the FCC, which has new guidance on equal airtime for political candidates.\"We were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,\" he said.\"Then, then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.\"Colbert, host of The Late Show, went on to explain that new FCC guidance on the \"equal time\" rule - which requires TV and radio broadcasters to give equal time to rival political candidates - could have created legal trouble for the network, according to CBS lawyers.The FCC regulates radio, TV and satellite airwaves, giving it power over a range of matters, including mergers and decency complaints.CBS flatly denied Colbert's claims in a statement on Tuesday.\"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep James Talarico,\" the network said.The statement added: \"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates... and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. \"The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.\"The full interview was later posted on YouTube, where FCC rules don't apply.News content has traditionally been exempted from the \"equal time\" rule.But the FCC has said the rule may soon apply to late-night programmes, like Colbert's. It may also apply to political radio programmes, which tend to skew Republican.After issuing the new guidance in January, Brendan Carr, the FCC chairman known for taking an expansive view of his power, said on X that \"for years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. \"Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\" Trump has at times said he is considering pulling the FCC license for several US networks who he says have aired views that are critical of his presidency. Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, last July agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute with President Donald Trump regarding an interview it broadcast on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.Business commentators have said the deal was made partly so as to not affect Paramount's planned merger with Skydance Media, which Trump had the power to halt.Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC, condemned the response by CBS, saying it had the First Amendment constitutional right to free speech.\"This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech,\" Gomez said in a statement, adding that the FCC has \"no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes\".She continued: \"It is no secret that Paramount, CBS's parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.\"She has previously accused the FCC's Republican leaders of using the equal time rule to unfairly penalise critics in violation of the constitutional right to free speech. The Late Show is due to end it's 33-year run in May. Colbert has been the host since 2015.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDearbail JordanBusiness reporterEPAThe European Union (EU) has launched a formal investigation into fast fashion giant Shein over possible breaches of digital law, including the sale of childlike sex dolls.The European Commission (EC), the EU's executive arm, said it will examine what systems the Chinese firm has in place to prevent the sale of illegal products \"including content which could constitute child sexual abuse material\".It will also investigate the \"addictive design\" of Shein's platform and the transparency of the system it uses to suggest products and content to shoppers.Shein said: \"Protecting minors and reducing the risk of harmful content and behaviours are central to how we develop and operate our platform.\"Last year, Shein was reported to French authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website.The firm said it removed the products immediately, banned the sellers, and removed the sale of sex dolls \"regardless of appearance\" across its global site. It also said it worked with local and international authorities on investigations into both the buyers and sellers of the childlike sex dolls.The Commission said it will investigate the systems Shein uses to limit the sale of illegal products. It said that would include weapons but declined to specify particular items.It has sent a number of requests for information to Shein in the past and EC spokesperson Thomas Regnier told the BBC's World Business Report that Shein was \"very cooperative\". But the EC said that once there were indications that a platform may have systemic risks for its users, the EC could open proceedings to investigate further.Regnier said the EC was concerned about the \"addictive\" nature of Shein's website, and the \"gamification\" of the platform, including its \"rewards programme\" for consumers.He said that the Commission was not against reward programmes per se, but that online platform algorithms were \"often opaque\".\"You don't know how they're being designed [and] you're not in control of what you see,\" he said.The EC will also examine the transparency of so-called \"recommender systems\" which use a shopper's data to push certain products their way. It said that under the Digital Services Act (DSA), Shein must disclosed the main parameters it uses to recommend products and must provide users with \"at least one easily accessible option\" that is not based on using their data to profile their likely purchases. Opening a formal investigation into a company means that the EC can take \"enforcement steps\" such as fines of up to 6% of a company's global sales. In the most recent figures available, Shein reported $38bn in sales for 2024.A spokesperson for Shein said: \"Over the last few months, we have continued to invest significantly in measures to strengthen our compliance with the DSA. \"These include comprehensive systemic-risk assessments and mitigation frameworks, enhanced protections for younger users, and ongoing work to design our services in ways that promote a safe and trusted user experience,\" it said.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterGetty ImagesA glove discovered as part of the investigation into Nancy Guthrie's kidnapping has produced no DNA matches, authorities in Pima County, Arizona, say. Found approximately two miles from Guthrie's home, the glove appeared to match one that can be seen on the hand of a suspect in doorbell-camera footage taken the night she went missing.DNA from the glove was sent for testing on Thursday, but produced no matches in CODIS, the FBI's database of DNA from known offenders. Nancy Guthrie, the 84 year-old mother of news anchor Savannah Guthrie, has been missing since 1 February, when investigators believe she was taken from her home against her will. The family has made repeated pleas for her return.The FBI said on Sunday that investigators recovered the glove from a field near the side of the road about two miles (3 km) from Guthrie's home near Tucson, Arizona.The agency collected about 16 gloves from various locations near Nancy Guthrie's home, although most turned out to have been discarded by people searching for her.Last week, investigators released video footage taken from a doorbell camera at Guthrie's front door that showed a masked man wearing gloves and a backpack.In the video, the suspect walks toward the camera and tries to cover it with his gloved hand before grabbing some brush from the front yard to block the camera's view.After conducting a forensic analysis of the video, the FBI said it believed the man was between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall with an average build.More than two weeks since Guthrie was reported missing, no arrests have been made, the sheriff's department confirmed on Tuesday. However, authorities noted that more DNA found in the residence is being analysed - and that they are exploring other \"investigative genetic genealogy\" databases for DNA matches.The sheriff's department shared that it is working with Walmart to determine who purchased the backpack worn by the suspect in the video. Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homePolice said over the weekend that the Guthrie family, including Nancy Guthrie's children and their spouses, are not suspects in her abduction. Guthrie's three children have posted multiple videos pleading for their mother's safe return in the two weeks since her disappearance, saying they are willing to pay her abductors. Over the weekend, Savannah Guthrie posted one addressing a potential kidnapper directly. \"It is never too late to do the right thing,\" she said. \"We are here and...we believe in the essential goodness of every human being.\"Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her daughter Annie Guthrie's house.Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.A massive search operation has involved both the Pima County Sheriff's Department and the FBI, who have been combing through Guthrie's home and the surrounding areas.Officials have warned that Guthrie needs regular medication and is \"not in good physical health\". They have said she has no reported cognitive issues.Police have also found blood on the floor of Guthrie's porch - which was confirmed to be hers.The FBI has increased the reward for information about her disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesThe oil tanker, named Grinch, under the watch of the French navy near MarseilleFrance says it has released an oil tanker suspected of being part of Russia's sanctions-busting \"shadow fleet\" after its owner paid a fine.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the vessel, Grinch, was \"leaving French waters\" on Tuesday having paid a penalty of \"several million euros\".The tanker was seized by French forces in the Mediterranean in January and then diverted to the port city of Marseille. It had set sail from Murmansk in northern Russia and was flying under a Comoros flag, officials said.Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by using aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance.Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian oil after it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\"Circumventing European sanctions comes at a price. Russia will no longer be able to finance its war with impunity through a ghost fleet off our coasts,\" Barrot said in a post on X.He added: \"The tanker Grinch will leave French waters after shelling out several million euros and three weeks of costly immobilisation at Fos-sur-Mer. Let's keep it up.\"\"As part of a guilty plea procedure the company that owns the vessel was sentenced by the Marseille judicial court to a financial penalty of confiscation,\" the public prosecutor's office and regional maritime authorities said in a statement.The exact amount the vessel's owner was fined was unclear.While estimates vary, data from the monitoring group TankerTrackers.com suggests the fleet currently consists of 1,468 vessels, roughly triple its size at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago.The vessels tend to be old and are often poorly maintained. Details of ownership and management are deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are frequently changed.Efforts have been stepped up to tackle shadow fleets in recent months and a number of sanctioned tankers have been seized.Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.More on this story",

    "body": "7 hours agoWatch: Jesse Jackson's life in civil rights, diplomacy, and politicsUS civil rights leader Jesse Jackson died aged 84 on Tuesday morning surrounded by relatives, according to a statement released by his family. \"It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Civil Rights leader and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Honorable Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr,\" the family said, adding he died \"peacefully.\"  His cause of death has not been released, but Jackson had been diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy and was in hospital late last year.Tributes poured in for the prominent activist who twice ran to be Democrats' presidential nominee, including from the first black US president, Barack Obama.Jackson is survived by his wife Jacqueline and their children: Santita, Jesse Jr, Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline and Ashley. In their statement, Jackson's family said his \"unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and human rights helped shape a global movement for freedom and dignity\". \"A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless from his Presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilising millions to register to vote - leaving an indelible mark on history,\" they added.Along with working with Martin Luther King, Jr, and running for president in 1984 and 1988, Jackson is remembered as the founder of a nonprofit organisation focused on social justice and civil rights, the Rainbow PUSH coalition.Calling Jackson a \"true giant\", Obama said in a statement that Jackson's \"two historic runs for president\" had \"laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land\". Obama added that his wife Michelle \"got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager\".\"For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history,\" the Obamas also said in the statement. \"From organizing boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect.\"Jackson was admitted to hospital last November, and doctors said he had been diagnosed with a rare degenerative condition called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in April 2025, revising an earlier diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease that Jackson had said was made in 2015.Both diseases affect the brain, nervous system, and muscle control and, according to the American Parkinson Disease Association and the group CurePSP, many people with PSP are initially diagnosed with Parkinson's because a number of the symptoms overlap. Born in 1941 in Greenville, South Carolina, Jackson became involved in politics at an early age. He rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leader in Martin Luther King, Jr 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was with King when he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968.Over the course of his career, Jackson built a movement to bring America's increasingly diverse population together, with a message that centred on poor and working-class Americans.After his presidential runs, Jackson later positioned himself as an elder statesman within the Democratic Party.His son Jesse Jackson, Jr is a former US congressman.Getty ImagesJackson was remembered by politicians and friends as an agent of change and a transformative leaderShortly after his death was announced, politicians and other public figures took to social media to mourn the loss of Jackson. US President Donald Trump said he knew Jackson \"long before becoming president\". \"He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and 'street smarts,'\" Trump said. \"He was very gregarious - Someone who truly loved people!\"Former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, a former secretary of state, also shared tributes, saying they were friends with Jackson for \"almost fifty years\".\"Reverend Jackson championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives,\" they said in a statement. House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Jackson \"was a legendary voice for the voiceless,\" in a tribute to the late civil rights leader posted on X.\"For decades, while laboring in the vineyards of the community, he inspired us to keep hope alive in the struggle for liberty and justice for all,\" the Democrat said.New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the civil rights leader \"never stopped demanding that America live up to its promise\".\"He marched, he ran, he organized and he preached justice without apology,\" Mamdani said. King's daughter Bernice said Jackson had \"devoted his life to lifting people in poverty, the marginalized, and those pushed to society's edges\". Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, who worked closely with Jackson during the civil rights movement, said Jackson was a \"consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world\". \"He told us we were somebody and made us believe. I will always cherish him taking me under his wing, and I will forever try to do my part to keep hope alive,\" Sharpton said. Watch: BBC interviews Jesse Jackson in Birmingham in 2013",

I've got combat experience, that's kind of rare. I spent 25 years in the military,\" he said.He added: \"It's a serious decision. I just haven't made it yet.\"Kelly, 61, and five other lawmakers, who had all either served in the military or had roles in intelligence, have been targeted by the government after they published a 90-second video encouraging troops to disobey orders they deemed illegal. It was released at the time of rising questions of the legality regarding American strikes on alleged narco-trafficking boats off the coast of South America.But Kelly said he expected Trump to continue his legal action against him.He added: \"This is not going to end by me going away. I'm going to continue to fight this thing even if it goes all the way to the Supreme Court.\"Critics of the Trump administration have called the government's crackdown on the six lawmakers an attack on free speech and said it was another instance of the president seeking to punish those he perceives as political enemies.\"Donald Trump, is so reckless about what he says,\" he said. \"There are folks out there that, you know, react to what he said and people listen to him.\"The BBC has contacted the White House for comment.Among the other Democrats considering a presidential run are Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in 2024, and California Governor Gavin Newsom. Ina BBC interview in October, Harris said she would \"possibly\" be president one day and was confident there would be a woman in the White House in future.However, he has also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoHafsa KhalilandLaura GozziState Emergency Service of Ukraine/Anadolu via Getty ImagesUkrainian firefighters search through the rubble after Russian attacks on residential areas of the north-eastern Ukrainian city of SumyRussian and Ukrainian delegations have ended the first day of US-brokered peace talks in Geneva, a week before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov said the negotiations would continue in the Swiss city on Wednesday morning.Hopes for a breakthrough during the latest - third - round of trilateral talks are low, as the Kremlin has not wavered from its maximalist demands for Ukrainian territory.Russian strikes on Ukraine continue on a nightly basis, further damaging the country's already battered power grid as subzero temperatures continue.Just hours before the delegations met in Geneva, Russia carried out a large combined aerial attack on Ukraine, hitting 12 regions with 400 drones and almost 30 missiles. At least three people were killed, Ukrainian officials said.Meanwhile, Russia said its air defences had repelled more than 150 drones, while an oil refinery caught on fire after a Ukrainian drone strike.Rustem Umerov/TelegramUkraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov posted a photo of the teams from Ukraine (right), Russia (left) and the US (centre) at the start of the talks in GenevaIn a statement on social media on Tuesday evening, Umerov, Ukraine's top security official, said the talks focused on \"practical issues and the mechanics of possible solutions\".He said he would now inform Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the results.In his video address shortly afterwards, Zelensky said Ukraine was ready to refrain from carrying out strikes as earlier proposed by the US to both Kyiv and Moscow.\"We don't need war,\" he said, stressing that Ukrainians were \"defending our state, our independence\".\"We are also ready to quickly move towards a worthy agreement to end the war. The question is only for the Russians: what do they want?\"Meanwhile, Russia's state RIA news agency quoted a source saying that Tuesday's negotiations, which lasted six hours, had been tense and took place in different bilateral and trilateral formats. The talks are being mediated by Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's special envoy, and Jared Kushner, the US president's son-in-law.On the Russian side, President Vladimir Putin's aide Vladimir Medinsky is the top negotiator.Both Ukraine and Russia also had senior military figures in their teams.Ahead of the talks, Trump said Ukraine had \"better come to the table fast.\"He has previously signalled his impatience with the lack of swift progress in solving the four-year conflict. Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including large parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over the rest of the region, which Ukraine has ruled out. For Ukraine, robust security guarantees from the West - including the US - must come before any settlement with Russia can be agreed.In Kyiv, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhiha condemned the overnight Russian strikes, saying they showed the \"extent to which Russia disregards peace efforts\".At least three energy workers were killed near the frontline city of Slovyansk in Monday's overnight attacks, Ukraine's deputy Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said. A further nine people - including children - were injured across the country, President Zelensky said. More than 10 residential buildings were damaged, with railway infrastructure also damaged. \"Russia must be held to account for its aggression,\" he wrote on X, adding: \"For peace to be real and just, action must target the sole source of this aggression\".Kyiv said 12 regions were hit, damaging infrastructure and leaving thousands without power in the southern port city of Odesa. DTEK, the country's largest private energy firm, said power infrastructure in the city had suffered \"incredibly serious\" damage, adding it would take a long time to return to a working condition. Ukraine is facing an acute energy crisis after months of relentless Russian attacks on its infrastructure and as it struggles through a freezing winter. It launched its own volley of attacks on Russia overnight. Officials said a fire broke out at the Ilsky oil refinery in the southern Krasnodar region after a drone strike. A reservoir storing oil products also caught fire.The border region of Belgorod continued to come under attack, with Ukraine launching dozens of drones and causing significant damage of power infrastructure. These latest discussions follow last month's trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, which were the first three-way between Russia, Ukraine and the US since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.They ended with no breakthrough - although the first prisoner of war exchanges in months took place shortly after.Additional reporting by Jaroslav Lukiv",

    "body": "Family of Zambia's ex-President Lungu dismiss poisoning allegation - lawyers8 hours agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgPhotothek/Getty ImagesEdgar Lungu's body remains in South Africa as a legal battle over his burial continuesThe family of ex-Zambian President Edgar Lungu, who died in South Africa last June and is yet to be buried, have dismissed allegations he was poisoned.South African police also want custody of his body as part of their investigations, according to the late politician's family.In a letter to the police, seen by the BBC, their lawyers say the family are co-operating with \"criminal proceedings\", but maintain the allegations are \"unfounded and unsupported by credible evidence\".It is the latest twist over the fate of Lungu's body, which remains in a morgue in South Africa and has been subject to an ongoing legal battle between his family and Zambia's government over where he should be buried.South Africa's police service has refused to comment on the letter sent by the Johannesburg law firm Mashele Attorneys, which is representing the Lungu family.Police spokesperson Brig Athlenda Mathe told the BBC: \"This is a very sensitive matter that cannot be discussed at this stage.\"Lungu died of an undisclosed illness aged 68 at a clinic in South Africa's capital, Pretoria. He had led Zambia from 2015 until 2021, when he lost elections by a huge margin to current President Hakainde Hichilema.The Zambian government wants Lungu's remains to be repatriated and given a state funeral, with full state honours - and a South African court ruled in its favour in August.But Lungu's family want a private burial in South Africa as they say the former president had not wanted Hichilema to attend his funeral. The relationship between the two politicians had long been fraught.In the letter to the South African police, dated 11 February 2026, Mashele Attorneys confirmed that on behalf of the Lungu family it had \"complied with the five subpoenas issued\" in relation to a criminal probe looking into allegations that the former Zambian president was poisoned.\"For the avoidance of doubt, it is our clients' instruction that the allegations underlying the criminal case are denied,\" the letter said.Neo Mashele, from Mashele Attorneys, told the BBC the investigation by police appeared to be based on a \"public utterance\" about a poisoning allegation made by one of Lungu's daughters that was \"absolutely not true\".In its letter, Mashele Attorneys also raised concern over another subpoena it said had been issued by police to the funeral home looking after Lungu's body.It said there were two High Court orders that directed that \"possession and custody of the body remain with Two Mountains Funeral Services pending the finalisation of the legal proceedings\".\"Those orders are binding and operative,\" the letter said.An official from the morgue where the remains are being stored told the BBC that Lungu's body was \"under tight security [and] surveillance 24/7\".Mrs Lungu has remained in South Africa since the death of her husband and is leading legal efforts to have him buried in South Africa.Additional reporting by Nomsa MasekoYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "45 minutes agoBethany BellVienna correspondentwww.foto-webcam.euWebcam footage shows a clear image of the boyfriend with a torch descending from the peakMore than a year after a 33-year-old woman froze to death on Austria's highest mountain, her boyfriend goes on trial on Thursday accused of gross negligent manslaughter.Kerstin G died of hypothermia on a mountain climbing trip to the Grossglockner that went horribly wrong. Her boyfriend is accused of leaving her unprotected and exhausted close to the summit in stormy conditions in the early hours of 19 January 2025, while he went to get help.The trial has sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders.Prosecutors say that, as the more experienced climber, the man on trial was \"the responsible guide for the tour\" and failed to turn back or call for support in time to help his girlfriend.Identified by Austrian media as Thomas P,  he denies the charges and his lawyer, Karl Jelinek, has described the woman's death as \"a tragic accident.\"The tragedy unfolded after the couple began their climb of the 3,798m (12,460ft) Grossglockner.Prosecutors accuse Thomas P of making mistakes from the outset and have published a list of 9 errors.At stake is the question of when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability. If the climber is found guilty it could mean \"a paradigm shift for mountain sports\", says Austria's Der Standard newspaper.Key to the case is the charge by state prosecutors in Innsbruck that he was to be considered the \"responsible guide for the tour\", as \"unlike his girlfriend [he was] already very experienced in high-altitude Alpine tours and had planned the tour\".Grossglockner mountain in AustriaThey said he attempted the trip even though his girlfriend had \"never undertaken an Alpine tour of this length, difficulty, and altitude, and despite the challenging winter conditions\".They also allege he started out two hours too late and had failed to take \"enough emergency bivouac equipment\".He also \"allowed his girlfriend to use... snowboard soft boots, equipment that is not suitable for a high-altitude tour in mixed terrain\", say prosecutors.The defendant disputes this. In a statement, his lawyer Karl Jelinek, said the couple had planned the tour together.\"Both considered themselves... to be sufficiently experienced, adequately prepared, and well equipped,\" he said. Both had \"relevant Alpine experience\" and were \"in very good physical condition\".Once on the mountain, prosecutors say the man should have turned back, when it was still possible, because of strong winds of up to 74km/h (45mph), and the winter cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20, they said.The couple did not turn back.Accounts of what happened next differ.According to the defendant's lawyer, they reached a place called Frühstücksplatz at 13:30 on 18 January, the point of the tour after which there was no turning back before the summit.As neither of them was \"exhausted or overwhelmed, they continued on\", Karl Jelinek said.Prosecutors say the couple got stuck at about 20:50 and that the man failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:50.The boyfriend's lawyer said at that point his client and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.www.foto-webcam.euThis still from webcam footage shows the couple still climbing at 21:00 on 18 JanuaryBut shortly afterwards, Mr Jelinek said the situation changed dramatically. To the man's \"complete surprise\", the woman \"suddenly showed increased signs of exhaustion\", although by then turning back was too late.At 00:35 on 19 January, he called mountain police. The content of the conversation is unclear but the lawyer says he asked for help and denies telling police that everything was fine. Police allege he then put his phone on silent and did not take any more calls.Karl Jelinek says the couple managed to reach an area about 40m (130ft) below the cross marking the summit of the Grossglockner. As the defendant's girlfriend was too exhausted to move, he left her to find help, scaling the summit and descending on the other side, he says.  Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00am.His torchlit figure is captured on webcam images as he descended from the summit.Prosecutors say he did not use aluminium rescue blankets or other gear to protect her from the cold and waited until 03:30 before notifying emergency services.By that point it was most probably too late. The strong winds meant that no helicopter rescue could take place during the night.Kerstin G died alone in the snow on the frozen mountainside.If found guilty, Thomas P faces up to three years in prison.And a guilty verdict could also have implications for other mountain climbers, and how much they could be liable for their companions in the future.Bergrettung KalsPoor weather meant mountain rescue teams were unable to reach the scene until the morning (file pic)",

    "body": "4 hours agoPeter Bowes,North America correspondentandChris GrahamReutersThe talks are taking place in the Omani mission building in GenevaIran has said it has reached an understanding with the US on the main \"guiding principles\" to resolve their dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme.Speaking after indirect talks in Geneva, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi added that work still needed to be done. The US said \"progress was made\".Badr Albusaidi, foreign minister of mediator Oman, said the negotiations \"concluded with good progress towards identifying common goals and relevant  technical issues\". The meeting followed repeated US military threats against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. President Donald Trump had earlier said he believed Iran wanted to make a deal.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Before Tuesday's talks at the residence of Oman's ambassador in the Swiss city, Iran stated that it would focus on its nuclear programme and the potential lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the US. Washington has previously indicated it wanted to discuss other issues as well, such as Iran's missile development.It was not immediately known what range of issues were discussed in Geneva but a US official told the BBC: \"Progress was made, but there are still a lot of details to discuss. The Iranians said they would come back in the next two weeks with detailed proposals to address some of the open gaps in our positions.\"When asked about the talks in an interview with Fox News, US Vice-President JD Vance said: \"In some ways, it went well; they agreed to meet afterwards. But in other ways, it was very clear that the president has set some red lines that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through.\"Framing the talks as \"very important\", US President Donald Trump had earlier said he would be \"indirectly\" involved and suggested Tehran was motivated this time to negotiate. \"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that Iran learned the consequences of a tough posture in talks last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites. \"We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s,\" he said, referring to the stealth bombers that carried out the bombings. \"I hope they're going to be more reasonable.\"Trump's threats come amid a US military build-up in the Middle East over the past few weeks. The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, which could arrive in the region within the next three weeks.Speaking on Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded to Trump's threats of military action by saying: \"More dangerous than an aircraft carrier is the weapon that can send it to the bottom of the sea.\"He says the US's army is the strongest army in the world. The 'strongest army in the world' may sometimes receive such a blow that it cannot get back up.\"Khamenei also accused the US of attempting to predetermine the outcome of negotiations and said that would be a \"wrong and foolish thing to do\".In addition to the Abraham Lincoln's arrival, BBC Verify has also tracked an increase of US destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets in the region.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday, saying in a post on X he was in Geneva to \"achieve a fair and equitable deal\".\"What is not on the table: submission before threats,\" Araghchi said.ReutersThe US military released an image of the Lincoln carrier strike group in the Arabian Sea in FebruaryIran has responded to the US build-up with its own show of force. On Monday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran. The Strait is considered a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that reaching a deal with Tehran would be \"very difficult\".\"I think that there's an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement... but I don't want to overstate it either,\" Rubio said during a visit to Hungary. \"It's going to be hard.\"Additional reporting by Ghoncheh Habibiazad, BBC Persian",

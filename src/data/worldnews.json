    "body": "2 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesIrwin competed in the final despite having a rib injuryRobert Irwin, son of the late conservationist Steve Irwin, has been crowned this year's winner of Dancing with the Stars, a decade after his older sister Bindi won the same title. The popular US dancing competition sees stars paired with professional dancers to perform in front of a panel of judges, with the audience also voting on their favourite couple.The 21-year-old was favoured to win, with strong performances over the show's 11 weeks, including a tribute to his father and a surprise appearance from his sister Bindi. With a legion of fans in the US, Irwin's finale had an Australian bent with one dance choreographed to a song by Australian rock band Jet.During the three-hour finale on Tuesday evening, local time, Irwin and his dance partner Witney Carson also performed to songs by Avicii and Sydney-born Sam Sparro.They then triumphed in the \"instant dance challenge\" – where Irwin and Carson were told the style and song minutes before taking to the stage.Irwin, who competed in the final despite having a rib injury, beat fellow finalists including influencer Alix Earle and Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles.This came despite three contestants - not including Irwin - earning a perfect score of 30 for their first dances. However, Irwin got a perfect score not long after.Getty ImagesThe pair triumphed in the \"instant dance challenge\"He broke down in tears after his final performance, saying that said he wanted to make his father proud.\"I wish he could see it, I really wish he could be here,\" he said.Steve Irwin was famous for his TV wildlife shows which regularly saw him handling crocodiles and led to him being dubbed the \"Crocodile Hunter\".He was killed by a stingray during a diving expedition off the Australian coast in 2006, when Robert was just a baby. Following his father's love for wildlife, Robert Irwin has long been a keen photographer and recently became an Earthshot ambassador.",

    "body": "A parking inspector and his wife have been arrested on suspicion of embezzling more than €1m (£878,000) from a small German town's parking meters.The unnamed municipal employee is thought to have taken coins out of parking meters in Kempten \"on numerous occasions\" and placed them in bank accounts that his wife had access to, local police said in a statement.A money laundering report by a credit institution alerted investigators to the suspected theft. The inspector faces charges relating to 720 alleged incidents of theft, while his wife faces charges of aiding and abetting theft, also in 720 cases.Kempten Mayor Thomas Kiechle said he was \"stunned and dismayed\" by the allegations. In October, the Kempten public prosecutor's office was informed that cash was repeatedly being deposited into several bank accounts, according to the German news agency DPA.Police then searched office premises in the early hours of 24 November, the same day that the 40-year-old man and 38-year old woman were arrested.They are now being held in separate detention facilities.It is not clear how long it might have taken the couple to accrue the sum.In response to the allegations, Kiechle announced the appointment of a commission to \"review past work processes, uncover potential weaknesses, and reliably remedy them for the future.\"Kiechle noted that the names of the couple could not currently be released due to the ongoing investigation and privacy concerns.In a written statement, Kiechle said: \"I naturally support the public prosecutor's office and the police in their thorough investigation of the allegations.\"\"Until the proceedings are concluded, the presumption of innocence applies,\" he added.Kempten is one of the oldest settlements in Germany. Located in the country's south, it sits under the hills of the Allgäu and has around 70,000 residents.",

    "body": "Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered that right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro begin serving his prison sentence of 27 years and three months for plotting a coup after he lost the last election.Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday ruled that the case had reached its final judgement and that no further appeals were possible. Bolsonaro, 70, was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.He will begin serving his sentence in a federal police jail cell in the capital, Brasilia, where he has been detained since Saturday after being deemed a flight risk and removed from home detention. At a hearing on Sunday, Bolsonaro admitted trying to open his ankle monitor with a soldering iron until he \"came to his senses\", court documents show. He said he had had no intention of fleeing and blamed medicine-induced \"paranoia\" for damage he caused to the monitor. Justice Moraes on Tuesday mandated that full-time medical care be given to Bolsonaro, whose medical team has previously said he is suffering from worsening health.Supreme Court justices said in September, when Bolsonaro was found guilty of plotting a coup, that he had known of plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes, who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro, whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.Bolsonaro was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.The former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.Justice Moraes also ordered on Tuesday that others found guilty of being Bolsonaro's co-conspirators must begin their sentences.They include Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional security, and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, former defence minister.",

    "body": "7 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterForeign tourists visiting popular US national parks like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite will need to pay an extra fee, the Trump administration said on Tuesday.The Department of the Interior, which runs the country's national parks, said each international visitor will need to pay $100 (£76) on top of existing fees to access 11 of the most popular sites.From 2026, non-residents will also need to pay more than $250 for an annual pass to the parks, while US citizens and permanent residents will continue to pay $80.The fee hike aims to \"put American families first\" and reflects President Donald Trump's goal to make the parks more accessible and affordable for US citizens, said the department.\"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.The increase will take effect at the start of 2026, alongside the launch of an upgraded online booking system and better access for motorcyclists across the parks.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, \"patriotic fee-free\" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.The fee hike follows an executive order, signed by Trump in July, to raise entrance fees at national parks for overseas visitors. The extra revenue would raise funds for conservation and maintenance at the sites, the White House said at the time - even as the Trump administration planned deep cuts to the Park Service budget.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before.The country's most visited parks include the Everglades in Florida, Yosemite in California and Colorado's Rocky Mountains.",

    "body": "Australia's landmark social media ban for children is being challenged in the nation's highest court, with two teenagers alleging the law is unconstitutional as it robs them of their right to free communication.From 10 December, social media firms - including Meta, TikTok and YouTube - must ensure that Australians aged under 16 cannot hold accounts on their platforms.The law, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. However, 15-year-olds Noah Jones and Macy Neyland - backed by a rights group - will argue the ban completely disregards the rights of children.\"We shouldn't be silenced. It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Ms Neyland said in a statement.After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.The Digital Freedom Project (DFP) announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.Mr Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.",

    "body": "Israel has confirmed that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) handed over the body of deceased Israeli hostage Dror Or on Tuesday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said his government \"shares in the deep sorrow of the Or family\" following the completion of forensic testing overnight.It stressed that Israeli authorities were working \"tirelessly\" to bring home the last two dead hostages still in Gaza and demanded that Hamas uphold its commitments to hand over their remains under the six-week-old Gaza ceasefire agreement.Or's body was transferred via the Red Cross after PIJ and Hamas announced that it had been recovered in central Gaza on Monday.On Wednesday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its representatives had informed Or's family that his body was returned after experts at the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv confirmed its identity.According to the IDF, the 48-year-old father of three was killed by PIJ at his home in Kibbutz Be'eri during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. His body was then abducted and taken to Gaza as a hostage.Mr Or's wife, Yonat, was also killed during the attack, while two of their children, Noam and Alma, were kidnapped alive. They were held hostage in Gaza until November 2023, when they were released as part of a week-long ceasefire deal.\"The IDF expresses deep condolences to the families, continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages, and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement,\" an IDF statement said.\"Hamas is required to fulfil its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to a dignified burial.\"Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 330 Palestinians killed during the war. It should hand over another 15 bodies in return for Mr Or's remains.One of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli - Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 69,770 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

In Vietnam, the death toll has risen to 98 in a week, while in Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been forced from their homes.More than 2 million people in Thailand have been affected by the floods, but just 13,000 have been moved to shelters. The vast majority are cut off and unable to get help, according to Reuters news agency.The Thai military, which has been put in charge of tackling the crisis, said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies, along with field kitchens that are said to be able to deliver 3,000 meals a day.Medical teams on board the aircraft carrier will convert it into a \"floating hospital\" if required, the navy said.Boats, high-clearance trucks, and jet skis have also been deployed to evacuate residents, said the governor of Songkhla province, where Hat Yai is located.The cabinet on Tuesday declared Songkhla a disaster zone, freeing up funds for relief.However, many people remain stranded amid the rising waters. A volunteer rescue group, the Matchima Rescue Center, told Reuters it had been inundated with thousands of calls in the last three days, with people asking to be evacuated.ReutersA drone view shows dozens of vehicles at least partially submerged in a carpark Hat YaiPeople have also posted urgent calls for help on Matchima's Facebook page. \"Many people are trapped... Please help,\" one user wrote. \"It's very difficult right now. The water has reached the second floor, where there are children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled!!!\" Another wrote that his household had been waiting for help for three days: \"Every second is crucial now... Please help share. My [phone's] battery is at 40%. Thank you everyone.\"Some also wrote about not having had any food and water for days.A clip that has gone viral on social media shows three young boys hanging from power lines, trying to inch their way to safety while brown murky waters continue to rise below them.In Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with 126 evacuation centres set up in the northern border areas.In the states of Kelantan and Perlis, rescue teams waded through knee-deep floodwaters to evacuate residents in areas where rising waters had cut off access to roads.ReutersThe Thai military said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies",

    "body": "1 day agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesMarjorie Taylor Greene's five years in Congress will come to an early end on 5 January after she unexpectedly announced her resignation following a bitter rift with President Donald Trump.The surprise move from the Georgia congresswoman - a rising star in the Republican party - has left many speculating about her next steps.Her decision follows a public fallout with Trump, who branded her \"a traitor\" and said he would endorse her opponent in next year's election. It comes after months of Greene's blistering criticism on the Trump administration's refusal to release files related to the investigation into the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein - as well as several of Trump's policy positions.Rumours have already begun circulating that Greene, 51, might run for president in 2028, which she immediately shot down. So, if not the Oval Office, what is next for Greene? Run for president in 2028Although she claims she has no interest in the presidency now, having a future change of heart is not an unknown feature of US politics.When Greene signed a petition to force a vote requiring the release of the files related to Epstein - over Trump's objections - it went on to a bill authored by her Democratic colleague, Ro Khanna. Khanna told NBC News after Greene's latest announcement that she was \"likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate\", adding that she was \"more in touch\" with Trump's base than his number two, Vice-President JD Vance. Time Magazine also reported that Greene \"privately told allies\" she was considering a presidential bid, but Greene quickly dismissed the assertion as a \"complete lie\".\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene wrote on social media, re-posting Time Magazine's article. Greene has notably distanced herself from her party's positions - and from the president - for whom she once was an ardent supporter. She has spoken out against issues including Epstein files, Trump's global tariffs, support for Israel and healthcare funding. A possible run for governor or Senate Greene has not been quite as explicit about ruling out the possibility of running for Georgia governor or to represent her state in the US Senate.Elections for both take place in 2026.Two-time Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is up against his term limit and unable to run again, widening the field of possible replacements. Greene could also use her clout to pursue the race for the US Senate and attempt to unseat Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year.Both the role of governor and US senator are ones that Greene has expressed interest in, at least according to Trump.In the president's public spat with Greene following her resignation announcement, Trump wrote on social media that the feud began \"when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor\".\"She was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!)\", he said.Kennesaw State University Professor of Political Science Kerwin Swint, who lives in Greene's congressional district, says that Trump is aware of her unpopularity outside of her immediate district, and that she would probably \"get obliterated\" if she ran for statewide office.Without those options, the only other office she may have her sights on is president, despite her protestations.\"I don't see that happening,\" Swint says. \"She would be such an amazing longshot to dark horse. \"But most politicians have a big enough ego that they look in the mirror, they see a future president. So it's not out of the question.\"Entering the conservative media landscape Swint predicts that she'll start a podcast and attempt to remain in the public spotlight by continuing to build her media profile.\"I think she wants to be an influencer basically. And so I think someone who wants to do that is going to reach for these media opportunities,\" he says.If she chooses a life outside of politics, Greene would join a host of former politicians and political operatives who have launched careers in the podcast arena. After Republican Representative Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress to accept his failed nomination to become Trump's US attorney general, he started his own podcast. The trend has even caught hold on the left, with Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom also hosting his own podcast. Meanwhile, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino went on to join the Trump administration after success as a radio host and commentator.Greene could also decide to become a conservative commentator on more left-leaning networks, like CNN, where she has made frequent appearances in recent days. \"I knew she was going to be the next co-host of The View!\", conservative personality Megan McCain wrote on X, referring to Greene's recent appearance on ABC's liberal-leaning daily chat show.Leave politics behind completelyIn the 10-minute video announcing her resignation, Greene also suggested she might leave politics to spend more time with her family who she said she missed \"precious time with\" as she fought for Trump. Throughout her time in politics, Greene said, she faced \"never ending personal attacks\" and \"threats\". \"It has been unfair and wrong, not only to me, but especially to my family,\" she said.  Since her public feud with the president, Greene said the threats against her have only increased.In addition to being a member of Congress, Greene is also the owner of a commercial construction and renovation company called Taylor Commercial. The company has managed roughly $250m in construction projects, since Greene acquired it in 2002, according to her website. With reporting by Max Matza",

    "body": "2 hours agoJon DonnisonCorrespondent, JerusalemZaher IbrahimMohammed Ibrahim was 15 when he was arrested at his family's holiday home in the occupied West BankA Palestinian-American teenager is expected to appear in court in Israel later this week after nine months in detention without being charged.Mohammed Ibrahim, who is 16 and lives in Florida, was arrested in February while on holiday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank for allegedly throwing stones at Jewish settlers, something he denies.Last month, 27 Democratic US Senators and House members sent a letter to the US State Department, urging the Trump administration to do more to pressure Israel to release him.In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Mohammed had committed a \"a serious potentially deadly crime\" and that the court was proceeding under due process.The teenager's family disagrees.\"You can ask anybody you know, he's a real sweet boy, into his sports and his PlayStation and school,\" his father, Zahar Ibrahim, tells me before wiping a tear from his eye.Mohammed was arrested in a raid on his family's holiday home in the Palestinian village of al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya in the middle of the night by Israeli soldiers. He was 15 years old at the time.Mr Ibrahim has not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February.\"He's just a regular fun kid that loves and respects anybody,\" Mr Ibrahim tells me from the holiday home.Unable to speak to his son for nine months, Mr Ibrahim has only heard accounts of his detention through court documents and says his son was forced to confess.According to the court documents, he says, Mohammed woke up surrounded by Israeli soldiers. \"They tied him up and blindfolded him, and they threw him on the floor of the jeep and took him to wherever they took him.\"Mr Ibrahim, a father of four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, says his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.The Israeli prime minister's office has not responded to a request for comment on whether Mohammed is being held without charge or the allegation that he was beaten while in detention.The US embassy assigned a case worker who has visited Mohammed in prison. Mr Ibrahim says they told him he had lost a lot of weight and was not doing well.He has a message for President Donald Trump, another Florida resident.\"Do what you said from day one. You know America first. He's American, and he's a citizen and he's a child. So, you know, as a president, his [Trump's] duty is to protect Americans, and we're not seeing that for Mohammed.\"\"What's lucky about an American passport?\" Mr Ibrahim says. \"It's not helping. That's one thing that usually a foreign passport makes a difference, but the US state department is not really doing anything.\"A state department spokesperson told the BBC that it was \"tracking Mr Ibrahim's case closely and working with the government of Israel on this case\".US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and embassy staff in Jerusalem were also \"deeply involved\", they said, before adding that they could not comment further \"due to privacy and other considerations\".Zaher IbrahimMohammed is accused of throwing stones at Israeli settlers - something he deniesBecause Mohammed is an American citizen who was only on holiday in the West Bank when he was arrested, his case has attracted the attention of US lawmakers.\"This is a case where the US does have influence. It's just failing to exercise its influence, and that's a great dereliction of duty,\" says Democratic US Senator, Chris van Hollen, from his office in Washington DC.Along with 26 other US lawmakers he has written a letter to the state department and President Trump demanding more to be done to release Mohammed.\"If this were any other country, you would be seeing a much bigger effort. But for whatever reason, the Trump administration does not want to push the Netanyahu government to do what it needs to do,\" Van Hollen tells us.\"You have an American citizen who is being terribly mistreated, who has been beaten up, who has been deprived of adequate food and nutrition, and I haven't heard much from the US government. I haven't heard anything from the secretary of state. I mean, Donald Trump himself. I mean, who says that he is the 'America First' president?\"Mohammed is being held without charge at Ofer prison in the West Bank. It also houses adult detainees, including some who have been convicted of the most serious terrorist offences including murder.Mohammed's case has become relatively high profile because he is an American citizen.But there are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.\"We should be demanding justice,\" says Van Hollen.As I leave Zahar Ibrahim's holiday home in al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya, he looks drained and alone. The house is sparse. Just a set of weights to fill his time.All he can do is wait.",

    "body": "2 days agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent , Geneva Donald Trump wants a peace deal in Ukraine very badly.Kyiv wants peace even more, just not at any cost.That's why when the US began pushing it to agree to a deal by Thanksgiving on what looked close to surrender terms, Ukraine pushed back.It scrambled senior officials to talks in Geneva and all of Sunday we saw delegates from the US and Ukraine shuttling back and forth between the two main venues in black limousines with darkened windows.They were joined by national security advisers from Germany, France and the UK.The only time I glimpsed Andriy Yermak, heading the negotiating team from Kyiv, he looked stony-faced.No wonder: the starting proposal on the table was so skewed towards Russia's demands, the talks began with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny it had been written by the Kremlin.But Donald Trump had been clear that Ukraine needed to sign up fast or face unspecified consequences. So Kyiv had to engage.On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though - Ukraine's deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.Several officials, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.But it's hard to escape the sense that these days of frantic diplomacy have only brought us back to where we started\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"",

    "body": "2 days agoJane ChambersBusiness reporter, Aguas Calientes, PeruAFP via Getty ImagesMachu Picchu attracts more than 1.6 million tourists per year, but getting there is not easyMachu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.Wilson ChiloA fleet of buses ferry tourists to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas CalientesBack in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,\" he says. \"This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners.\"These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.AFP via Getty ImagesUnless you fancy a long hike, the only way to get to the town of Aguas Calientes is by trainAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train.\"Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site \"was a nightmare for us\". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.Wilson ChiloCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón says Consettur would welcome the competitionOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that \"more needs to be done for the local communities\".She adds: \"We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition.\"Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru.\"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,\" he says. \"If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term.\"He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,\" says Mr Gonzalez. \"And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion.\"But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years.\"I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to.\"Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Toronto run buses to and from Machu Picchu.\"If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them.\"Read more global business and tech stories",

    "body": "2 days agoJonathan Beale, Anastasiia Levchenko and Volodymyr Lozhko in KyivReutersSome troops are resigned to the proposals but many remain defiant, and angryUkraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation.The BBC spoke to half a dozen who sent us their views via social media and email in response to the original US plan – details of which were leaked last week.Since then, American and Ukrainian negotiators have been working on changes to the proposals – and are set to continue talks about the \"peace framework\". Of the original US plan, Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it \"sucks… no one will support it\" while an army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an \"absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention\".But one soldier with the call sign Snake told us \"it's time to agree at least on something\".This is what the soldiers who spoke to the BBC had to say about some of the key points in the original US draft peace plan.Giving up territoryThe US put forward a draft peace proposal at a time when Russia is making significant advances on the battlefield. Over the past month alone Ukraine has lost a further 450 sq km to Russia. Kyiv still controls around 15% of the Donbas region, the eastern part of Ukraine encompassing the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts which is a key war goal for Russia. But the original US plan proposes that Ukraine give up the entire region - even parts it has successfully defended for nearly four years of full-scale war.\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, says that what is being proposed for Luhansk and Donetsk is \"painful and difficult\" but he suggests the country may have no other choice.Ukraine has been defending the region since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces seized parts of the Donbas. \"We may not want to give it up, but we won't be able to hold it by military force and resources,\" Andrii says.Eastern Ukraine has been the scene of the heaviest fighting in this war, and Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of troops defending it. Matros, who has been fighting since 2018, told us giving up the Donbas would \"nullify everything - all the efforts of the armed forces\". \"It will disregard the lives of fallen soldiers and civilians,\" he said.Cutting the size of Ukraine's armed forcesThe US draft peace plan envisages limiting the size of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000. That is still significantly more than before the full-scale invasion when its full-time strength was around 250,000, but smaller than its current size. The most recent estimates suggest Ukraine's military strength is more than 800,000.Snake believes the country will need many of those currently in uniform to help rebuild Ukraine when the war ends. \"What's the point of having so many people in the army if there will be security guarantees?\" he asks.Andrii the staff officer agrees. \"If there are security guarantees, then of course there's no point in keeping such a large army,\" he says. \"People are tired and want to return to their families. There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.Getty ImagesIt is thought more than 800,000 Ukrainians are currently in uniformArmy medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".Security guaranteesUkraine's willingness to agree to the proposals will depend on its future security guarantees.The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union. There is a promise of US security guarantees if Russia were to attack again, though no further detail on the measure of that support. The draft also rules out the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine, if there is a deal.But Yevhen, a drone operator in eastern Ukraine, thinks the presence of foreign troops in the country is an important security guarantee. The UK and France have been leading efforts to provide a \"reassurance force\" in the event of a ceasefire, through a \"Coalition of the Willing\". \"I like the UK's plan to put troops into Ukraine [through this coalition],\" he says. \"This is the only plan that will help us win, to introduce allied troops.\"Getty ImagesThe UK is one of the countries which is planning to send forces to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefireBut staff officer Andrii does not believe Europe can provide much in the way of security guarantees. \"Europe has turned out to be completely spineless and divided,\" he says. \"It seems all hope rests only on the United States.\"However, other soldiers suggest there is no great faith in the US either. \"US security guarantees under its current government are not guarantees at all,\" says Schtutser.Fresh electionsThe US draft plan sets out a proposal for Ukraine to hold fresh elections within 100 days of the end of the war. Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"",

    "body": "Music eases surgery and speeds recovery, Indian study finds1 day agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentBBCA patient with headphones playing music during surgery in a hospital in DelhiUnder the harsh lights of an operating theatre in the Indian capital, Delhi, a woman lies motionless as surgeons prepare to remove her gallbladder.She is under general anaesthesia: unconscious, insensate and rendered completely still by a blend of drugs that induce deep sleep, block memory, blunt pain and temporarily paralyse her muscles.Yet, amid the hum of monitors and the steady rhythm of the surgical team, a gentle stream of flute music plays through the headphones placed over her ears.Even as the drugs silence much of her brain, its auditory pathway remains partly active. When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.That, at least, is what a new peer-reviewed study from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\" Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.Getty ImagesPatients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgeryIn procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. \"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by Michael Jackson's death but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups The results were striking.Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.",

During the televised pardon, Waddle, apparently, was nowhere to be found.\"Waddle, by the way, is missing in action, but that's okay,\" the president said.The annual event is a White House tradition going back years when the US president pardons turkeys in the days before Thanksgiving, when roast turkey is typically served at dinner.Waddle and Gobble spent the night before their big day in the presidential suite at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington DC, where they generated a lot of interest from the DC press. Trump last pardoned turkeys for Thanksgiving in 2020, when he saved Corn and Cob from the dinner table. ",

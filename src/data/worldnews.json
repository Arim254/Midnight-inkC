    "body": "5 hours agoStuart Lau andDanny AeberhardBBC World ServiceBloomberg via Getty ImagesA Danish warship off Nuuk, Greenland (April 2025)Denmark has announced $4.2bn (£3.2bn) of extra defence spending to boost security in the Arctic and North Atlantic regions, including Greenland.It will also spend $4.5bn buying 16 more F-35 fighter jets from the US, bringing its total fleet of such advanced planes to 43.\"With this... agreement we significantly strengthen the capabilities of the Danish Armed Forces in the region,\" Denmark's Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said in a statement on Friday.The Arctic is at a critical crossroads between North America, Russia and the rest of Europe. The statement by the Danish defence ministry says the purpose of its military is security, and if necessary, defence in the Nato security alliance.\"The task of the Armed Forces is to ensure security throughout the Kingdom - and, if necessary, to defend Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark within the framework of Nato in all domains,\" the Chief of Defence, Michael Hyldgaard, told Danish public broadcaster DR, without saying who the potential adversaries were.Denmark worked on the new defence package with the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.It will buy two new Arctic ships, maritime patrol planes, drones and early warning radar.Crucially, a new Arctic command headquarters will be set up in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, alongside a new military unit under Joint Arctic Command in Greenland.In addition, an undersea cable connecting Greenland and Denmark will be funded. The struggle for control of the Arctic is accelerating - and riskier than everGreenland in particular is strategically located between North America and Russia. Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of Denmark.In recent years, there has been increased interest in the vast island's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron.Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. The island has been home to a US radar base since the Cold War and also hosts a large American space facility.US President Donald Trump has suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are \"all over the place\".Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to acquire Greenland, saying the island was \"critical\" for national and economic security.Greenland's prime minister has said the territory is not for sale, adding that \"Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland\"."

    "body": "10 hours agoHarry Sekulich andJaroslav LukivOvernight Russian missile and drone strikes have caused power cuts in large parts of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and eight other regions.Kyiv's authorities said power was later restored to more than 540,000 consumers in the city - but many households are still without electricity.Twelve people were injured in the city, said Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko. In the southern Zaporizhzhia region, a seven-year-old boy was killed and seven others injured. Ten people were also injured in the central Cherkasy region.Russia's defence ministry said its \"massive\" strike with high-precision weapons - including hypersonic missiles - targeted energy facilities used by Ukraine's \"military-industrial complex\".Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - has escalated attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities as well as transport infrastructure as winter approaches.Reacting to the latest Russian strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated calls for allies to act decisively to \"defend people from this terror\".\"What's needed is not empty words but decisive action - from the United States, Europe and the G7 - in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions,\" he wrote.Zelensky said that more than 450 drones and over 30 missiles targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, describing such attacks as \"cynical and calculated\" and against \"everything that sustains normal life\" as temperatures become colder.More than 5,800 residential buildings in Kyiv were without electricity on Friday morning, local officials said. The city's eastern districts were the worst hit.Images of firefighters putting out blazes at a 10-storey building have been released by Ukraine's state emergency services.Residents in more than 7,000 buildings were left for hours without water - but the supplies were restored in the evening, the authorities said.Public transport - including the capital's widely used underground system - was also badly affected, with some stations forced to close after the Russian strikes.So-called \"invincibility\" tents - where people can get hot water and charge their gadgets - have been set up on the streets of Kyiv and other cities. Ukraine's Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said Russia was \"inflicting a massive strike\" and repair crews were working to restore power.\"Exactly three years ago - to the day - on 10 October, our power system experienced one of the first massive attacks. Today, Russia continues to use cold and darkness as a tool of terror,\" she said.Ukrainian officials said they were forced to roll out emergency power outages in Kyiv and the capital region, as well as in the Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kirovohrad and Zaporizhzhia regions.On Thursday, Zelensky told reporters that Russia was intentionally trying to demolish the country's energy grid, with attacks already disrupting gas facilities.He said energy workers and authorities were bracing for further attacks.Also on Friday, Zelensky told the BBC he would urge UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to join the PURL programme, under which Nato countries buy weapons from the US to give to Ukraine.While praising the UK's strong support for Kyiv - one of the largest in Europe - he said it should send a clear signal it will take part in the system, as well as imposing more sanctions on Russia.Downing Street later said Sir Keir and Zelensky had spoken, and agreed more sanctions on Russia \"in the coming days and weeks\" would put further \"pressure\" on Moscow."

    "body": "7 hours agoAnahita SachdevBBC News, DelhiSaffronartVS Gaitonde's Untitled fetched $40.2m at a recent record-breaking auction in DelhiA radiant golden canvas layered with subtle textures and faint shapes, exuding both energy and tranquillity.This untitled 1971 painting by Vasudeo Santu Gaitonde headlined a record-breaking recent Saffronart auction in Delhi, which fetched $40.2m (£29.9m) - the highest-ever total for South Asian art. Gaitonde's work alone sold for $7.57m, nearly three times its estimate, making it India's second most expensive painting.The bidding added momentum to an already strong auction season for Indian art. Just days later, Sotheby's sold artist Francis Newton Souza's landscape, Houses in Hampstead, at a price marginally lower than Gaitonde's piece, making it India's third highest grossing painting. Earlier this year, the record for India's most expensive painting was reset when MF Husain's Untitled (Gram Yatra) fetched a staggering $13.8m.Auctioneers and curators say India's art market is witnessing an unprecedented boom, driven by a surge of art fairs, galleries, and exhibition spaces across cities and towns.Industry insiders estimate that the market is worth $338m, up exponentially from $2m at the turn of the century, and will expand to $1.1bn by 2030.Sotheby'sFrancis Newton Souza's Houses in Hampstead has become India's third most expensive paintingDinesh Vazirani, a founder of Saffronart, believes this is a \"point of massive inflection\".Marking its 25th anniversary, Saffronart's recent auction saw a packed room, spirited bidding, and a rare \"white glove\" result - every lot sold, with some attendees even \"squabbling\" over artworks, according to an attendee.\"When we started in 2000, people said we were crazy. Who's going to buy art online?\" Mr Vazirani said.\"Seeing the art market with so much strength almost validated that what we started as maybe foolish young people has become a very mature industry.\"The boom in Indian art - which dominates South Asia's market - comes even as global art sales slump. The 2024 Art Basel and UBS report shows a 12% drop worldwide, the second yearly decline.Mr Vazirani predicts the auction market could double last year's earnings, driven by rising wealth in India and among the diaspora. Millionaire households have nearly doubled in four years. As the rich pour money into their luxurious lifestyle, art has become both a status symbol and an investment. For these groups, art is a generational asset that can also be enjoyed, Mr Vazirani argues.\"They understand that you can't buy it and trade in it. But if you hold it for long periods of time, the appreciation is quite dramatic.\"Recent tax cuts slashing goods and services tax (GST) on art from 12% to 5% have also helped boost the market.While global buyers dominate, much of the demand abroad comes from diaspora collectors seeking \"a slice of their heritage\", said Manjari Sihare-Sutin, co-head of Sotheby's Indian and South Asian Art department. Its recent auction, which sold the Souza painting, was another \"white glove\" sale, earning $25.5m - the department's highest total in 30 years.\"I think art has become an important conduit for both local collectors and Indian diaspora outside of India to reconnect with their roots,\" Ms Sihare-Sutin said.GettyThe Kochi-Muziris Biennale in the southern state of Kerala is popular for its exhibits These trends have attracted new buyers: a third of Sotheby's last-month bidders were first-timers with them, while Saffronart reports 25–30% of its buyers are recent entrants.While top sales often feature established modernists like Husain, Souza, Gaitonde, and Raza, auctioneers say rising top prices lift demand and values for previously overlooked artists as well.Unlike the brief speculative boom of the early 2000s, which collapsed in 2008, insiders say the current surge in the Indian art market feels more sustainable, going beyond galleries and auctions.Curator Ina Puri notes a resurgence in India's art scene, driven by growing recognition of Indian artists and increased investment in spaces for public engagement.\"I feel that Indian art has made a comeback,\" Ms Puri said.\"Across the country, there are new institutions, museums and spaces coming up to showcase art.\" Government funding for the arts has long lagged behind other priorities, leaving the private sector to lead. A notable example is Kiran Nadar Museum of Art's new Delhi building, set to open in 2026, spanning 100,000 sq m and showcasing both visual and performance art.Other examples: Hampi Art Labs in Karnataka offers exhibitions and artist residencies; Art Mumbai fair's third edition in November expects 40,000 visitors; and Renault's planned Chennai design centre will merge technology with artistic collaboration.These join established events like the India Art Fair in Delhi and Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Kerala, which draw record crowds annually.Galleries are increasingly showcasing indigenous and marginalised art, Ms Puri said, though more support is needed for students and emerging artists. AFP via Getty ImagesThe India Art Fair in Delhi is a popular event that receives thousands of visitors annuallyDelhi-based non-profit Khoj, founded in 1997, tries to fill this gap by supporting emerging artists through programs and residencies. Director Pooja Sood notes growing participation from smaller towns often overlooked by the art world.\"They're trying to build their own thing,\" she said. \"It's fantastic\".Rising interest in South Asian art boosts the ecosystem, but record-breaking sales of established artists don't directly aid newcomers - ground-up support remains essential.Ms Sood stresses that Khoj operates outside the commercial art world, offering young and mid-career artists a space to explore, experiment, and \"even fail if they have to\".\"I feel the more mad, crazy, experimental art happens in very small pockets, and that's what we're always trying to build.\""

    "body": "14 hours agoSammy AwamiBBC Africa, AntananarivoSammy Awami / BBCRazanasoa Edmondine looking at the photos on her phone of her new grandsonRazanasoa Edmondine still looks shell-shocked as she recalls the death of her one-month-old grandson, killed by police tear gas in protests that have rocked Madagascar over the last two weeks.\"It was just a normal Friday. My daughter-in-law was going to the market with the baby when they encountered demonstrators on the road,\" she tells the BBC at the family's home on the northern outskirts of the capital, Antananarivo.\"Not long after, police showed up and started dispersing the protest with tear gas.\"It was the second day of youth-led protests, triggered by anger over persistent power and water shortages, and Ms Edmondine's daughter-in-law ran into a nearby building with other protesters to take cover.Police then fired more tear gas canisters into the building, quickly filling it with choking smoke.With the streets in chaos, they could not get to a hospital until the following day. By then, the damage had been done.\"The baby was trying to cry but no sound came out,\" says Ms Edmondine softly.\"It was like something was blocking his chest. The doctor told us he had inhaled too much smoke. A couple of days later, he passed away.\"Protest organiser tells the BBC the country needs \"radical change\"Her grandchild is one of at least 22 people the UN says were killed during clashes between police and demonstrators in the early days of the protests, which have since escalated into broader dissatisfaction over corruption, high unemployment and the cost-of-living crisis in one of the world's poorest nations.The government of President Andry Rajoelina has dismissed this figure as misinformation but has not provided its own numbers.However, it has emphasised that the value of property damage exceeds $47m (£35m). The first days of the protests were marked by widespread violence, with cars set on fire, shop windows smashed and a two-month-old, multi-million-dollar cable car station vandalised.Rabe, who only gave the BBC his first name, has accused the police of firing live bullets at peaceful protesters - a few blocks away from where Ms Edmondine's daughter-in-law was hiding.As police launched tear gas, panic spread fast and people fled in every direction, seeking shelter inside any open building, but he says his 20-year-old autistic son did not understand what was happening.\"He must have slipped outside to see what was going on. That's when the police shot him and continued chasing other protesters.\"He believes his son was shot from the front, as the bullet left a large open wound in his back - the likely exit wound.\"I don't know much, but as far as I know, when someone raises their hands, it means they haven't stolen anything, they haven't vandalised anything,\" says Rabe. \"He was just there to see what was happening.\"Responding to accusations of police brutality, earlier this week President Rajoelina said: \"There have been deaths, we completely agree. And I truly sympathise with the suffering and pain of the families who have lost loved ones.\"But I want to tell you that these deaths are not protesters, they are not students. They are rioters. They are the ones who looted.\"AFP/Getty ImagesThe protests were triggered by anger over a lack of access to water and electricitySome business owners say the prolonged protests have disrupted commercial activity and cut into their income, especially for those in city centre neighbourhoods around the University of Antananarivo, from where the protests have been organised.\"I fully support Gen Z, but I don't think protests are the right way to address their grievances. When people demonstrate, I can't do business,\" says Laza Brenda, who runs a roadside mobile phone repair kiosk.For entrepreneur Ulrichia Rabefitiavana, the uncertainty has spooked several of her international clients, who have cancelled contracts for training and seminar events.\"We've had to postpone a major event involving more than 2,000 people that we've been preparing for over six months. It was supposed to take place this week. It's been very challenging for us to postpone everything and lose that money,\" says Ms Rabefitiavana.The tourism sector on the Indian Ocean island, which is famous for its unique wildlife, is among the hardest hit with the situation catching most people by surprise.\"We have received nothing but cancellations. Normally, the period of mid-September and October is the busiest period for us,\" says François van Rens from the Radisson Hotel Group.\"We normally operate around 60, 70% occupancy but we have now dropped down to 10%. So it's like in full throttle and all of the sudden the handbrake.\"Sammy Awami / BBCThis woman earns $2.30 a week selling doughnuts - with which she must support her young sonThe anger of the youth movement behind the demonstrations, known as Gen Z Mada, has grown with the protesters now calling for the president to step down.The evidence of young people's frustrations, whether it is unemployment, water scarcity or struggling businesses, is not hard to find across Antananarivo.At the airport, for example, visitors with just a few bags are quickly surrounded by two or three young people eager to help in exchange for a small tip.Anyone leaving their car parked outside a cafe or restaurant will almost certainly be approached by a couple of young men asking for a fee after claiming they have \"guarded\" the vehicle.On the roadside, a young woman selling sweet doughnuts tells the BBC she earns $2.30 a week, money she relies on to feed her four-year-old child.\"I'm only allowed to do business at this spot on weekends because during the week someone else uses it for their own business,\" she says while turning the dough in boiling oil.Driving through the outskirts of Antananarivo, it is common to see families washing clothes in paddy fields, a visible reminder of the severe water shortages in people's homes.ReutersWater is hard to come by for most in the city and people have to buy it from water sellersOne of the main protest organisers, who requested anonymity for safety reasons and organised to meet us near the rice fields, told the BBC he had to walk a mile each day to get water from a well – and he considers himself middle-class.\"To be a young person in Madagascar, you have to be tough,\" he adds, explaining that insecurity is rife.\"You live in constant fear of when your house will be broken into, when you will be shot by people, when you'll be stabbed on the streets. It's like your humanity has been stolen from you and taken away.\"He demands \"radical change\" to deal with the island's chronic socio-economic challenges.According to Hery Ramiarison, professor of economics at the University of Antananarivo, these are the result of decades of poor economic planning and the government's failure to create inclusive wealth.\"There is a huge employment problem among young people,\" he explains.\"It stems from very low levels of education in the labour force, serious deficiencies in the education system both in quantity and quality, widespread school dropouts, and a near-total absence of training opportunities adapted for them.\"The academic finds it striking that after 64 years of independence, three-quarters of the population have an education level below primary school, while only 3% have attained higher education.Sammy Awami / BBCLaza Brenda says he supports the Gen Z demands but says protests are bad for businessPresident Rajoelina has asked the Malagasy people to give him one year to fix the problems driving the protests, saying he will resign if fails to meet the deadline.But Prof Ramiarison feels the president does not understand the complexities of how Madagascar has become trapped in two vicious circles of poverty that feed into each other.One is driven by weak economic growth, the other stems from political instability, which discourages investment and growth and pushes people deeper into poverty, fuelling social unrest.\"To break free from the poverty trap, it is essential to first break the primary vicious circle by addressing its root causes - namely the key determinants of economic growth,\" he says.Madagascar has experienced repeated political turmoil since gaining independence from France, including the mass protests in 2009 that toppled then-President Marc Ravalomanana - the once popular dairy tycoon.That saw the rise of Rajoelina, a former DJ and then the mayor of Antananarivo, who seized power in the aftermath.From his roadside phone shop, Mr Brenda says: \"Once they're in power, they forget us. It's always the same.\"More on Madagascar's Gen Z crisis:Behind the Gen Z protesters who want to force Madagascar's president from powerPolice fire rubber bullets as Madagascar protesters reject president's promisesArmy general named as Madagascar PM to quell Gen Z protestsGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts"

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAFPSébastien Lecornu spent just 26 days as prime minister before his dramatic resignation last MondayPresident Emmanuel Macron has asked Sébastien Lecornu to return as French prime minister only four days after he stood down from the post, sparking a week of high drama and political turmoil.Macron made the announcement late on Friday, hours after meeting all the main parties together at the Élysée Palace, except the leaders of the far right and far left. Lecornu's return came as a surprise, as he said on national TV only two days ago he was not \"chasing the job\" and his \"mission is over\". It is not even certain he will be able to form a government, but he will have to hit the ground running. The new prime minister faces a deadline on Monday to put next year's budget before parliament.  The Élysée said the president had \"tasked [Lecornu] with forming a government\" and Macron's entourage indicated he had been given \"carte blanche\" to act.Lecornu, who is 39 and one of Macron's most loyal allies, then released a long statement on X in which he accepted \"out of duty the mission entrusted to me by the president, to do everything to provide France with a budget by the end of the year and respond to the everyday problems of our compatriots\".When he appeared on French TV this week, Lecornu described himself as a \"soldier-monk\", and as he prepared to get to grips with forming a government he said on Friday \"I will do everything to succeed in this mission\".AFP via Getty ImagesNational Rally leader Marine Le Pen (L) was not invited to Macron's talks and went to talk to voters at a livestock show insteadPolitical divisions over how to bring down France's national debt and cut the budget deficit have led to the fall of two of the past three prime ministers in the last year, so his challenge is immense. France's public debt earlier this year was almost 114% of economic output (GDP) - the third highest in the eurozone - and this year's budget deficit is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.Among the conditions Lecornu listed for taking on the job, one was that \"no-one will be able to shirk\" the necessity of restoring France's public finances. With only 18 months before the end of Macron's presidency, he also warned that anyone joining his government would have to put on hold their presidential ambitions. What makes it even harder for Lecornu is that he will face a vote of confidence in a National Assembly where Macron has no majority to support him. The president's popularity hit a record low this week, according to an Elabe poll that put his approval rating on 14%.Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally, which was not invited to Macron's talks with party leaders on Friday, said that Lecornu's reappointment was a \"bad joke\", from a president \"more than ever isolated and disconnected at the Élysée\".Bardella said his party would immediately bring a vote of no confidence against a doomed coalition, whose only reason for being was fear of an election. National Rally is currently leading in the polls.Lecornu at least knows the pitfalls ahead as he tries to form a government, because he has already spent two days this week talking to parties that might take part.He was first appointed prime minister on 9 September and took the next three weeks to put together a government, only for it to fall apart overnight when the the leader of the conservative Republicans, Bruno Retailleau, criticised one of the ministerial appointments.By themselves the centrist parties cannot form a government, and there are splits within the conservative Republicans who have helped prop up Macron's governments since he lost his majority in elections last year. Retailleau, who is known to have presidential ambitions, has made clear he will not be part of Lecornu II, and has declared the socle commun (common platform) of centrists and conservatives as dead. Not all his party colleagues agree.But it means the centrist prime minister is also looking to left-wing parties for potential support.In an attempt to court the left, Macron's team indicated the president was considering a delay to part of his highly contentious pension reforms passed in 2023 which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.AFP via Getty ImagesMarine Tondelier (L) of the Greens said she saw no reason not to bring a vote of no confidence in a Lecornu government That risks angering key centrist allies, who fought hard to get pension reforms through. It also falls short of the demands of left-wing leaders as they were hoping Macron would choose a prime minister from their side. Olivier Faure of the Socialists said \"since we've not been given any guarantees, we won't give any guarantee [to back the prime minister] in a vote of confidence\".Fabien Roussel from the Communists said after meeting the president that the left wanted real change, and a prime minister from the president's centrist camp would not be accepted by the French people.Greens leader Marine Tondelier said she was \"stunned\" Macron had offered the left almost nothing, adding that \"all of this is going to turn out very badly\". While Macron and his reappointed prime minister look to slash the government's budget deficit by tens of billions of euros, the head of France's central bank has warned that the political turmoil will set the economy back even further.The bank is forecasting growth this year of 0.7%, but its chief François Villeroy de Galhau says it could have been higher and the uncertainty surrounding the crisis has cost France an estimated 0.2% of extra growth.\"Like many in France I've had enough of this [political] mess,\" he told RTL radio. \"It's time for compromises - that's not a dirty word - even forming coalitions.\"If Lecornu fails to form a government, there could be even more instability, and that will cost the French economy even more."

    "body": "'It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley7 hours agoLily JamaliTechnology correspondent, San FranciscoGetty ImagesSilicon Valley is home to many major tech firms, including Apple's circular headquartersAt OpenAI's DevDay this week, OpenAI boss Sam Altman did what American tech bosses rarely do these days: he actually answered questions from reporters.\"I know it's tempting to write the bubble story,\" Mr Altman told me as he sat flanked by his top lieutenants. \"In fact, there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.\"In Silicon Valley, the debate over whether AI companies are overvalued has taken on a new urgency. Sceptics are privately - and some now publicly - asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call \"financial engineering\".In other words - there are fears these companies are overvalued.Mr Altman said he expected investors would make some bad calls and silly start-ups would walk away with crazy money.But with OpenAI, he told me, \"there's something real happening here\".Not everyone is convinced.In recent days, warnings of an AI bubble have come from the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund, as well as JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon who told the BBC \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".And here, in what is often considered the tech capital of the world, concerns are growing.At a panel discussion at Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum this week, early AI entrepreneur Jerry Kaplan told a packed audience he has lived through four bubbles.Getty ImagesJerry Kaplan founded Go Corporation, which developed early tablet computersHe's especially concerned now given the magnitude of money on the table as compared to the dot-com boom. There's so much more to lose.\"When [the bubble] breaks, it's going to be really bad, and not just for people in AI,\" he said. \"It's going to drag down the rest of the economy.\"However, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which has minted its fair share of tech entrepreneurs, Prof Anat Admati says while there have been many attempts to model when we're in the bubble, it can be a futile exercise.\"It is very hard to time a bubble,\" Prof Admati told me. \"And you can't say with certainty you were in one until after the bubble has burst.\"But the data is concerning to many.AI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year - and Gartner estimates global spending on AI will likely reach a whopping $1.5tn (£1.1tn) before 2025 is out.OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, is at the centre of the tangled web of deals drawing scrutiny.For example - last month, it entered into a $100bn deal with chipmaker Nvidia, which is itself the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.It expands an existing investment Nvidia already had in Mr Altman's company - with  expectations that OpenAI will build data centres powered with Nvidia's advanced chips.Then on Monday, OpenAI announced plans to purchase billions of dollars worth of equipment for developing AI from Nvidia rival AMD, in a deal that could make it one of AMD's largest shareholders.Remember this is a private company, albeit one recently valued at a half-trillion dollars.Then there's tech giant Microsoft, which is heavily invested, and cloud computing behemoth Oracle has a $300bn deal with OpenAI, too.OpenAI's Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, funded with the help of Oracle and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and announced at the White House during President Donald Trump's first week in office, grows ever larger every few months. And as for Nvidia, it has a stake in AI startup CoreWeave - which supplies OpenAI with some of its massive infrastructure needs.Getty ImagesOpenAI boss Sam Altman And as these increasingly complex financing arrangements get more and more common, the experts here in Silicon Valley say they may be clouding perceptions on AI demand.Some people aren't mincing their words about it either, calling the deals \"circular financing\" or even \"vendor financing\" - where a company invests in or lends to its own customers so they can continue making purchases.\"Yes, the investment loans are unprecedented,\" Mr Altman told me on Monday. But, he added, \"it's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast.\"OpenAI's revenue is growing quickly, but it has never turned a profit.And it is hardly a good sign that the people I've spoken to keep bringing up Nortel - the Canadian telecom equipment-maker that borrowed prolifically to help finance deals for their customers (and thereby artificially boost demand for their wares). For his part, Nvidia's Jensen Huang defended his deal with OpenAI on CNBC Monday, saying the firm isn't required to buy his company's tech with the money he invests.\"They can use it to do anything they like,\" Huang said. \"There's no exclusivities. Our primary goal is just really to support them and help them grow – and grow the ecosystem.\"Telltale signsMr Kaplan says he sees a couple of telltale signs the AI sector - and therefore the wider economy - could be in trouble.In frothy times, he says, companies announce major initiatives and product plans that they don't yet have the capital for.Meanwhile, retail investors clamour to get in on the start-up action.The surge in AMD stock this week could indicate investors are trying to get a piece of the ChatGPT wealth machine - and while all this is playing out, real physical infrastructure aimed at satisfying the seemingly insatiable hunger for more AI development is being built.\"We're creating a new man-made ecological disaster: enormous data centres in remote places like deserts, that will be rusting away and leaching bad things into the environment, with no one left to hold accountable because the builders and investors will be long gone,\" Mr Kaplan said.Getty ImagesOpenAI wants to secure $500bn to build a 10-gigawatt complex, under construction in Texas, by the end of this year.But even if we are in a bubble, the hope from Silicon Valley is investments being made now won't necessary go to waste.\"The thing that comforts me is that the internet was built on the ashes of the over-investment into the telecom infrastructure of yesterday,\" said Jeff Boudier, who builds products at the AI community hub Hugging Face.\"If there is overinvestment into infrastructure for AI workloads, there may be financial risks tied to it,\" he said. \"But it's going to enable lots of great new products and experiences including ones we're not thinking about today.\"There are plenty of believers in AI's potential to transform society.The question is whether the money to fund the ambitions of the foremost companies in the sector may be drying up.\"Nvidia looks like the last lender or investor,\" said Rihard Jarc, who founded the UncoverAlpha newsletter. \"Who else has the capacity right now to invest $100 billion in another company?\""

But the usually barren landscape has been transformed by a carpet of colourful wildflowers, which have been brought to life by significant rainfall during the southern hemisphere's winter months.This is thought to be an event that only occurs every few years, when above average rainfall soaks the desert floor, causing dormant seeds to spring to life.AFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresAFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThe Atacama desert typically receives less than 15mm of rain every year.But the area had more than 12mm of rain during August alone - most of which fell on just one day.The desert even saw a rare blanket of snow back in June.AFP via Getty Images/Jose TorresThis magnificent bloom is made up of more than 200 different species of wildflowers, some of which do not grow anywhere else in the world. It typically occurs between the end of August and November.Although thought of as rare, this phenomenon also occurred in 2024, following heavy rainfall in the area.This year's display will be at its peak for another few weeks, according to CONAF, Chile's National Forest Corporation.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'"

    "body": "15 hours agoBrandon DrenonWashington DC First Lady Melania Trump says Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to her letter of concern about the child victims of the Russia-Ukraine war.She made the announcement on Friday, saying that after an \"open channel of communication\" with Putin, Ukranian children displaced in the war had been reunited with families.The First Lady's \"peace letter\" was hand delivered to Putin during his Alaska visit in August.President Donald Trump shared parts of the letter on social media. In it, the first lady pleads with Putin to protect children, writing that doing so \"will do more than serve Russia alone\" and \"will serve humanity itself\".\"Eight children have been rejoined with their families during the past 24 hours,\" Mrs Trump said, flanked by American flags behind a podium in the White House.\"Each child has lived in turmoil because of the war in Ukraine.\"Of the eight children, the First Lady said three separated from their families were displaced to Russia because of front-line fighting.Another young girl displaced by the conflict has now been returned from Ukraine to Russia, Mrs Trump says.The children's reunification with their families was facilitated by both Ukraine and Russia, the First Lady said, adding that she was given a detailed report with photographs and the \"identities and circumstances\" of each child.The US government \"confirmed the facts\", she said.Mrs Trump said she has \"learned a lot about this matter\" since her letter was first handed to Putin. She said he responded in writing. In her letter, the First Lady wrote: \"Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart... They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.\" The announcement marks a positive development in her advocacy for children from the White House, which began during President Trump's first term. She launched the BE BEST initiative in January 2021, which the White House describes as an awareness campaign focused around the well-being of children globally.Earlier this year, the First Lady led an initiative for Congress to pass a bill banning revenge porn called the Take It Down Act. After the bill was signed, she said it was \"a powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of our children\"."

    "body": "23 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesLawmakers have voted overwhelmingly to oust President Dina BoluartePeru's Congress has voted to remove President Dina Boluarte from office, hours after a late-night session was called to debate her impeachment.An overwhelming majority of lawmakers from across the political spectrum approved her ousting on grounds of \"permanent moral incapacity\".In an address on national television following the vote, Boluarte questioned the implications it would have on the stability of Peru's democracy.One of the world's most unpopular leaders, with an approval rating of 2-4%, Boluarte's tenure has been plagued by frequent protests, scandals and investigations, as well as a surge in gang violence.Anti-government protests have escalated in recent months amid soaring crime. There was renewed anger earlier on Thursday following a shooting at a concert in the capital, Lima.A total of 122 out of 130 lawmakers voted for Boluarte's removal early on Friday, following votes resoundingly in favour of four motions of impeachment.Congress leader Jose Jeri was sworn in as interim president early on Friday. Peru does not currently have a vice-president.Boluarte did not appear before Congress for the overnight hearing. A crowd of protesters brandishing Peruvian flags outside the Congress building erupted in cheers after the vote was declared.\"At all times I have called for unity,\" she told Peruvians after being removed, adding: \"In this context, I had not thought of myself but of the more than 34 million Peruvians who deserve better.\"Protests have punctuated the 63-year-old leader's less than three years in office, which followed the impeachment and imprisonment of her predecessor, Pedro Castillo.Her presidency was overshadowed by several investigations, including a corruption inquiry dubbed \"Rolexgate\" over allegations she accepted Rolex watches as bribes. Another probed whether she abandoned her post when she failed to appoint a caretaker president during an absence for nose surgery. She has denied any wrongdoing.In July, her decision to double her salary to almost 35 times that of the monthly minimum wage in Peru was met with scorn and derision. Her economy minister noted at the time her salary had been the second lowest of 12 countries in South America.ReutersA crowd of protesters outside the Congress building erupted in cheers after the vote was declaredThursday night's successful impeachment bid was the latest in a series of attempts to remove Boluarte from office ahead of elections next April.\"The only way of moving forward is Dina Boluarte's impeachment,\" Congresswoman Susel Paredes said in a post on X on Thursday.Among the lawmakers who voted to remove Boluarte from office were factions once loyal to the president, including conservative parties that had previously supported her.Boluarte rose to power in December 2022, when former President Castillo was impeached after attempting to dissolve Congress to avert his removal. She was elevated to the post as she was vice-president at the time.Peru's first female president, Boluarte was the Andean nation's sixth leader since 2018. Three former leaders are behind bars.In January 2023, weeks after taking office, an inquiry was launched into Boluarte and some of her key ministers on charges of \"genocide, qualified homicide and serious injuries\".It followed the death of more than 50 Castillo supporters in a government crackdown on demonstrations calling for her resignation and fresh elections.In the first three months of her presidency, there were more than 500 protests over her rule.More on this story"

Fellow CCC member and MP Discent Bajila provided more details on the horrific crash to local news site ZimLive.com. He told the publication he had spoken to the injured MPs, who relayed what had happened.\"I spoke to [Madalaboy] Ndebele, who was in the front passenger seat. His recollection is that they hit the elephant on its backside. After the impact, he remembers the elephant turning round and fighting the vehicle. \"This, he believes, is what did the most damage on the top right side of the vehicle and ultimately led to Moyo's fatal injuries,\" Bajila said.The accident took place in an area where elephants are known to roam to and from their home ranges in the north-west of Zimbabwe.Fellow lawmaker Caston Matewu was among those to pay tribute to Moyo, affectionately known as Moyoxide, hailing him as \"one of the hardest working MPs in Parliament\".\"The people of Nkulumani [sic] have been robbed of this great [man],\" Mr Matewu said.The City of Bulawayo, led by mayor David Coltart, said Mr Moyo would be remembered as an \"iconic leader ... and creative\" who \"strove to champion the arts\" in the city and beyond.Mr Moyo was an award-winning poet, educator and arts administrator \"who devoted his life to nurturing Zimbabwe's creative sector\", according to the state-run Herald news site.The other lawmakers involved in Friday's crash have been taken to hospital."

The statement by the Danish defence ministry says the purpose of its military is security, and if necessary, defence in the Nato security alliance.\"The task of the Armed Forces is to ensure security throughout the Kingdom - and, if necessary, to defend Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark within the framework of Nato in all domains,\" the Chief of Defence, Michael Hyldgaard, told Danish public broadcaster DR, without saying who the potential adversaries were.Denmark worked on the new defence package with the governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.It will buy two new Arctic ships, maritime patrol planes, drones and early warning radar.Crucially, a new Arctic command headquarters will be set up in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, alongside a new military unit under Joint Arctic Command in Greenland.In addition, an undersea cable connecting Greenland and Denmark will be funded. The struggle for control of the Arctic is accelerating - and riskier than everGreenland in particular is strategically located between North America and Russia. Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of Denmark.In recent years, there has been increased interest in the vast island's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron.Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. The island has been home to a US radar base since the Cold War and also hosts a large American space facility.US President Donald Trump has suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are \"all over the place\".Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to acquire Greenland, saying the island was \"critical\" for national and economic security.Greenland's prime minister has said the territory is not for sale, adding that \"Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, Jerusalem andBBC Visual Journalism teamGetty ImagesA ceasefire has come into effect for the war in Gaza, after the Israeli government approved a US-brokered deal with Hamas in negotiations that had the personal involvement of US President Donald Trump.The full text of the agreement has not been made public - but part of it has been published by Israeli media.It appears to lack details and in some cases is vague and ambiguous - perhaps on purpose.Even its title, \"Implementation steps for President Trump's proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War\", leaves room for different interpretations.The full title suggests these are steps for the implementation of the 20-point plan that President Trump announced at the White House last week. The document was agreed after negotiations in Egypt over the first phase of the plan, related to a ceasefire, a hostage and prisoner exchange, and a surge in humanitarian aid.However, by highlighting \"Comprehensive end of Gaza war\", the document appears to be announcing the end of the two-year-old war.This paragraph explicitly says the war is over, which sets the scene for future discussions on later stages of the president's plan for Gaza. It appears to suggest that, even if the negotiations reach an impasse, hostilities will not resume.This is crucial as key sticking points remain, including the Israeli demand for Hamas to disarm, the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, and a plan for who will govern the territory. The document does not mention guarantees that could have been given that the conflict will not restart, or what could happen if either side returns to fighting.Speaking after the deal was reached, Hamas's exiled Gaza leader, Khalil Al-Hayya, said he had received assurances from the US and other mediators that the war had ended.Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly said that the conflict is over. Following the approval of the deal by the Israeli government, Netanyahu released a video in which he appeared to threaten to use force if Israel's demands, including Hamas's disarmament, were not met. \"If this is achieved in the easy way, it's all for the better. And if not, it'll be achieved the hard way,\" he said.The document does not mention the next steps for the full implementation of Trump's plan.This appears to leave room for a return of Israeli troops to areas they had withdrawn from if Hamas is seen as not being fully compliant with the deal. It provides no details about what could constitute a violation.And the text does not explicitly rule out air strikes. Prior to the deal, Hamas officials were concerned that there would be a situation like the one in Lebanon, where a ceasefire deal has not prevented near-daily air strikes on people and targets Israel says are linked to Hezbollah, the Shia militia and political movement. The Lebanese government says Israel's actions are violations of the deal, which was also brokered with US help.Despite the demand that all hostages, alive and dead, should be freed within 72 hours of the partial Israeli withdrawal, the text concedes, although not explicitly, that Hamas is unlikely to be able to retrieve all bodies from deceased hostages within that timeframe, allowing the group to share the information it had gathered about those that could not be located.The text does not say what could happen in case of delays in freeing the 20 captives believed to be alive.This suggests the creation of a mechanism to monitor the deal and report any violations.US officials said separately that the US was moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to co-ordinate the multination force. Assuming the hostage and prisoner exchange is completed, the officials said the intention was for a so-called International Stabilisation Force to be built, although this was yet to be agreed between the sides.Next phase of deal unclearThis deal is a significant diplomatic breakthrough led by Trump, who wants to be remembered as the one who brought the conflict to an end. The president employed American leverage to force Netanyahu, who has been accused of sabotaging earlier efforts for a deal, to engage with the negotiations. Hamas came under pressure from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and from a population in desperate need of help.Israel launched the war in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 were taken hostage.Israel's military campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians and including more than 18,000 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.The first phase of the president's plan was, perhaps, the easiest one. Netanyahu was also facing growing domestic pressure, with polls consistently suggesting that the vast majority of Israelis wanted a deal with Hamas and the end of the war. Hamas, meanwhile, was apparently convinced that keeping the hostages had become a burden, giving Israel a reason to continue fighting.What happens next, however, is not clear. Progress will only happen if the Trump administration remains engaged, as both Israel and Hamas have reasons to stall the process. There is momentum, but major obstacles remain."

Israel-Gaza war ceasefire live updatesThe taskforce will be led by US Central Command (Centcom) based in the region, and is intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and also help coordinate humanitarian assistance.The multinational force will inform both the Israelis and Hamas via Egypt and Qatar of the situation on the ground and any potential violations of the truce, one of the officials said.The force is being established under the leadership of Adm Brad Cooper, head of Centcom. He joined the American delegation for part of indirect talks in Egypt earlier this week, one of the officials said. Those talks led to US President Donald Trump announcing on Thursday that Israel and Hamas had \"signed off on the first phase\" of a peace plan he unveiled last week. One of the point's in Trump's 20-point Gaza plan included the US working with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force to immediately deploy in Gaza but this is yet to be agreed between the sides and would only happen if a hostage and prisoner exchange is completed.Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Since then, Israel's massive military offensive has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 18,000 children. These figures are seen as reliable by the UN and other international bodies."

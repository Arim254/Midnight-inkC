    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge16 hours agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" that young Pakistani student admitted all those years ago. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"\"Don't you find it interesting,\" he asked, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "German police have arrested a Lebanese national on suspicion of being a member of Hamas and planning attacks in Europe.The man, named as \"Mohammad S\", was stopped at Berlin's Brandenburg Airport after arriving from Beirut on Friday evening.Federal prosecutors said that in August 2025 he helped procure 300 rounds of ammunition and was involved in an alleged plot to attack Jewish and Israeli institutions.He is due to be brought before a federal judge who will decide on a pretrial detention.Hamas, which controlled Gaza but has been severely weakened by Israeli operations in the territory, is considered a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Israel and many other countries.The militant Palestinian group carried out the attacks on Israel in October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 people taken hostage.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military action.German authorities say \"Mohammad S\" colluded with \"Abed Al G\", one of three alleged Hamas members arrested last October over planned attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions.The three were reportedly arrested while meeting for a weapons handover in Berlin. Two of them are Germany nationals, another is from Lebanon.Around the time of the arrests, police searches also took place in the German cities of Leipzig and Oberhausen, Der Spiegel reported.Separately, in November, German authorities arrested another suspected member of Hamas - also a Lebanese national - near the border with the Czech Republic.",

    "body": "1 day agoReutersZhang Youxia was widely seen as President Xi's closest military allyChina's defence ministry says it has opened an investigation into the country's highest-ranking general over \"grave violations of discipline and the law\".The ministry gave no further details about accusations against General Zhang Youxia, who has widely been seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally. However in China the accusation of wrongdoing is usually a euphemism for corruption.In its announcement, the ministry said another senior military officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also under investigation.Their removal follows the expulsion of nine top generals in October - one of the largest public crackdowns on the military in decades. Zhang, 75, is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by President Xi which controls the armed forces.Zhang also sits on the party's top decision-making body, the 24-person Politburo.His father was one of the founding generals of the Chinese Communist Party.Zhang joined the army in 1968 and is one of only a few senior leaders with combat experience. He was kept in office beyond the customary retirement age for China's military, suggesting President Xi's confidence in him until now.The announcement comes days after rumours appeared that Zhang and Liu could be facing an investigation as they were not present at a high-level party event in December.ReutersPresident Xi has been accused of using corruption investigations to purge political rivalsSince coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives through various departments and this campaign has recently focused heavily on the military.He has called corruption \"the biggest threat\" to the Communist Party and said the fight against it  \"remains grave and complex\".Advocates say the policy promotes good governance, but others believe it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals.With the probe into Zhang and Liu, the CMC is now down from the original seven members to just two: Xi, who is the chairman, and Zhang Shengmin, who is responsible for the military's disciplinary affairs.More from the BBC",

    "body": "18 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal with China. \"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" Trump said on Truth Social. It is unclear what deal Trump is referring to in his social media post. Last week, Canada's Prime Minister Carney announced a \"strategic partnership\" with China, and agreed to reduce tariffs. At the time, Trump called the move \"a good thing\". But tensions between the US and Canada have grown in recent days, after Carney said in a speech in Davos that the US-led world order had been ruptured.Carney also urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", though he did not mention Trump by name.Trump responded to the remarks in his own speech the next day, saying: \"Canada lives because of the United States.\"The US president also withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his new Board of Peace.On Saturday, Trump said in his social media post that if Carney \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken\". The BBC has contacted the White House and Carney's office for comment.Canada's US trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement: \"There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China.\"\"What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues.\"LeBlanc said the government was focused on building a stronger Canadian economy and strengthening trade partnerships \"throughout the world\".Canada has been seeking to diversify trade away from the US, its largest trade partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs.Under the agreement reached between Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, China will lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will  tax Chinese EVs at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.The deal was seen as a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat tariffs, and could see more Chinese investments in Canada.Carney said the progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".",

    "body": "1 day agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandHarry SekulichA young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark.\"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away,\" his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days.\"Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him,\" his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.",

    "body": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has weighed in on a separatist movement in Alberta, saying the western Canadian province is a \"natural partner for the US\". \"Alberta has a wealth of natural resources, but they won't let them build a pipeline to the Pacific,\" Bessent told an American right-wing commentator in an interview on Thursday. \"I think we should let them come down into the US, and Alberta is a natural partner for the US. They have great resources. The Albertans are very independent people.\" The top US official's comments come amid strained ties between US and Canada, and as signatures are being collected in the province seeking an independence referendum. In comments to conservative host Jack Posobiec, Bessent went on to say there is a \"rumour that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not\". A group in Alberta has until May to collect at least 178,000 signatures - or 10% of eligible voters - for a referendum campaign. Asked about Bessent's remarks on Friday, federal Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he'd tell him \"thanks but no thanks, we will do our own things\".He said Canadians are \"able to develop our natural resources at home\" and pointed to a deal recently inked by Prime Minister Mark Carney with Alberta that opens the door for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but one which faces significant hurdles.A spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a statement to the BBC that the province supports new pipelines \"west, east, north, and south, and we will continue to work with our US partners on building more pipeline capacity to US markets\". \"But the premier also believes the overwhelming majority of Albertans are not interested in becoming a US state\".Late last year over 430,000 signatures were gathered for a petition calling for a united Canada to counter the separatist push, and polls indicate a majority of Albertans want to stay in Canada. Many supporters of separatism have also told media they are seeking independence from Canada - not to join the US. Mitch Sylvestre, who is spearheading the referendum petition, told the CBC on Friday he doesn't think anyone in his movement is eyeing the US.He said he thought Bessent's comment on Alberta and the US being \"natural partners\" was obvious given the energy trade between them.Still, some organisers of the movement have said they have travelled to Washington to meet officials from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, trade talks between the US and Canada are on ice, and President Donald Trump has expressed irritation with the prime minister over a blunt speech he delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos calling out \"great powers\" for weaponising their economic might.Trump responded in his own speech with: \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"Other US officials have also criticised Carney's speech, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who this week accused Canada of being \"arrogant\" and Carney of pandering to a domestic audience by adopting an anti-US stance.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, Nyaungshwe, Shan state andJosh CheethamPolls in Myanmar have closed after a third and final stage of voting in what are widely viewed as sham elections.Many popular parties are banned from standing and voting has not been possible in large areas of the country because of a five-year-long civil war.The dominant party backed by the ruling military junta is expected to win a landslide victory.The current regime has rejected international criticism of the election, maintaining that it is free and fair.Around one-fifth of the country's 330 townships, including the cities of Yangon and Mandalay, voted in the last stage. Six parties, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), fielded candidates nationwide, while another 51 parties and independent candidates decided to contest state and regional levels.Two previous rounds were held on 28 December and 11 January - giving overwhelming victories to the USDP.The party won only 6% of parliamentary seats in the last free election in 2020.As in previous rounds of this strange, month-long election, voting was orderly and peaceful at the polling station in Nyaungshwe, Shan State, which a BBC team observed. Set in a large school, shaded by huge rain trees, there were ample volunteers an officials to guide voters where to go, and how to make their choice using the new, locally-made electronic voting machines. You could be forgiven for believing this was a normal democratic exercise, not the sham its critics say it is.However polling day was preceded by a campaigning period marked by fear, intimidation and a pervasive sense that little will change after the inevitable victory by the USDP. Everywhere the BBC team travelled in southern Shan State, we were followed and closely monitored by dozens of police and military officials, always polite but very persistent. It proved nearly impossible to get people to say anything about the vote, so nervous were they of possible repercussions.The next steps after final results are announced are laid down in the military-drafted constitution. Parliament will meet within the next two months to choose a new president, and everyone expects that to be the coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing. It will be the same regime with civilian clothes. But he will then have to relinquish his command of the armed forces. His replacement is certain to be a loyalist, but his hold over the ranks of the military will inevitably be less secure, and it is no secret that many other senior officers do not believe he has made a good job of leading the country. With many more voices in politics, there is the possibility of wider debate inside government over which direction Myanmar should now take, and the possibility - distant for now - of the first steps towards ending the civil war.The military junta took control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup, ousting an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi.She remains in detention and, like many other opposition groups, her National League for Democracy has been formally dissolved.The military has been fighting against both armed resistance groups which oppose the coup and ethnic armies that have their own militias. It lost control of large parts of the country in a series of major setbacks, but clawed back territory this year enabled by support from China and Russia.The civil war has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more, destroyed the economy and left a humanitarian vacuum. A devastating earthquake in March and international funding cuts have made the situation far worse.",

    "body": "1 day agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringUkraine is now living through its most difficult winter in recent memory. With January temperatures plummeting below -15C, Russia has been attacking energy infrastructure, leaving about a million Ukrainians without heating.The capital, Kyiv, is the main target of such attacks. Following the latest Russian bombardment overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. \"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. \"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that.\" She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing.What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators.Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons.In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers.Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing.The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as \"panelki\", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as \"khrushchevki\", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s.Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for \"heat and electricity centrals\" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat.Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as \"private houses\" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities.\"Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised,\" Korolchuk told the BBC. \"These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war.\"According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia.\"During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.",

The building, named Taipei 101 for the number of its floors, is 508m (1,667ft) tall, made of steel, glass and concrete and is designed to resemble a stick of bamboo.Honnold is renowned for being the first person to climb El Capitan without ropes or safety gear. The 915m (3,000 foot) granite cliff is in California's Yosemite national park.The climb was originally set to take place on Saturday but was delayed by wet weather. His ascent in Taiwan's capital was streamed live on Netflix, which said there was a delay on the live feed should the worst happen. \"We'll cut away,\" Netflix executive Jeff Gaspin told Variety magazine in the run-up to the event. \"Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen.\"Honnold completed the climb in one hour and 31 minutes on Sunday - and celebrated the achievement with one word: \"Sick.\"His time more than halves the record of the only other person to scale the tower. Alain Robert, a Frenchman who called himself \"Spiderman\", made it to the top of Taipei 101 - at the time the world's tallest building - in four hours. He did so with ropes and a harness.RITCHIE B TONGO/EPA/ShutterstockGetty ImagesTaiwan's Vice-President Hsiao Bi-khim congratulated Honnold, writing on X: \"I admit I would probably feel sick, too, barely able to watch.\" Honnold was greeted at the top of the building by his wife, who expressed concern for the wind and heat as he climbed.But there was another distraction during his ascent. As Honnold reached the 89th floor, fans cheered and waved, face to face but for the window with the man clinging to the building.Video of the moment was shared by Honnold and Netflix on Instagram, showing the climber continuing undeterred.Honnold has made many extreme climbs during his career.

    "body": "2 days agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoTikTok's new US joint venture has made changes to its privacy policy that include expanding the type of location data the company can collect from its 200 million American users.The new policy was published after investors closed a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance on Thursday to run the popular short-form video app's business in the US.The new joint venture said in its updated privacy terms that it may now \"collect precise location data, depending on your settings\" -  a change from the previous policy which allowed for the collection of \"approximate\" location data.TikTok did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the change. The company policy added that the sensitive personal information would be processed \"in accordance with applicable law\" and that users can turn off location services in their device settings at any time.Even before the new venture was established, TikTok collected location information based on a user's SIM card or IP address, or both.But it stopped short of collecting even approximate GPS information from American users operating the most updated version of the app, according to a 2024 version of its privacy policy.Precise location sharing hasn't yet been enabled in the US, where it is expected to be optional and turned off by default so users will be asked to opt in with a pop-up message. TikTok has not said when the update is due to reach American users.TikTok already collects similar data from users in the UK and Europe as part of a new \"Nearby Feed\" feature that lets users find events and businesses near them.The new American TikTok joint venture is also extending its permissions for gathering information about users interactions with TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI) tools.This includes prompts and questions submitted by users, as well as information about how, when, and where AI content was prompted or created.TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is comprised of three managing investors including cloud computing giant Oracle, which is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and has taken on significant debt to finance its ambitions in the burgeoning space.Oracle is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican megadonor and longtime ally of US President Donald Trump, whose administration helped broker the US TikTok deal.The agreement follows years of tussling between Washington and Beijing that began in Trump's first presidential term, when he tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over national security concerns.In 2024, the US passed a law that required the platform to be banned in the US by January 2025 if ByteDance failed to sell its US operations to American investors.Trump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation until the joint venture was finalised this week.The 2024 law was prompted in part by concerns about the possibility that Beijing might access the data of TikTok's American users.In a statement onThursday, the new joint venture said its mandate was \"to secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures\".Oracle will oversee the retraining of TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm on existing American user data, the joint venture said in its statement, adding that the algorithm \"will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.\"ByteDance retains a minority stake just shy of 20% in the joint venture.Other managing investors include the US tech investment firm Silver Lake and Abu-Dhabi state-owned investment fund MGX, which has done business with the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial.On Friday, Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, expressed concern about ByteDance's ongoing involvement in TikTok's US operations.\"Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm? Can the parties involved assure Americans their data is secure?\" he said in a statement. \"Those are questions that need to be answered as the Select Committee does oversight of this deal.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoJacob PhillipsFamily handoutAlex Pretti was killed in Minneapolis on SaturdayA man who was shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis has been identified by his family as 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti.He has been described as an avid outdoorsman who loved mountain biking and is understood to have joined protests after Renee Good, also 37, was shot dead by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in her car earlier this month.Conflicting accounts have emerged about the moments leading up to his death.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an agent fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they claim had a handgun, resisted attempts to disarm him. Some eyewitnesses and officials, as well as Pretti's family, have challenged that account.Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, his family said in a statement. They told the Associated Press news agency (AP) that he was upset by US President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration in the city. Pretti's mother also said her son cared immensely about the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations.\"He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,\" Susan Pretti told AP. She added: \"He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.\"Pretti had no interactions with law enforcement beyond traffic tickets, family sayPretti loved adventures with his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog Joule, who died around a year ago, AP reported. His family said he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to AP, court records show he had no criminal record.Pretti's parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful while protesting.\"We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,\" his father Michael Pretti told AP. \"And he said he knows that. He knew that.\"Pretti's family also explained he owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota - but they had never known him to carry it.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara also said police believed he was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, the BBC's US partner CBS reported. 'Please get the truth out about our son'After seeing videos suggesting their son was a \"domestic terrorist,\" Pretti's family issued a statement saying \"the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting\".They claimed videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. \"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,\" they urged in their statement.Pretti was a Democratic voter and had taken part in the wave of street protests after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, his ex-wife told AP.She said that he was someone who may shout at law enforcement officers at a protest but had never known him to be physically confrontational.ReutersA woman cries as people gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was shotA US citizen born in Illinois, Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir. He went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to his family.He worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse.His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple of days before he was shot dead when they spoke about repairs he had done to the garage door at his home, AP reported. A Latino man had completed the work and Pretti's parents said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 (£74) tip.Doctor Dmitri Drekonja, who worked with Pretti, told ABC News the pair had bonded over their interest in mountain biking and would compare notes on which trails to ride.\"He was the type of person you enjoyed being around and the notion that this helpful, smiling joking guy was being labelled a terrorist? It's galling,\" he said.ReutersPeople gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was fatally shotNeighbours described Pretti as quiet and warmhearted.\"He's a wonderful person,\" Sue Gitar told AP, who lived downstairs from the nurse and said he moved into the building about three years ago. \"He has a great heart.\"Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbours said.\"I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,\" said Gitar.",

    "body": "Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift1 day agoClaire KeenanReutersHomeland security is the top priority in the Pentagon's new National Defense StrategyThe US will offer \"more limited\" support to allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy.In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern.Previous versions of the strategy -  published every four years - named the threat posed by China as the top defence priority. Relations with China will now be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater \"burden-sharing\" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".Late last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to acquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is \"not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. \"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". ",

    "body": "1 day agoClaire KeenanReutersPolice say they are not expecting to find any more survivors from the landslide Rescue efforts for six missing people buried by a landslide in New Zealand on Thursday have been called off, with efforts now moving to recovering bodies, police have said. \"Tragically it is now apparent that we will not be able to bring them home alive,\" Anderson said, adding that formal identification is underway. Two teenagers are among those who remain unaccounted for, with the youngest aged 15 years old. Search teams located human remains beneath dirt and debris on Friday evening,  Police Superintendent Tim Anderson said, after a landslide hit a popular campsite in Mount Maunganui. \"This is heartbreaking news for the families and the dozens of people who have been working day and night, hoping for a positive outcome,\" Anderson said. In a separate incident, two people died - a grandmother and her grandchild - in a different landslide at Welcome Bay, nearby Mount Maunganui, public service broadcaster Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported. Heavy rain has fallen on New Zealand's North Island for days, with more wet weather forecast for the area over the weekend.Police said conditions have added to the difficulty of rescue efforts, and described the scene at Mount Maunganui as \"incredibly challenging... to work through\". Watch: Footage captures moment landslide starts in Mount Maunganui in New ZealandFire and emergency services worked through the night to locate those unaccounted for at the campsite before the operation was formally handed over to police on Saturday. The safety of workers on the ground is of \"upmost importance\", Anderson said. Police have confirmed the names of the six individuals unaccounted for as Lisa Anne Maclennan, 50, from Morrinsville, Måns Loke Bernhardsson, 20, from Sweden, Jacqualine Suzanne Wheeler, 71, from Rotorua, and Susan Doreen Knowles, 71, from Ngongotaha. The youngest victims have been identified by police as Sharon Maccanico, 15, from Auckland and Max Furse-Kee, 15, from Auckland. ReutersMembers of the public lay floral tributes at scene of the landslide in Mount MaunganuiChief Coroner Judge Anna Tutton confirmed the identification process is underway, but warned it would likely be \"complex\" and \"painstaking\". \"We will work very carefully - and as quickly as we can - to reunite families,\" she said. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon visited the site on Friday. He said it was \"inspiring\" to see the show of community support as locals helped clear debris in flood-hit areas. Mount Maunganui is a sacred Māori site and one of the most popular campgrounds in New Zealand. It has been repeatedly hit by landslides in recent years.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAndrew WhiteheadGetty ImagesSir Mark spent much of his journalistic career covering IndiaThe broadcaster and journalist Sir Mark Tully - for many years known as the BBC's \"voice of India\" - has died at the age of 90.For decades, the rich, warm tones of Sir Mark were familiar to BBC audiences in Britain and around the world - a much-admired foreign correspondent and respected reporter and commentator on India. He covered war, famine, riots and assassinations, the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Indian army's storming of the Sikh Golden Temple.In the small north Indian city of Ayodhya in 1992, he faced a moment of real peril. He witnessed a huge crowd of Hindu hardliners tear down an ancient mosque. Some of the mob - suspicious of the BBC - threatened him, chanting \"Death to Mark Tully\". He was locked in a room for several hours before a local official and a Hindu priest came to his aid.How the Babri mosque destruction shaped IndiaWill English kill off India's languages?The demolition provoked the worst religious violence in India for many decades - it was, he said years later, the \"gravest setback\" to secularism since the country's independence from Britain in 1947.\"We are sad to hear the passing of Sir Mark Tully,\" Jonathan Munro, Interim CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said in a statement. \"As one of the pioneers of foreign correspondents, Sir Mark opened India to the world through his reporting, bringing the vibrancy and diversity of the country to audiences in the UK and around the world.\"His public service commitments and dedication to journalism saw him work as a bureau chief in Delhi, and report for outlets across the BBC. Widely respected in both India and the UK, he was a joy to speak with and will be greatly missed.\"India was where Sir Mark was born - in what was then Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1935. He was a child of the British Raj. His father was a businessman. His mother had been born in Bengal - her family had worked in India as traders and administrators for generations.He was brought up with an English nanny who once chided him for learning to count by copying the family's driver: \"that's the servants' language, not yours\", he was told. He eventually became fluent in Hindi, a rare achievement in Delhi's foreign press corps and one which endeared him to many Indians for whom he was always \"Tully sahib\". His good cheer and evident affection for India won him the friendship and trust of many of the top rank of the country's politicians, editors and social activists.Sir Mark, seen here with members of India's armed forces, arrived in India as an administrative assistant at the BBC in 1965Throughout his life, he performed a balancing act: English, without doubt; but not - he insisted - an expat who was passing through India. He had roots there; it was his home. It's where he lived for three-quarters of his life.Immediately after World War Two, at the age of nine, Sir Mark came to Britain for his education. He studied history and theology at Cambridge and then headed to theological college with the aim of being ordained as a clergyman before he - and the church - had second thoughts.He was sent to India for the BBC in 1965 - at first as an administrative assistant, but in time he began to take on a reporting role. His broadcasting style was idiosyncratic, but his strength of character and his insight into India shone through.Some critics said he was too indulgent of India's poverty and caste-based inequality; others admired his clearly expressed commitment to the religious tolerance upon which independent India was anchored. It's \"really important to treasure the secular culture of this country, allowing every religion to flourish,\" he told an Indian newspaper in 2016. \"... we must not endanger this by insisting on Hindu majoritarianism\".Getty ImagesSir Mark's was a familiar voice for BBC listeners in the UK and around the worldSir Mark was never an armchair correspondent. He travelled relentlessly across India and neighbouring countries, by train when he could. He gave voice to the hopes and fears, trials and tribulations, of ordinary Indians as well as the country's elite. He was as comfortable wearing an Indian kurta as in a shirt and tie.He was expelled from India at 24 hours' notice in 1975 after the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered a state of emergency. But he headed back 18 months later and had been based in Delhi ever since. He spent more than 20 years as the BBC's head of bureau in Delhi, leading the reporting not simply of India but of South Asia, including the birth of Bangladesh, periods of military rule in Pakistan, the Tamil Tigers' rebellion in Sri Lanka and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Over time, he became increasingly out of step with the BBC's corporate priorities, and in 1993 he made a much-publicised speech accusing the then director general, John Birt, of running the corporation by \"fear\". It marked a parting of the ways. Sir Mark resigned from the BBC the following year. But he continued to broadcast on BBC airwaves notably as presenter of Radio 4's Something Understood, turning back to issues of faith and spirituality which had engaged him as a student.Getty ImagesSir Mark stayed on in Delhi after he left the BBCUnusually for a foreign national, Sir Mark was accorded two of India's top civilian honours: the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan. Britain too gave him recognition. He was knighted for services to broadcasting and journalism in the 2002 New Year's honours list. He described the award as \"an honour to India\".He continued to write books about India - essays, analyses, short stories too, sometimes in collaboration with his partner, Gillian Wright. He lived un-ostentatiously in south Delhi.Sir Mark never gave up his British nationality but was proud also to become late in life an Overseas Citizen of India. That made him, he said, \"a citizen of the two countries I feel I belong to, India and Britain\".Read more on the story",

    "body": "A woman who raped and murdered 12 year-old Lola Daviet in Paris has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in a case that has shocked France. Dahbia Benkired, aged 27, must spend at least 30 years in prison after a panel of judges and a jury decided to impose the country's harshest possible penalty.A whole-life term is extremely rare in France and Benkired is the first woman to receive it.Those who have been given the sentence include serial killer and rapist Michel Fourniret and jihadist Salah Abdeslam, who took part in the 2015 Paris attacks which killed 130 people.Following the verdict, Lola's mother Delphine Daviet said: \"We believed in justice and we got it.\" Her brother Thibault, added: \"We have restored the memory of my sister, we have restored the truth.\"Warning: This story contains distressing detailsLola was murdered in October 2022. Her body was discovered in a plastic storage box in the courtyard of the building where she lived in north-eastern Paris. Benkired is an Algerian immigrant who was under orders to leave the country. French right-wing and far-right politicians have seized on the case.The prosecutor in trial had argued for Benkired to received the longest sentence possible. Benkired was examined by psychiatric experts and found to have \"psychopathic\" traits but otherwise sane.The prosecutor told a panel of three judges and six jurors: \"Make no mistake no drug treatment can fundamentally transform Ms Benkired's personality. When there is no illness, there is no treatment.\"Before jurors began their deliberations on Friday, Benkired told the court: \"I ask for forgiveness and what I did is horrible.\"That's all I have to say.\"CCTV footage from the afternoon of 14 October, 2022 showed Benkired, then 24 years-old, approaching Lola after she returned home from school.According to reports, Benkired lured Lola into an apartment her older sister was sub-letting in the building.   Over an hour-and-a-half, Benkired subjected the 12-year-old to a sexual assault before attacking her with scissors and a box cutter.Benkired bound Lola with duct tape, including around her head, leading to her death by asphyxiation.As he read out the verdict, the presiding judge referred to the \"extreme cruelty of the criminal acts\" which he described as \"true torture\".\"In determining the appropriate sentence, the court took into account the unspeakable psychological damage to the victim and her family in such violent and almost unspeakable circumstances,\" he said.Benkired was in France on a student visa but had failed to renew it. In July 2022, she was stopped at an airport in Paris and was given 30 days to leave the country. Days after Lola's murder in October that year, Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally party wrote on X that the woman \"had no business being in France\". Hard-right rival Éric Zemmour also took to social media to write: \"Lola's murderer should never have crossed her path.\"France's Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticised the \"indecency\" of politicians who, he said, \"should reflect on the consequences of their words\". Lola's mother and her father, Johan Daviet, denounced \"any use of the name and image of [our] child for political ends\".Mr Daviet died in 2024, aged 49.",

    "body": "The US has placed sanctions on Colombia's left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking. \"President Petro has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.Sanctions have also been imposed on Colombia's Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, as well as Petro's wife and eldest son. They include barring them from accessing assets and properties they may have in the US.Colombia was once a close ally of Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance. But Petro and Trump have clashed frequently since Trump's return to power.Bessent said that since Petro, a former guerrilla, came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\". He added that Trump was taking \"strong action\" and \"would not tolerate\" drug trafficking into the US. The Treasury said Colombia was the world's top exporter of cocaine, which it says poses a \"significant drug threat\" to the US.In a separate statement on Friday, the state department said it would will not certify Colombia's counter-narcotics efforts.Petro denied the accusations. In a post on X, he  said he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and had helped the US to reduce its cocaine consumption.\"A complete paradox - but not one step back, and never on our knees,\" he said. In recent weeks, the US military has ratcheted up activity in the southern Caribbean, striking vessels in international waters that it has alleged, without evidence, are carrying drugs.Last week Trump announced the suspension of payments and subsidies to Colombia. This came after Petro told BBC News in September airstrikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean were an \"act of tyranny,\", accusing US officials of murdering a Colombian citizen and violating his country's sovereignty. Imposing sanctions on a head of state is rare but not unprecedented. The leaders of countries including Russia, North Korea and Venezuela have previously been sanctioned. ",

    "body": "A German company inadvertently embroiled in the Louvre Museum heist after one of its lifts was used in the theft is making the most of its free publicity - by launching a new advertising campaign.Werne-based firm Böcker this week published a social media post featuring the now-famous image of its furniture ladder extending up to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo. \"When you need to move fast,\" reads a banner under the image. \"The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min - quiet as a whisper.\"Video has emerged of the alleged thieves escaping on the mechanical ladder after stealing €88m worth (£76m; $102m) of France's crown jewels on Sunday.The company's managing director, Alexander Böcker, told news agency AFP on Wednesday that, when it became clear no one was injured in the heist, it had used \"a touch of humour\" to draw attention to the family-run business.\"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us,\" Mr Böcker said.\"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company.\" How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Reaction to Böcker's new campaign has been enthusiastic, with responses on social media including \"marketing genius\" and \"excellent, that is German quality\".\"Your messaging takes the crown,\" one commenter quipped.Mr Böcker told AFP that he recognised his company's device from news reports, saying the machine was sold \"a few years ago to a French customer who rents this type of equipment in Paris and the surrounding area\".The alleged jewel thieves had arranged to have the machine demonstrated to them last week and had stolen it during the demonstration, he said.The thieves arrived at the Louvre on Sunday shortly after the museum opened its doors.Within eight minutes, they had made off with some of France's most valuable treasures, including those belonging to former royalty and imperial rulers.Among the eight items stolen were diadems, necklaces, earrings and brooches adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.The Louvre reopened on Wednesday, a few days after what has been called France's most shocking theft.The museum's director admitted on Wednesday that security failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft and that CCTV around its perimeter was weak and \"aging\".\"We failed these jewels,\" Laurence des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she added.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors said they believed the robbers acted under orders from a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James appeared in court in US District Court in Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday during a brief hearing where her legal team asked for a speedy trial.  Speaking outside of the courthouse after the arraignment, James accused Trump of using the justice system as a \"vehicle of retribution\" against her and other critics.She previously brought brought charges against others he considers political enemies.  \"There's no fear today,\" she said, as supporters outside cheered. On Friday, a judge set a trial date of 26 January.The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence, and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home.The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but instead was \"used as a rental investment property\" and was being rented to a family of three.The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.Sources have told US media that James bought the home for her great-niece in 2020 and that the relative never paid rent for the home. James' legal team also said in court filings this week that they plan to challenge the appointment of US attorney Lindsey Halligan to James' case. Trump appointed Ms Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert reportedly was ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.James' attorneys also are filing a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that it is \"vindictive\". She is one of several Trump critics who are under investigation or have faced criminal charges in recent weeks. The justice department charged Trump's former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey with making false statements to Congress. Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, is charged with sending and wilfully retaining national defence information.Trump last month called on his social media site Truth Social for Attorney General Pam Bondi, to bring charges against his political opponents. \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.James brought a civil fraud case against Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, in 2022. Trump was later found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£376m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud.",

    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

She passed away \"peacefully\" in a Bangkok hospital at 21:21 local time (14:21 GMT) on Friday, according to the Thai Royal Household Bureau.Sirikit had \"suffered several illnesses\" while in hospital since 2019, including a blood infection this month, it added.For more than six decades, Queen Sirikit was married to Thailand's longest-reigning monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016.King Vajiralongkorn has ordered the Thai Royal Household Bureau to organise a royal funeral, the statement added.Queen Sirikit's body will lie in state at the Grand Palace's Dusit Thorne Hall in Bangkok, according to the palace.Thai royal family members will also observe a year of mourning.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has cancelled his trip to a South East Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia due to Queen Sirikit's death.ReutersGetty ImagesQueen Sirikit married the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1950As a young queen, Sirikit was regarded as a fashion iconQueen Sirikit met her future husband, King Bhumibol, while studying music in Paris, where her father was stationed as Thai ambassador to France.\"It was hate at first sight,\" she said in a 1980 BBC documentary about the Thai monarchy, Soul of a Nation, adding that he had arrived late to their first meeting. \"Because he said he would arrive at four o'clock in the afternoon. He arrived at seven o'clock, kept me standing there, practising curtsy and curtsy,\" she said.The couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before King Bhumibol was crowned in Bangkok.As a young couple in the 1960s, Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol travelled around the world, meeting US president Dwight Eisenhower, the late Queen Elizabeth II - as well as Elvis Presley.During that decade, she frequently made international best dressed lists.In the rare 1980 interview with the BBC, she also described the relationship between the monarchy and people in Thailand, which continues to observe strict lese-majeste laws forbidding insult of the monarchy. She said: \"Kings and queens of Thailand have always been in close contact with the people and they usually regard the king as the father of the nation.\"That is why we do not have much private life, because we are considered father and mother of the nation.\"She was seen as a key maternal figure for the country, with her birthday, 12 August, marked as Mother's Day since 1976.In 2008, she attended the funeral of an anti-government protester killed in violent clashes with police. Queen Sirikit suffered a stroke in 2012, after which she was rarely seen in public.She is survived by her son and three daughters. ",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship2 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a war\", after it sent the world's largest warship towards the Caribbean in a major escalation of its military build-up in the region.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which can carry up to 90 aircraft, to move from the Mediterranean on Friday.\"They are fabricating a new eternal war,\" Maduro told state media. \"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war.\"The US has been increasing its military presence in the Caribbean, sending warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft in what it says is a campaign to target drug traffickers.It has also carried out ten airstrikes on boats it says belong to traffickers, including one on Friday when Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed.That operation took place in the Caribbean Sea, against a ship Hegseth said belonged to the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation. The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. The Trump administration says it is conducting a war on drug trafficking, but it has also been accused by both experts and members of Congress of launching an intimidation campaign in an effort to destabilise Maduro's government.Maduro is a longtime foe of Trump, and the US president has accused him of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation which he denies.ANALYSIS: What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?\"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up is intended to \"strike fear\" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.In its Friday announcement, the Pentagon said the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle TCOs\", or transnational criminal organisations, spokesman Sean Parnell said.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroThe carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela.\"We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" he said earlier this week.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.The aircraft carrier last publicly transmitted its location three days ago off the coast of Croatia, in the Adriatic Sea.Its deployment marks a significant escalation in the US military buildup in the region. It is also likely to increase tensions with Venezuela, whose government Washington has long accused of harbouring drug traffickers.The carrier's large aircraft load can include jets and planes for transport and reconnaissance. Its first long-term deployment was in 2023.It is unclear which vessels will accompany it when it moves to the region, but it can operate as part of a strike group that includes destroyers carrying missiles and other equipment.The US has carried out a series of strikes on boats in recent weeks, in what President Donald Trump has described as an effort to curtail drug trafficking.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike announced on Friday was the tenth the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic US senators wrote to the White House and alleged the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval.Trump said he has the legal authority to order the strikes, and has designated Tren de Aragua a terrorist organisation.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that \"if people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States\".The six deaths in the operation Hegseth announced on Friday brings the total people killed in the US strikes to at least 43.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has not appeared willing to challenge Trump on. \"The US is experiencing an Article 1 crisis,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back.\" ",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterMike CallicrateMike Callicrate, a cattle rancher who has built a direct-to-consumer operation, at his farm in St Francis, Kansas.Beef prices have gotten so high in the US that it has become a political problem.Even Donald Trump, who long ago declared inflation \"dead\", is talking about it, as the issue threatens to undercut his promises to bring down grocery prices for Americans.This week, he took to social media, urging ranchers to lower prices for their cattle.But his demand - and other proposals his administration has floated to address the issue - has sparked a backlash among ranchers, who worry some of his solutions will make it harder for them to make a living, while making little dent at the grocery store.The number of beef cattle farmers and ranchers in the US has dwindled steadily since 1980, reducing domestic supplies and driving up prices, as demand remains high. The country's cattle inventory has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 75 years, while the US has lost more than 150,000 cattle ranches just since 2017 - a 17% drop, according to the Agriculture Department.Ranchers say they are under pressure from four decades of consolidation among the meat processors that buy their livestock, while high costs for key inputs like fertiliser and equipment have intensified the strain.The contraction in the industry has worsened, as several years of drought have forced ranchers to slash their herds.Christian Lovell, a cattle rancher in Illinois, said parts of his farm that were lush and grassy when he was a child have now dried up, limiting where his cows can graze.\"You put all these together and you have a recipe for a really broken market,\" said Mr Lovell, who works with advocacy group Farm Action.Beef inflationRetail prices for ground beef rose 12.9% over the 12 months to September, and beef steaks were up 16.6%, according to US inflation data published Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.A pound of ground chuck now costs an average of $6.33 (£4.75), compared with $5.58 a year ago. The increases have significantly outpaced general food inflation, which stood at 3.1%.\"The cattle herd has been getting smaller for the last several years, yet people are still wanting that American beef - hence the high prices,\" said Brenda Boetel, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls.Derrell Peel, a professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University said he expected prices to remain elevated until at least the end of the decade, noting that it takes years to replenish herds.The Trump administration's \"hands are tied\" when it comes to interventions that will help lower prices, Mr Peel added.ReutersUS President Donald Trump with Javier Milei, president of Argentina, which accounts for just 2% of American beef imports'Chaos' for American producersThe Agriculture Department this week unveiled what it called a \"big package\" aimed at ramping up domestic beef production, by opening more land for cattle grazing and supporting small meat processors.That proposal came after Trump drew the ire of ranchers when he proposed to import more beef from Argentina, potentially quadrupling the purchases.Eight House Republicans responded with a letter to the White House expressing concern about Trump's import plans.Even the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, which has voiced support for Trump's policies in the past, said the import plan \"only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices\".Trump responded by assuring farmers that he was helping them in other ways, noting tariffs that are limiting imports from Brazil.\"It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also,\" Trump wrote.But that has failed to quell the furore. Justin Tupper, president of the US Cattlemen's Association, said he thought that only the big four meat packers would benefit from Trump's import plan. \"I don't see that lowering prices here at all,\" Mr Tupper said.'These are consolidated markets'Some say the government could make an impact if it focused on the way a handful of companies dominate the market for meat processing.Today, just four companies control more than 80% of the beef slaughtering and packing market.\"These are consolidated markets gouging ranchers and gouging consumers at the store,\" said Austin Frerick, an agricultural and antitrust policy expert and a fellow at Yale University.The meat processing firms - Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef - have faced several lawsuits, including one filed by McDonald's alleging they colluded to inflate the price of beef. Though Trump revoked a Biden-era order earlier this year that directed agencies to tackle corporate consolidation across the food system, his administration has taken other steps to investigate competition issues in the agricultural industry.'We're not going to rebuild this cow herd'Mike Callicrate runs a cattle ranch in St Francis, Kansas. He said the only way he has managed to stay in the industry was by cutting out the middleman and setting up his own stores to reach consumers directly.But Mr Callicrate acknowledged that most ranchers do not have the money to make that shift. Many have left the industry - and see no incentive to jump back in.\"We're not going to rebuild this cow herd - not until we address market concentration,\" Mr Callicrate said.He said he supported the Agriculture Department's plans to open up more cattle grazing land to boost production and bring down retail prices.\"But unless we have a market,\" he added, you're a \"fool to get into the cattle business\"Bill BullardBill Bullard, the chief executive of R-CALF USA, a cattle producer trade association, said ranchers have seen a recovery in cattle prices over the past year.Bill Bullard found himself in the first wave of ranchers pushed out as the meat processing industry started to consolidate in the early 1980s. He closed down his 300-cow operation in South Dakota in 1985.Mr Bullard, who is now the chief executive of R-CALF USA, a cattle producer trade association, said it was only in the last year or so that ranchers had received good prices for their livestock, as supply dropped to such a low level that the prices paid by meat processors \"simply had to increase\".Still, reliance on imports and meat packers' buying power persist, Mr Bullard said, meaning ranchers \"lack confidence in the integrity of the marketplace\" and remain reluctant to grow their herds.He said he did not have confidence that the president's ideas would fix the issues.\"He's focused on the symptoms and not the problems,\" he said.",

    "body": "6 hours agoWill GrantMexico, Central America and Cuba correspondentIn a late-night communique on Thursday, the Cuban Government said that it had extradited a Chinese citizen, Zhi Dong Zhang, to the authorities in Mexico. Hours later, Mexico's security chief then confirmed his subsequent extradition to the United States on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.It brought to an abrupt end a months-long, audacious escape attempt by one of the world's most wanted fugitives.Known by various aliases including Brother Wang, Pancho and HeHe, Zhi Dong Zhang is accused by the US Justice Department of masterminding a vast international ring of fentanyl trafficking and money laundering covering numerous nations but particularly China, Mexico and the US.The list of charges against Mr Zhang is long but in essence US prosecutors and the Mexican Attorney General's office accuse him of being a major player in the global drug trade. They say he has laundered millions of dollars in drug money for both the Sinaloa Cartel and the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG) as part of a worldwide drug distribution network.\"Brother Wang can be seen as a key link between Mexican cartels and Chinese chemical companies in sourcing the pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl\", explains former DEA agent, Mike Vigil, adding that he was also vital in converting drug funds into cryptocurrency.If convicted, Zhi Dong Zhang can expect to share a similar fate as other drug kingpins like Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman and Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada in a high-security facility in the United States.But how 'Brother Wang' ended up in custody in Havana is an extraordinary tale involving fleeing house arrest in Mexico City, reportedly through a hole in a wall, taking a private jet to Cuba and an ultimately failed attempt to enter Russia.Zhi Dong Zhang was arrested in Mexico City in a joint security operation in October 2024. He was initially held in a maximum-security prison but was later granted house arrest by a judge – a decision that President Claudia Sheinbaum called \"outrageous\".Zhang's escape had all the hallmarks of another embarrassing episode for Mexico: a man considered a vital cog in the machinery of drug smuggling, able to disappear from under the noses of the Mexican authorities tasked with guarding him. El Chapo Guzman managed that feat twice, much to Washington's frustration, before he was finally put on a plane in handcuffs to the US.That Mexican authorities were able to recover their prisoner and send him north came down to two things – an apparent stroke of luck in Russia and the strength of Mexico's security relationship with Havana.When Zhang reached Cuba in July 2025, he set about making his next steps towards reaching a country with no extradition treaty with the US, officials say. There is a direct commercial flight to Moscow from Havana and Zhang, they allege, was able to secure a seat on it using fake papers. However, the papers didn't get him past the immigration authorities in Russia. It has been reported that the Russians didn't fully appreciate who they had in their custody and, after he was briefly detained, they turned Zhang around and sent him back to Cuba.On arriving back in Havana a second time, the Cuban security services were now aware of his real identity.Security analysts believe the authorities in Cuba held onto him for several months to interrogate him at length before sending him back to Mexico and, inevitably, onwards to the US. Mexico's Public Security Secretary, Omar Harfuch, was quick to thank Cuba for their cooperation over 'Brother Wang' – ultimately, for sparing their blushes over another escaped high-profile prisoner.As always following the arrest of an alleged kingpin, the question becomes how far their removal will affect the global drug trade.Given Brother Wang has spent the past year either in prison, under house arrest or on the run, the question may be moot, Mr Vigil said, as his absence has already largely been felt in Mexico's criminal underworld:\"It's really not going to have an impact as the cartels already have individuals working for them who can start to replace to Brother Wang,\" said Mr Vigil. \"Even in the case of El Chapo Guzman who was a much bigger figure, it had no impact on the global drug trade\", he argues.Over his first year in office, US President Donald Trump has pressured his Mexican counterpart to do more on the issue of fentanyl trafficking and President Sheinbaum's administration has duly responded in kind. She has significantly increased seizures of the drug compared to her predecessor and her administration has sent dozens of convicted drug cartel members to the US to serve sentences there. They included several high-level drug names like Rafael Caro Quintero, wanted for the murder of a DEA agent in 1985.Her co-operation on the fentanyl issue, as well as on undocumented immigration, is considered the reason Mr Trump has refrained from imposing the same level of trade tariffs on Mexico as he has on other commercial partners.Brother Wang's extradition will bring genuine satisfaction in Washington at having taken a key figure in Mexican cartels' financial operations out of circulation. That, in turn, will please the Sheinbaum administration in Mexico and strengthen their claim to be in lockstep with their US counterparts on security.However, slowing or reducing the movement of pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl from China to the Americas in any lasting way will take more than the extradition of one man.",

    "body": "23 hours agoMallory MoenchWatch: FBI director announces alleged schemes involving NBA players and MafiaAn NBA player and coach are among dozens of people arrested as part of a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and allegedly rigged, mafia-linked poker games.Miami Heat player Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were named by federal prosecutors in two separate indictments on Thursday. Both men deny the allegations.Rozier, 31, is among six people arrested over alleged betting irregularities. They include NBA players accused of faking injuries to influence gambling markets. Billups, a Hall of Fame player turned coach, is one of 31 people charged in a separate illegal poker game case involving retired players and the mafia.That case, which prosecutors said involved four of the five major crime families in New York, uncovered an alleged scheme to lure victims into playing rigged poker games alongside high-profile sports stars before stealing millions of dollars. They did so using technology including special contact lenses and glasses that could read pre-marked cards and an X-ray table, according to authorities.The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were being placed on immediate leave as it reviews the federal indictments.\"We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,\" it said.Rozier's lawyer denied the allegations to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, saying: \"Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.\"He appeared in federal court in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday and was released on bail after he put up his Florida home – valued at $6m (£4.5m) – as collateral, according to local media. Billups, who has coached the Portland Trail Blazers since 2021, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, and arraigned in court on Thursday, according to local media. He is expected to prepare a substantial bond for his release, too. His lawyer Chris Heywood also denied the accusations, telling CBS in a statement: \"He will fight these allegations with the same tenacity that marked his 28-year career. We look forward to our day in court.\"Getty ImagesTerry Rozier - better known to some fans as \"Scary Terry\" - is a current NBA player for MiamiFBI Director Kash Patel held a news conference with other prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday where he announced the two indictments. He called the arrests \"extraordinary\" and said there was a \"co-ordinated takedown across 11 states\".\"We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft and robbery across a multi-year investigation,\" he said.US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Joseph Nocella Jr, said all defendants were innocent until proven guilty, but warned: \"Your winning streak has ended. Your luck has run out.\"NBA games under scrutinyProsecutors said the first case involved players and associates who allegedly used  information not available to the public to manipulate bets on major gambling platforms.Nocella called it \"one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes since online sports betting became widely legalised\".What we know about the arrestsSeven NBA games between February 2023 and March 2024 have been identified as part of the case. Rozier is said to have been involved in one between the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans, when he was playing for the Hornets.Rozier is alleged to have told a friend that he would leave the game early due to injury. The friend and his associates then placed bets, or directed others to bet, \"more than $200,000\" that Rozier would underperform expectations in the game, prosecutors said. He left the game after nine minutes, they said, which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in betting profits for those involved.During the game, Rozier scored just five points before going off because of a sore right foot, according to the official NBA match report.Before that game, he averaged 35 minutes of playing time and about 21 points per game.\"As the NBA season tips off, his career is already benched, not for injury but for integrity,\" New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.ReutersPortland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups is accused of involvement in rigged poker gamesRozier's lawyer James Trusty said in a statement that prosecutors \"appear to be taking the word of spectacularly in-credible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case\". Mr Trusty said he had been representing Rozier for more than a year and said prosecutors characterised Rozier as a subject, not a target, until they informed him FBI agents were arresting the player at a hotel on Thursday morning.Former NBA player Damon Jones was also arrested as part of the investigation.Jones is said to have been involved in two of the identified games - when the Los Angeles Lakers met the Milwaukee Bucks in February 2023, and a January 2024 game between the Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder.Sports betting was outlawed in most of the US from 1992 until 2018, when the Supreme Court turned regulation of the practice over to the states. Since the federal ban was struck down, sports betting has exploded with major sports leagues and media companies making deals with gambling firms to get in on the billion-dollar industry.Rigged poker games and the mafiaThe second indictment announced on Thursday involves 31 defendants alleged to have participated in a scheme to rig illegal poker games and steal millions of dollars.The case involved 13 members and associates of the Bonanno, Genovese and Gambino crime families in New York.Nocella said the targeted victims were lured to play games with former professional athletes, including Billups and Jones, in Las Vegas, Miami, Manhattan and the Hamptons.Victims were \"fleeced\" out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game, he said.He said defendants used \"very sophisticated technology\" like altered off-the-shelf shuffling machines that could read the cards. Some of the defendants used special contact lenses and glasses to read marked cards, and an X-ray table that could read cards when they were face-down.\"What [the victims] didn't know is that everybody else at the poker game - from the dealer to the players were in on the scam,\" Nocella said.Tisch said that, when people refused to pay, the organised crime families used threats and intimidation to get them to hand over the money.The charges include robbery, extortion, wire fraud, bank fraud and illegal gambling.The conspiracy cheated victims out of $7m, with one losing $1.8 million, officials said.\"This is only the tip of the iceberg,\" Christopher Raia, the FBI assistant director of the New York field office, said, adding that the FBI was working hard to ensure members of mafia families \"cannot continue to wreak havoc in our communities\".",

    "body": "From government spin doctor to Cameroon president's main rival11 hours agoPaul Njie,BBC Africa, Garoua and Wedaeli ChibelushiIssa Tchiroma Bakary: ‘We will never accept stolen votes’Cameroon's opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who has declared himself the winner of the 12 October elections, has told the BBC that he will not accept a stolen vote, with the results due to be announced on Monday.He says his team has compiled the overall picture based on results from individual polling stations, so there is no doubt.Tchiroma Bakary, 76, is a former government minister who broke ranks with President Paul Biya, 92, who is seeking another term after 43 years in power.The ruling party has dismissed Tchiroma Bakary's victory claims and several officials have described it as illegal because only the Constitutional Council can proclaim official results.In an interview at his home, in the northern city of Garoua, Tchiroma Bakary said he had urged his supporters to defend their votes.\"We will never accept their votes being stolen by anyone,\" he said, dressed in a long, flowing white and gold tunic.The former minister said he was not concerned about being arrested or put in jail, \"but I know that I have already won the presidential election\".\"There is no doubt, no shadow of doubt whatsoever. My victory is undeniable,\" he said, appearing placid and resolute throughout the conversation.Can Biya, the world's oldest president, keep his title?Tchiroma Bakary said the ruling CPDM party had \"their backs against the wall\" and could not accept the reality of the vote, and challenged them to show if what he was saying about the election was wrong.He defended his decision to declare himself himself the winner, insisting that the law \"does not prevent us from so doing\".Tchiroma Bakary has previously said he won the election with about 55% of the vote, based on returns representing 80% of the electorate.Asked whether he would accept defeat if someone else is declared the winner, he said he would agree \"provided the Constitutional Council announces the results that comes from the ballot box, not ballot stuffing\".Tensions over the delayed announcement of the election results have been growing, sparking fears of post-electoral violence in a country already rocked by a separatist conflict in the Anglophone regions and Boko Haram insurgency in the Far North region.In Garoua, a general feeling of uncertainty lingers following protests earlier this week. Security forces patrol the streets during the night, although their presence in the day time has decreased.The highly respected and influential Catholic Church in Cameroon this week urged calm following fears that violence could erupt once official results are declared.Catholic bishops said they hoped the official result would reflect the will of the electorate, and \"nothing will be changed by any authority involved in this exercise\".AFPIncumbent President Paul Biya only showed up to one rally during the campaign period, accompanied by his wife, ChantalBorn in Garoua, Tchiroma Bakary trained as an engineer in France before returning to Cameroon to work for the national railway company.In 1984, he was thrown in jail, accused of being involved in an attempt to depose President Biya. Despite denying the allegation and never being convicted, Tchiroma Bakary spent six years in prison. There, he farmed the land with his fellow inmates and taught himself how to speak English.On his release from prison, Tchiroma Bakary began his political career. He became an MP for the opposition UNDP in 1992, but entered an alliance of sorts with Biya and served as his minister of transport for four years.Tchiroma Bakary also served as communications minister from 2009 to 2019.As communications minister and the government's spokesperson, he resolutely defended Biya's government during crises such as the Boko Haram insurgency, when the army was accused of killing civilians.But in June, just four months before the general elections, Tchiroma Bakary changed course dramatically, resigning from the government and announcing he would run against Biya for the presidency.He accused the president of becoming increasingly out of touch, saying \"a country cannot exist in the service of one man\".Despite his recent role as the government's mouthpiece, Tchiroma Bakary drew huge crowds at his rallies, electrifying voters desperate for change.After four decades of Biya's rule, economic development has stagnated and challenges such as inflation, unemployment and insecurity abound.AFP via Getty ImagesTchiroma Bakary's supporters see him as a symbol of changeAdditionally, residents in the English-speaking western region of Cameroon have long complained of marginalisation, and so many there automatically backed Tchiroma Bakary against Biya, seen as representing the French-speaking majority.At one rally in the economic capital of Douala, thousands of supporters waited for hours in the rain to hear Tchiroma Bakary speak. He knows how to command a crowd - a stark contrast to Biya, who spent most of the campaign period in Europe and only showed up for one rally.Some are not so taken with the former spokesperson, however. In his home city of Garoua, a couple of residents told the BBC that Tchiroma Bakary was not their ideal candidate, but at least he offered a change from Biya's lengthy rule.\"We can't continue with the level of underdevelopment that is crippling Cameroon,\" said farmer Benjamin Temunga.Tchiroma Bakary has also sought to distance himself from the government, apologising for his role as its spokesperson.For instance, he defended the military despite knowing they were committing atrocities in amid the Anglophone crisis - a conflict that has seen separatist fighters battling the authorities for more than six years.\"I 100% agree that the military committed atrocities,\" he said. \"But as Minister of Communication, my duty was to defend our armed forces. Today, I speak as a free man.\"Calm and plain-speaking, Tchiroma Bakary is resolute in his stance that the people have put their trust in him. He is the rightful president, he tells the BBC. \"The nation knows it, the world knows it.\"Additional reporting by Basillioh RukangaYou may also be interested in:The African president who keeps defying death rumoursAre Africa's leaders too old to govern the young?Why African leaders maintain secrecy around their healthGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Attacks on people like me happen every time my country has an election5 hours agoAlfred LasteckBBC Africa, Northern TanzaniaBBCFresh trauma arrives with every election season in Tanzania for 42-year-old Mariam Staford.For most, the fiesta-like rallies and songs, along with the campaign messages, signal a chance for people to make their voice heard. But for those with albinism, they bring terror.Warning: This article contains details of graphic violence that some people may find upsetting\"The first thing that comes to me is fear,\" Mariam tells the BBC as people prepare to vote for a president and parliament on Wednesday.\"I know that killings of people with albinism happen especially at election time in Tanzania, when witchcraft beliefs intensify. That's why I don't take part in campaigns… I am so afraid.\"Albinism, which affects an estimated 30,000 people in Tanzania, is a rare genetic condition that reduces melanin - the pigment that gives colour to skin, eyes and hair.Superstition has made those with the condition targets. The false belief that body parts of people with albinism bring wealth, luck, or political success have driven attacks and killings across Tanzania.Activists say such assaults intensify in the run-up to an election as people vie for political influence.Mariam knows what this danger looks and feels like personally.In 2008, one of the bloodiest years for people with albinism in Tanzania as preparations for local elections were under way, machete-wielding men stormed into her bedroom in Kagera, a north-western border region.\"They came at a late hour of the night, cut off my right hand [from above the elbow] and took it away, and then they also cut off my left hand.\"The next day I was taken to a dispensary, unconscious, and the doctor who saw me said: 'This person is already dead, take her back home and bury her'\".Against the odds, Mariam survived; but she was five months pregnant and her unborn child did not.AFP via Getty ImagesCampaigning is under way for Wednesday's electionsThe attack not only left her with permanent disabilities but forced her to abandon Kagera, one of the epicentres of ritualistic killings of people with albinism at the time.She eventually resettled in the relative peace of Kilimanjaro region, where a rights group for people with albinism, Under the Same Sun, built her a house and trained her to use a knitting machine. She now makes sweaters.Seventeen years on, the trauma has not faded.\"Even now, I sometimes dream of that night,\" Mariam says. \"When I wake up, I touch my arms and remember they are not there. It is something I will never escape.\"What happened to Miriam was one of scores of attacks targeting people with albinism and their body parts.Under The Same Sun says there have been 211 such incidents in Tanzania since 2008:79 people have been killed100 people were mutilated but survivedThree victims were not injuredTwo people were abducted and remain missing27 graves have been desecrated and body parts looted.In 2008 alone as many as 35 people with albinism were murdered, while many other deaths probably went unreported.Those killings drew global condemnation, prompting a government crackdown. The president at the time, Jakaya Kikwete, condemned the attacks and called for tough action against the killers.As a result, Tanzania stepped up investigations when it came to witchcraft-related  killings of people with albinism and tightened laws against discrimination.There have also been attempts to raise public awareness about the issue.At a traffic roundabout in the town of Sengerema  in the north-west, a monument has been built to commemorate the children, women and men with albinism who have lost their lives or were maimed in attacks.The life-size metal statue shows a father lifting a child with albinism onto his shoulders while the mother shields it from the sun.Mariam's name is carved in the monument.So is that of Mariamu Emmanuel, who was just five when she was killed in 2008.Sitting at his home in Mwanza, her brother, Manyashi Emmannuel, now 25, recalls that day. The pain still haunts him.\"I was eight years old, and saw her legs, hands and tongue removed by the attackers. Ever since then, I have been scared. It is most difficult at times when we hear of attacks close to elections.\"Despite the awareness campaigns, the attacks are still continuing.One has been recorded this year, in the north-western town of Simuyu, in June. The victim was unharmed but has now been moved to a safe house.President Samia Suluhu Hassan recently warned against what she called harmful traditional beliefs, saying they had no place in Tanzania's elections.Senyi Ngaga, a district commissioner of one of the areas prone to attacks, says government education campaigns have raised understanding, but rural areas remain vulnerable to superstitions as well as discrimination.She wants more involvement from everyone in the community to stop the attacks.\"We recently held a festival with traditional healers where we sat together and talked,\" the commissioner tells the BBC.\"As the election approaches, we also advised them to be good ambassadors to tell others to reject such acts and ensure that people with albinism are protected.\"A monument has been built to commemorate the people with albinism who've been attackedWhile campaign groups and survivors say much more work still needs to be done by the government, some progress has been made.Awareness drives, civil society programmes, and school inclusion initiatives have helped reduce attacks in some areas.Communities are slowly beginning to understand that people with albinism are not cursed and that superstitions can have deadly consequences.But the murder last year of two-year-old Asimwe Novath, abducted from her home in Kagera region, was a reminder that the issue has not gone away.Witnesses said the toddler was taken by force by two unidentified men while she played with her mother.Seventeen days later, parts of Asimwe's body were found in a sack, discarded under a bridge in the same region. Her remains were later buried at her family home.Nine suspects have been charged with premeditated murder in connection with the killing, but the case has not concluded.For Mariam, the case brought up troubling memories.\"It took me back to my own night of attack back in 2008. I know that pain, and I know her mother will never forget it.\"Her experience means that fear is part of her everyday life. She avoids crowds and rarely leaves home unaccompanied.As Wednesday's vote approaches, Mariam says she will not cast a ballot, sceptical about what difference it will make to her life.Instead, she will spend the day quietly at home in Kilimanjaro.You may also be interested in:'A bullet went through my skull': Tanzania abduction survivorSomalis with albinism: Pelted with stones and raw eggsMalawi albino attack survivor: 'I am too scared to sleep'PODCAST: Why are people with albinism still being attacked and mutilated?Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "5 hours agoNardine Saadin Los AngelesJames Devaney via Getty ImagesBritney Spears stared at herself in a mirror, grinning as she grabbed an electric clipper. Chunks of her long, iconic locks fell to the floor of the Southern California salon. Paparazzi cameras outside documented every second of the now-infamous night in 2007, later following her with her new buzzcut to get a tattoo.The star said she did it because she felt cornered and humiliated by the paparazzi, who had chased her from the house of her estranged husband, Kevin Federline. In the midst of an acrimonious and widely publicised custody battle for their two young boys, the Princess of Pop said she acted out in defiance and wanted to give the press \"some material\". She called it an impulsive decision - one that to her, served as a public rebuke to a world she felt held her to untenable standards.To her, it was a \"desperate move by a desperate person\".But to her estranged husband, it was a wake-up call to \"just how far things had spiralled out of control\".Bauer-Griffin via Getty ImagesDecades later, those moments and the others that went on to define the pop star and her very public unravelling are back in the limelight - but what exactly happened and why depends on who is doing the retelling. After Spears shared her outlook in her 2023 memoir, The Woman In Me, Federline is now speaking out and sharing his take on their years together in a book released this week, titled You Thought You Knew. Like Spears, Federline's book details their intimate and chaotic relationship, the mental anguish they both suffered and provides an inside glimpse at the conservatorship battle that dictated much of Spears' life and career. It provides a side-by-side look, a he-said, she-said dissection of their lives. Jason Merritt via Getty ImagesThe Grammy Award winner, 43, has already denounced her ex's memoir, writing on social media that Federline's revelations have been \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\".But the dancer-turned-reality TV star says he's releasing You Thought You Knew after years of hesitation because he does not want his children growing up \"feeling like they have to explain who their father is\".Federline responds to the stories and accusations that Spears tells in her 2023 tome, in which she describes being financially and emotionally controlled by those closest to her. He contradicts her account at times, levying fresh accusations. Despite both memoirs offering vastly different accounts at times, both have a similar aim in reframing the public narrative thrust upon them by illuminating the episodes that led to Spears' conservatorship battle, as well as the nationwide movement that freed the pop star in 2021.Getty ImagesBritney Spears' father, left, was appointed by a court to be in charge of her finances and career Did the conservatorship help or hurt?In her book, Spears condemned the court-ordered conservatorship, also known as a guardianship, which she was under from 2008-2021. During that time, her father, Jamie Spears, was in control of her finances, career and many aspects of her personal life.She says that if she was just left to live her life, she would have worked it out.\"Thirteen years went by with me feeling like a shadow of myself. I think back now on my father and his associates having control over my body and my money for that long and it makes me feel sick,\" she wrote.But, she added, she resolved to go along with the protracted arrangement \"for the sake of my sons,\" even though \"being in it was really hard\".After the conservatorship ended, her father Jamie Spears said it had been \"necessary\" to protect her, but it was time for her to have control back.In his recounting, Federline has a different take. Even when the marriage tanked, it wasn't easy for him to \"watch her spiral\", he writes. Federline supported the arrangement, arguing that it provided \"some semblance of normalcy\" for their two boys together. After her psychiatric hold, Federline says he immediately filed for sole custody, but that set into motion a slew of issues that exacerbated Spears' relationship with their children.His ex, he writes \"saw the events in her life through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one, the person wronged by everyone around her.\"But from where I stood, she needed help. Whether that was rehab or therapy, I couldn't say for sure,\" he writes, noting that she was in no state to manage her own affairs and needed some form of oversight or \"protective layer\".He adds that he came to find out that there was a lot he didn't know about the conservatorship, and he did not push for answers because part of him \"doesn't want to know\".Did the Free Britney movement get it 'wrong'?Spears has credited the viral Free Britney movement with helping her find the courage to challenge and eventually escape her conservatorship. \"The fact that my friends and my fans sensed what was happening and did all that for me, that's a debt I can never repay,\" she wrote, thanking them for standing up for her when she couldn't stand up for herself. But Federline says the movement \"got it wrong\" and those who are part of it now need to put the same effort into a \"Save Britney movement\". He shares ominous concerns about how the pop star is currently \"racing toward something irreversible\" and \"getting close to the 11th hour\".The pressure from the Free Britney movement, he alleges, led the judge on her conservatorship case \"to ignore the professional reports and cave to public opinion\".\"But none of that truly mattered in the end. If Britney believed she was being held against her will, and everything else she's shared since, then that trauma is real for her. And you can't ignore that,\" he says.Spears has continued to make headlines with strange and sometimes concerning posts on Instagram. Their boys are grown up but, according to Federline, they have haven't seen their mother much, and they don't really want to. Federline has four additional children, along with the two with Spears. Federline says he has lost faith that things will ever fully turn around for his ex-wife.\"I still hope that Britney can find peace. Whatever her future holds, I hope it's one where she can finally take control of her own life, on her own terms. This whole saga, twenty years of it, was built on denial. Britney never reached the first step of recovery: admitting there was a problem.\"AFPSpears has said she felt constantly cornered by paparazzi cameras that followed and dissected her lifeA ghost in their marriageSpears has laid blame on many people who were once close to her, including two of her exes, Federline and former NSYNC frontman Justin Timberlake.She accuses both of ruining her ability to \"trust people again\".In his own memoir, Federline says he was making a career for himself as a professional dancer who worked with Michael Jackson and NSYNC when he crossed paths with Spears. The couple had met before, when Federline was dancing on a tour for Spears' opening act.Federline, for his part, is self-aware, writing that he knows people viewed the Fresno, California, native as \"this dude jumped out of his trailer and into Britney's mansion\". But even the day before their wedding, there was a shadow over the relationship, he says.Federline contends in his book that when he and Spears got together in their early 20s, she had never really moved on from her ex-boyfriend Timberlake, detailing that they had a lot of \"unfinished business\" and that \"it lingered, like a ghost in the background of our relationship\". In her memoir, Spears recounted the pitfalls of her relationship with Timberlake, including him asking her to have an abortion and the public embarrassment that befell her after he accused her of cheating - further heightened when he cast a Spears lookalike in his music video for Cry Me a River.Frank Trapper via Getty ImagesBritney Spears and Justin Timberlake were the globe's most famous celebrity couple.Their relationship, which lasted from 1999 to 2002, has also been dissected over the years and has come with a public apology from Timberlake, after several documentaries about Spears recast her as a victim in her conservatorship.Federline says that \"there was always something there with Justin that she couldn't let go of\". He says Spears even called Timberlake the night before their wedding to get closure.\"Now, looking back... I realise it was deeper than that. She never really got over him,\" he writes.Re-igniting an old feud and an army of fans Federline's memoir has raised the ire of Spears, and her vocal army of online supporters. James Miller, an activist and Free Britney proponent, says the book will not help the singer.\"Britney does struggle with mental health problems, that's pretty obvious,\" he told the BBC. \"Exploiting her right now really isn't the best time. I don't think there's any alarm to sound.\"Michael Buckner via Getty ImagesFans protested outside the courthouse as Spears fought to be freed from her conservatorship From breaking out on The Mickey Mouse Club as a child star to dancing with a snake around her shoulders at the MTV Music Video Awards, Spears has lived her whole adult life in the spotlight.S Mark Young, a professor at the University of Southern California and author of The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism is Seducing America, says Federline's book is unlikely to change people's minds about her.\"I think after this coming week, the book will die. Most people who follow Britney will not be moved,\" he says.Some have wondered why Federline, 47, has chosen to speak out now. \"No one heals when a book like this is written,\" Mr Young says.Mr Miller, and many online, have noted that now that their sons are both over 18, Federline would no longer be receiving a $40,000-per-month payment from the singer to support them.Federline denies having an ulterior motive beyond wanting to finally share his side of this infamous saga.Getty ImagesFederline says he worked hard to not just live off of Spears' money, such as DJing in Vegas in 2018In the memoir, Federline says the book was his best chance at sharing his side of the story.For decades, the media, Spears and her family have mostly told Federline's story, largely leaning into his \"bad boy\" persona and making him the butt of many late-night jokes.\"This is about finally telling my story,\" he writes in his book. \"My version. In my words. Because everybody else has done it for me. The media. The blogs. The exes. The strangers. The jokes. The headlines. They all had something to say about me. And I stayed quiet.\"He denies that he ever \"was just coasting off her money\" and insists he has always been \"out there hustling, grinding, investing - working to build a solid foundation for myself and my kids\".This opportunity was a way for him to finally share his side after decades of stories, gossip, rumours and accusations - which he says he avoided responding to in hopes of giving his family and children \"some kind of normal life\". \"But silence didn't bring peace,\" he writes. \"It left me choking on the words I never said.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoJamie WhiteheadBBCA number of people are feared to have been killed and injured in Nigeria after an explosion in a mosque in Borno state. Eyewitnesses said the blast in the Gamboru market of Maiduguri, the state capital, happened during evening prayers. One report suggests seven people were killed, but there has been no official confirmation of any casualties. Unverified footage on social media appears to show the aftermath of the explosion, with people stood in a market area with dust particles in the air. No group has admitted carrying out the attack, but militants have previously targeted mosques and crowded places in the area with suicide and improvised explosive device (IED) attacks.Maiduguri has been central to an insurgency by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province. Military operations by Boko Haram to create an Islamic caliphate in Borno state began in 2009. Security measures against the group have failed to prevent sporadic attacks against civilians in north-east Nigeria. ",

    "body": "The Libyan army chief has been killed in an air crash in Turkey, Libya's prime minister has said.Gen Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad was on board a Falcon 50 aircraft flying out of the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Tuesday evening. He was killed along with four other military officials and three crew members.Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said signal with the business jet was lost at 20:52 local time (17:52 GMT) - about 42 minutes after it took off from Ankara's airport. The Tripoli-bound jet had issued an emergency landing request before contact was lost. The aircraft's wreckage was later found south-west of Ankara, and its voice recorder and black box had been recovered.The emergency services are still trying to retrieve the bodies. An investigation is under way into what caused the crash.In a post on X, Yerlikaya wrote that police had spotted the debris near the village of Kesikkavak, in the Haymana district.In Libya, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, the prime minister of the country's internationally-recognised Government of National Unity (GNU), said he had received news of the deaths of Gen Haddad and other senior Libyan military officials on board the jet.The prime minister called it a \"great loss\" for the nation, saying Libya had \"lost men who served their country with sincerity and dedication\".Gen Haddad and his team had been in Turkey for talks aimed at further strengthening military and security co-operation between the two countries.Turkey has played an increasingly dominant role in Libya after intervening in 2019 to prevent an army from the east of the country driving out the internationally-recognised government in Tripoli, and has built close political, military and economic ties.Libya's rival Government of National Stability (GNS) in the east of the country is run by military strongman Khalifa Haftar. The north African has been battered by many armed groups who emerged after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.A series of armed uprisings that led to the long-time dictator's killing created a security vacuum, with much of the country lawless and chaotic since.Additional reporting  by Farouk Chothia",

    "body": "19 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinandJames FitzGeraldTwo people have died and 20 others have been injured after two explosions and fire at a Pennsylvania nursing home caused a partial collapse of the building.Emergency crews were called to the Silver Lake Nursing Home in Bristol at about 14:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Tuesday after receiving reports an initial explosion and an odour of gas, said fire chief Kevin Dippolito.Crews evacuated people from the building, and just \"15 to 30 seconds\" after they left, there came a second explosion and a fire, Mr Dippolito added.Authorities have suggested the cause could have been a gas leak, though their investigation is ongoing.In a statement to US media, local gas firm PECO said the explosion occurred while its crews responded to reports of a gas smell. PECO said it was not yet known whether its gas or equipment was involved.Images and videos posted on social platforms by local media outlets show a partially collapsed building with massive flames billowing out of it.Recalling the effort to rescue people from the building after the first blast, Mr Dippolito told reporters that \"there was one police officer who literally threw two people over his shoulders and ran\" with them towards medical staff.Several people were trapped in the basement of the collapsed building but were rescued, Mr Dippolito also said.Five people whose whereabouts were initially unknown were later accounted for, said Charles Winik, the police chief.Debris was reportedly found scattered in the surrounding area. A man who lived a block away described hearing a \"loud ka-boom\" as he watched television. \"I thought an airplane or something came and fell on my house,\" Willie Tye told the AP news agency, adding that he then saw \"fire everywhere\".Relatives of those living at the nursing home described their concern as they awaited news.Cathleen O'Donnell told the New York Times she was \"sick with worry\" as she tried to get updates on her sister, Sandra Hart.On discovering that Ms Hart was alive, Ms O'Donnell said she was \"completely ecstatic and over the moon\", though told the paper she was still waiting to hear about her sister's condition.State Governor Josh Shapiro praised the response from authorities around the region, and said that the residents living near the nursing home were \"outstanding\". \"We had residents coming out of their houses offering to help us,\" he said. \"This is the Pennsylvania way: neighbours helping neighbours in a moment of need.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoGabriela PomeroyandAnastasiia Levchenko,Kyiv Three people - including two police officers - have been killed in an explosion in Moscow, Russian authorities have said. Two traffic police officers saw a \"suspicious individual\" near a police car on the city's Yeletskaya Street, and when they approached the suspect to detain him, an explosive device was detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee has said. Reports in Russia say the third person killed was the suspect, but this has not been officially confirmed. The blast took place close to the location where a senior Russian general was killed in a car bombing in the capital on Monday. Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died after an explosive device - which had been planted under a car - was detonated.Investigate Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement on Telegram that a criminal case was being investigated in Moscow \"regarding an attempt on the lives of traffic police officers\". The officers have been named by Russian media as Ilya Klimanov, 24, and Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Sources in Ukraine's military intelligence agency, HUR, told the BBC that a local resident, eliminated two representatives of the Russian law enforcement agency, \"as a sign of disagreement with the Kremlin's aggressive policy\" and said that a man \"threw an explosive package through the car window, causing an explosion\".According to the HUR sources, two other people were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Ukrainian military sources also told the BBC on Wednesday that the two officers killed had \"participated in hostilities against Ukraine,\" and added there was \"evidence of their involvement in the torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war\".There are no details and Moscow has not commented. Speaking to Reuters news agency, Alexander, a resident who lives close by, said: \"There was an explosion.\"It was loud bang - like with the car a few days ago.\"Russia said it suspected Ukraine was behind Monday's explosion, without providing any evidence. However Ukraine has not said whether it was involved in Fanil Sarvarov's death.It is also not known whether the two explosions are linked. Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department.He was the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.",

    "body": "Algeria's parliament has unanimously passed a law declaring France's colonisation of the North African state a crime, and demanding an apology and reparations. The law also criminalises the glorification of colonialism, state-run TV reports.The vote is the latest sign of increasingly strained diplomatic relations between the two countries, with some observers saying they are at their lowest since Algeria gained independence 63 years ago.France's colonialisation of Algeria between 1830 and 1962 was marked by mass killings, large-scale deportations and ended in a bloody war of independence. Algeria says the war killed 1.5 million people, while French historians put the death toll much lower.France's President Emmanuel Macron has previously acknowledged the colonisation of Algeria was a \"crime against humanity\" but has not offered an apology.Lawmakers wore scarves in the colours of the national flag and chanted \"long live Algeria\" as they applauded the bill's passage through parliament, AFP news agency reports.It says the legislation states that France has \"legal responsibility\" for the \"tragedies it caused\", and \"full and fair\" compensation was an \"inalienable right of the Algerian state and people\". France has not yet commented on the vote. It comes at a time of growing pressure on Western powers to offer reparations for slavery and colonialism, and to return looted artefacts still kept in their museums.Algerian lawmakers have been demanding that France return a 16th Century bronze canon, known as Baba Merzoug, meaning \"Blessed Father\", that was regarded as the protector of Algiers, now Algeria's capital.French forces captured the city in 1830, on their third attempt, and removed the cannon - which is now in the port city of Brest in north-western France.In 2020, France returned the remains of 24 Algerian fighters who were killed resisting French colonial forces in the 19th Century.Last month, Algeria hosted a conference of African states to push for justice and reparations.Algeria's Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said that a legal framework would ensure that restitution was neither regarded as \"a gift nor a favour\".Diplomatic relations between between Algeria and France soured last year, when Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal was then arrested at Algiers airport in  and jailed for five years, before being pardoned by Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune last month.Prosecutors said he had undermined national security for making remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterDemocratic US Representative Joyce Beatty has filed a lawsuit seeking to remove President Donald Trump's name from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was illegal because changing the name requires \"an act of Congress\". The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. Beatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a \"living memorial\" to former President Kennedy. \"[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump,\" the lawsuit states.In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had \"stepped up\" and saved the Kennedy Center \"by strengthening its finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke programming\". \"As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America's most iconic cultural institutions,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. On Friday, the president's name was added to the exterior of the building, and the centre's website logo now reads \"The Trump Kennedy Center\".The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for Kennedy.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesConstruction began on a performing arts centre in the 1950s and after Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to name it after him.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired a slew of the centre's board members and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make him chairman of the board. His close adviser Richard Grenell became board president.The centre's board of trustees currently has 34 members appointed by Trump and 23 others designated as members by US law, according to the centre's website. Trump also secured about $257m (£190m) in congressional funding to pay for major renovations and other costs at the venue, saying it was in \"bad shape\". Several members of the Kennedy family took to social media to criticise the name change. Joe Kennedy III, a former House member and grandnephew of the late president, said that \"the Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".\"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he added.",

    "body": "US authorities have discovered more than a million more documents potentially related to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein that they plan to release in the coming days and weeks, officials say. The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice (DoJ) about the discovery and turned over the documents for lawyers to review.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,\" the DoJ said on social media on Wednesday. The department said that given the volume of material, the process could take \"a few more weeks\".The agency said it would \"continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump's direction to release the files\". The statement did not specify how the FBI and New York prosecutors came across the additional material. The news comes after the justice department released thousands of documents last week - some heavily redacted - related to their investigations into Epstein. The files were released after Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act - signed into law by US President Donald Trump - that ordered the agency to share all the documents with the public while protecting victims’ identities. Many of the documents released last week had names and other information blacked out, including names of people the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case.The justice department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the  aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations. The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".Included in the first release of documents were emails appearing to be exchanged between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein.The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the justice department.This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "11 hours agoVitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russia editorFrancisco Richart/SOPA Images/LightRocketUkraine's police evacuation group White Angels evacuates civilians from the village of Krasnopillya in Sumy regionFifty-two residents of a Ukrainian village have been taken to Russia by invading forces in a cross-border raid on the village of Hrabovske, authorities in Kyiv say. Thirteen Ukrainian soldiers were also captured in the border village in the northeastern Sumy region.The attack occurred at night on Saturday, when about 100 Russian troops attacked the village, said Viktor Trehubov, a spokesman for Ukraine's military Joint Forces Task Force. The civilians were first rounded up in a church and then taken across the border to Russia, he told the BBC.It was unusual for invading forces to take civilians to Russia before establishing a firm presence in occupied territory, he added.Russia has so far not commented on the fate of civilians from Hrabovske, but reports from Ukraine indicate they may have been taken to Belgorod, a major regional centre about 50 miles (80 km) inside Russia.\"My friends' mother has been taken there. There is no way of contacting her even though they tried,\" said Volodymyr Bitsak, a member of the Sumy regional council. \"As far as I know, they've been taken to the city of Belgorod and are being held at an unknown location.\"Lt-Col Trehubov told the BBC on Tuesday evening that fighting was still ongoing in the southern part of Hrabovske, but Deep State, a Ukrainian website monitoring the battlefield situation, said later that the village had been captured by Russian forces.The defence ministry in Moscow said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces had been \"hit\" at Hrabovske and several other villages in Sumy region.Meanwhile, in the eastern region of Donetsk, the Ukrainian military said it had withdrawn troops from the embattled town of Siversk \"to preserve the lives of our soldiers\".Russia's capture of the town brings its forces closer to the Donetsk \"fortress belt cities\" of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, about 35km (21 miles) to the west.Ukrainian authorities have been working to move civilians away from parts of the Sumy region bordering Russia. But Viktor Babych, a deputy head of the Sumy regional administration, says 56% of residents in border areas are refusing to be leave, and 32,000 civilians including 604 children remain there.Most of the 52 civilians captured in the cross-border raid on Hrabovske were elderly people who had refused official evacuation orders.\"It was a smash and grab,\" said Lt-Col Trehubov. \"They quickly rounded everyone up and quickly removed them. This had never happened before. We had never had such raids before.\"However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said children had been captured too.\"I'm surprised there were children. I'm simply surprised that parents treated their children like that,\" Zelensky told reporters. \"I think they simply did not expect to be taken [to Russia] by Russian military.\"The vast majority of civilians had already been evacuated from the village, whose pre-war population is reported to be about 700 people.Ukraine's ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets says the civilians \"were held incommunicado and in improper conditions\" by Russian troops invading Hrabovske before being taken out of Ukraine.\"Such actions are a serious violation of international humanitarian law. They violate the laws and customs of war by unlawfully detaining and forcefully deporting civilians,\" he says.",

    "body": "Two British campaigners are among five people denied US visas after the State Department accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" American tech platforms into suppressing free speech.Imran Ahmed, an ex-Labour adviser who now heads the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), and Clare Melford, CEO of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), were labelled \"radical activists\" by the Trump administration and banned from entering the US.A French ex-EU commissioner and two senior figures at a Germany-based anti-online hate group were also denied visas.European leaders have condemned the measures, while the UK government said it is \"fully committed\" to upholding free speech.\"While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content,\" a UK government spokesperson said.French President Emmanuel Macron described the travel ban as \"intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty\" while the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"unacceptable and an attempt to challenge our sovereignty\".The US billed the measures as a response to people and organisations that have campaigned for restrictions on American tech firms, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying they belonged to a \"global censorship-industrial complex\".He said: \"President Trump has been clear that his America First foreign policy rejects violations of American sovereignty. Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception.\"Ahmed from the CCDH, which says it advocates for government action against hate speech and disinformation online, has links to senior Labour figures. He was previously an aide to Labour minister Hilary Benn, and Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has served as a director of the group he founded.The US government labelled Ahmed a \"collaborator\" for the CCDH's purported past work with the Biden administration. BBC News has contacted the CCDH for comment.Melford founded the GDI, a non-profit that monitors the spread of disinformation, in 2018.US Undersecretary of State Sarah B Rogers accused the GDI of using US taxpayer money \"to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press\". A GDI spokesperson told the BBC that \"the visa sanctions announced today are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\".\"The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\"Also targeted was Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, who suggested that a \"witch hunt\" was taking place.Breton was described by the State Department as the \"mastermind\" of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation on social media firms. However, it has angered some US conservatives who see it as seeking to censor right-wing opinions. Brussels denies this.Breton has clashed with Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of X, over obligations to follow EU rules.The European Commission recently fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges - the first fine under the DSA. It said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".In response, Musk's site blocked the Commission from sharing adverts on its platform.Reacting to the visa ban, Breton posted on X: \"To our American friends: Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"Also subject to bans were Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organisation that the State Department said helped enforce the DSA.In a statement to the BBC, the two CEOs called it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary\". They added: \"We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorGetty ImagesZelensky said the 20 points agreed with the Americans offered Ukraine security guarantees that mirrored Nato membershipUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has given details of an updated peace plan offering Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarised zone in their place.Detailing the 20-point plan agreed by US and Ukrainian envoys in Florida at the weekend, Zelensky said the Russians would respond on Wednesday once the Americans had spoken to them.Describing the plan as \"the main framework for ending the war\", he said it proposed security guarantees from the US, Nato and Europeans for a co-ordinated military response if Russia invaded Ukraine again.On the key question of Ukraine's eastern Donbas, Zelensky said a \"free economic zone\" was a potential option.He told journalists that as Ukraine was against withdrawal, US negotiators were looking to establish a demilitarised zone or a free economic zone. Any area that Ukrainian troops pulled out of would have to be policed by Ukraine, he stressed. \"There are two options,\" Zelensky said, \"either the war continues, or something will have to be decided regarding all potential economic zones.\"The 20-point plan is seen as an update of an original 28-point document, agreed by US envoy Steve Witkoff with the Russians several weeks ago, which was widely seen as heavily geared towards the Kremlin's demands.The Russians have insisted that Ukraine pulls out of almost a quarter of its own territory in the eastern Donetsk region in return for a peace deal. The rest is already under Russian occupation.Sensitive issues including questions over territory would have to be resolved \"at the leaders' level\", but the new draft would provide Ukraine with strong security guarantees and a military strength of 800,000, Zelensky explained.Much of the updated plan resembles what came out of recent talks in Berlin involving US negotiators Witkoff and Jared Kushner with Ukrainian and European leaders. The setting then moved to Miami last weekend where US President Donald Trump's team spoke separately to Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and then Ukrainian and European officials.There now appears to be far more detail on the territorial issue, although it is clear the Ukrainian side was unable to reach a consensus with the Americans.Zelensky explained that if Ukraine was prepared to pull its heavy forces back by five, 10 or 40km in the 25% of Donetsk it still held to create an economic zone, making it virtually demilitarised, then Russia would have to do the same \"accordingly by five, 10, or 40km\".Russian troops are currently about 40km (25 miles) east of Ukraine's \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, having captured the town of Siversk.Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to be impressed by the kind of compromise being proposed for Donetsk. He said this month that Russia would take control of the entire east of Ukraine by force if Ukrainian troops did not pull out.However, Trump is pushing for a deal to end almost four years of full-scale war and the Ukrainian president believes Russia cannot afford to reject the US plan.\"They cannot tell President Trump, 'look we're against a peaceful settlement',\" Zelensky told reporters. \"If they try to obstruct everything, then President Trump would have to arm us heavily, while imposing all possible sanctions against them.\"Zelensky made clear that if a free economic zone were established in Donetsk it would have to be under Ukrainian administration and police - \"definitely not the so-called Russian police\". The current front line would then become the boundary of the economic zone with international forces on the ground along the contact line to ensure no Russian infiltration.Russia has so far rejected a European proposal to police any peace deal through a Coalition of the Willing as a \"brazen threat\".A referendum would need to be held on the whole peace plan, Zelensky said, and only a referendum could decide on the idea of a potential free economic zone in Donbas.He emphasised that an economic zone would also have to be set up around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant currently occupied by Russia, and that Russian troops would have to pull out of four other Ukrainian regions - Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv.The current US proposal for the nuclear plant would be for Ukraine, the US and Russia to operate it jointly, but Kyiv disagreed with that, Zelensky said.The main points of the plan reaffirm Ukraine's sovereignty and propose a non-aggression pact between Russia and its neighbour with a monitoring mechanism.As well as strong security guarantees mirroring Nato's Article Five, which requires members to aid an ally under attack, Ukraine is to be allowed a maximum military strength of 800,000 in peacetime.Discussions are still going on over a US plan to receive compensation in return for security guarantees, so Zelensky says it is not currently part of the document.There is no reference barring Ukraine from joining Nato, which was in the original 28-point plan and something Russia has consistently demanded.And the latest framework proposes that Ukraine joins the European Union with a defined date of accession. It is currently a candidate, but a number of other candidate countries are seen as first in line, such as Albania.There are plans for a Ukraine investment fund of about $200bn (£150bn) involving both the US and Europe.Among the other points is a requirement for Ukraine to hold elections as soon as possible after the deal is signed. Russia and the US have both pushed for a vote, even though Ukraine is under martial law because of the full-scale invasion. ",

    "body": "Venezuela has accused the United States of the \"greatest extortion\" at an emergency session of the UN Security Council in New York.  Washington's seizure of two Venezuelan oil tankers was \"worse than piracy,\" the Venezuelan ambassador to the UN said. The emergency meeting of the Security Council was called to discuss the seizure of the tankers, which took place off the coast of Venezuela earlier this month. The US has also said it was pursuing a third Venezuelan oil tanker. President Trump has accused Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drugs cartel and said gangs had operated with impunity for too long.On 16 December, Trump ordered a naval blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. The US president has said the US will keep or sell the crude oil it has taken, as well as the vessels themselves.The US has been building up its military presence in the Pacific and Caribbean Seas in recent months, sending 15,000 troops and a range of aircraft carriers and warships to the area. It is the largest deployment to the region since the US invaded Panama in 1989, and the stated aim is to stop the flow of fentanyl and cocaine to the US.The US has carried out strikes on what it says are Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, targeting more than 20 vessels and killing at least 100 people. Some experts say the strikes could violate laws governing armed conflict.Venezuela's envoy to the UN said the US was subjecting his country to the \"greatest extortion\" in its history. Speaking at the UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday, Samuel Moncada said \"we are in the presence of a power that acts outside of international law, demanding that Venezuelans vacate our country and hand it over.\"Regarding the US seizure of Venezuelan oil, he added: \"We are talking about pillaging, looting and recolonisation of Venezuela. \"The government of the United States does not have jurisdiction in the Caribbean.\"Referring to the Venezuelan oil industry, he said: \"What does that have to do with drugs?\"In response, the US Ambassador to the UN, Michael Waltz, told the Security Council the US does not recognise Mr Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.\"Maduro's ability to sell Venezuela's oil enables his fraudulent claims to power and his narco-terrorist activities,\" Mr Waltz said. On a visit to a trade fair in Caracas, President Maduro said \"the Security Council is giving overwhelming support to Venezuela.\"Russia and China accused the US of bullying and aggression.The US was \"illegally destroying\" civilian vessels in the Caribbean Sea, the Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the UN meeting. He warned that other countries could be next. The US actions against Venezuelan vessels, he said, were \"a template for future acts of force against Latin American states.\"Meanwhile, China's envoy to the UN, Sun Lei, called on the US to \"immediately halt relevant actions and avoid further escalation of tensions.\"",

    "body": "20 hours agoLebo DisekoGlobal Religion correspondent Getty ImagesPope Leo has criticised the Trump administration's immigration policyJesse Romero, a conservative Catholic podcaster, has some choice words for Pope Leo XIV.\"The Pope should tell us how to get to heaven,\" says Romero. \"He has no authority over the government; he has to stay in his lane.\"As a Donald Trump supporter, he is angry about criticism made by the American-born Pope and US bishops about his mass deportation policy. With one in five Americans identifying as Catholic, the Church plays an important role in American life - and politics.Catholics like Vice President JD Vance, and influential legal activist Leonard Leo, were an important part of Donald Trump's electoral success. They are at the heart of the cabinet too, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon holding key offices.But the issue of immigration has become a faultline between Church leadership and the government, as well as amongst parishioners themselves.When cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in May, Romero had hoped for a \"Trump-like Pope,\" with a similar outlook to the president.Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years. It was backed by the Pope, who called the statement \"very important\" and urged all Catholics and \"people of goodwill, to listen carefully\" to it.Getty ImagesChicago has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcementPicking a fight with the Pope\"I think the relationship is quite tense,\" says David Gibson, director of Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture.Conservatives had hoped that Pope Leo would bring a change from his predecessor Pope Francis's focus on issues of social justice and migration, according to Gibson. \"Many of them are angry. They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute. That figure is around 30% for Hispanics, who are 37% of the US Catholic population.Getty ImagesUS Vice President JD Vance has been vocal about how his Catholic faith has influenced his politicsThe growing power and prominence of right-wing Catholics in the political sphere is exemplified by JD Vance, a convert to the religion who says his politics are shaped by his faith. Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The goal, she says, \"was to bring Communion to people inside, to minister to them, which is something that used to be allowed and is not being allowed\".The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry.\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee. St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"Getty ImagesClergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility'Inconsistent with the Gospel'Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. Just five bishops voted against it and three abstained.\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.\"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\"He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching.\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism - which summarises the teachings of the Church - is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect. Everybody else, we've got to pray for each other.\"",

    "body": "21 hours agoAnbarasan EthirajanGlobal affairs correspondent NurPhoto via Getty ImagesProtests erupted in India over the killing of a Hindu garment worker in BangladeshThe killing of a Hindu man during recent violent protests in Bangladesh has pushed already strained ties between Dhaka and Delhi into a deeper crisis. As the two neighbours accuse each other of destabilising relations, questions are growing over whether their once close, time-tested relationship is fraying beyond repair.In India, the episode has sparked protests by Hindu nationalist groups. The man who was killed - Dipu Chandra Das, 27 - a member of Bangladesh's Hindu minority, was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob last week in Mymensingh, in northern Bangladesh.The incident happened hours before violent protests broke out over the murder of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent student leader, in the capital, Dhaka.Hadi's supporters alleged that the main suspect, who they say is linked to the Awami League - the party of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina - had fled to India, further fuelling anti-India sentiment in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Bangladeshi police, however, said there was no confirmation that the suspect had left the country.Hasina's conviction is testing India-Bangladesh tiesIn recent days, the South Asian neighbours have suspended visa services in several cities, including Delhi, and accused each other of failing to ensure adequate security for their diplomatic missions.The two countries have also summoned each other's high commissioners to raise their security concerns.\"I sincerely hope tensions don't escalate further on both sides,\" Riva Ganguly Das, a former Indian high commissioner to Dhaka, told the BBC, adding that the \"volatile situation\" in Bangladesh made it difficult to predict which way things would go.Getty ImagesGraffiti in Dhaka, painted in memory of Sharif Osman Hadi who died of gunshot injuriesAnti-India sentiment in Bangladesh is not new.A section of Bangladeshis has always resented what they see as India's overbearing influence on their country, especially during Hasina's 15-year rule before she was deposed in an uprising last year.The anger has grown since Hasina took refuge in India and Delhi, so far, hasn't agreed to send her back despite several requests from Dhaka.In the aftermath of Hadi's killing, some young leaders are reported to have made provocative anti-India statements.In recent weeks, Bangladeshi security forces had to stop protesters from marching toward the Indian high commission in Dhaka.Last week, a mob pelted the Indian assistant high commission building in Chittagong with stones, prompting outrage from Delhi. Police later detained 12 people in connection with the incident, but they were released later without any charge.There were counter rallies in India. Bangladesh strongly objected to a protest by a Hindu group outside its diplomatic premises in Delhi, calling it \"unjustifiable\".\"I have not seen this kind of suspicion and mistrust between the two sides before,\" Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, said.He added that both sides should protect each other's diplomatic missions according to established norms.AFP via Getty ImagesA silent protest in Bangladesh to condemn the killing of Dipu Chandra DasSome readers may find the details below disturbing.The brutal lynching of Das, a garment factory worker, has only added to the anger on the Indian side.He was accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad and was lynched by a mob, who then tied his body to a tree and set it on fire.Videos of the killing were widely shared on social media, triggering outrage on both sides of the border.Bangladesh's interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, said there was \"no place for such violence in the new Bangladesh\", promising that no one involved in the killing would be spared.Bangladeshi police say they have arrested 12 people in connection with the killing of Das.Analysts say his killing has once again raised questions over the safety of minorities and civil society activists in Bangladesh, with religious fundamentalists becoming more assertive and intolerant after Hasina's exit.Radical Islamists have desecrated hundreds of Sufi shrines, attacked Hindus, prevented women from playing football in some areas and have also curtailed music and cultural shows.Human rights groups have also expressed increasing concerns over rising mob violence in Bangladesh in the past year.\"Hardline elements of society now see themselves as the mainstream, and they don't want to see pluralism or diversity of thought in the country,\" Asif Bin Ali, a Bangladeshi political analyst, said.\"These radical elements are dehumanising people and institutions by setting a narrative that they are pro-India. That gives a green light to others on the ground to attack them.\"Many in Bangladesh suspect Islamist radicals to be part of the mob that vandalised and set fire to the buildings of two Bangladesh dailies - The Daily Star and Prothom Alo - and a cultural institution last week, accusing them of being pro-India. Civil society activists in Bangladesh have criticised the interim administration for failing to stop the recent violence. Even before the protests, the interim government was under scrutiny as it struggled to maintain law and order and deliver results amid the political turmoil.Experts like Ashok Swain argue that right-wing leaders on both sides are making provocative statements for their own benefit, inflaming tension and public anger.\"A large section of the Indian media is also playing up events in Bangladesh and portraying that the country is descending into communal chaos,\" says Mr Swain, a professor of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden.\"People should realise that stability in Bangladesh is key to India's security, particularly in the north-east,\" he says.With the interim administration in Dhaka facing criticism over its lack of control and legitimacy, there is broad consensus that an elected government would be better positioned to address Bangladesh's domestic and foreign challenges.The country is scheduled to hold elections on 12 February but until then, Yunus has the difficult task of avoiding further violence.Getty ImagesPolice blocked a protest march to the Indian high commission in Dhaka last weekWith Ms Hasina's Awami League banned from taking part in the polls, it's widely expected that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) will emerge as the winner.But Islamist political parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami can pose a challenge to the BNP.There are worries that there could be more violence in the coming days as hardline religious parties exploit anti-India sentiments.\"The biggest victim of this anti-India politics is not India, it's Bangladeshi citizens themselves – like secular minded individuals, centrists and minorities,\" warns Asif Bin Ali.He says the current narrative shows that anyone or any institution who criticises fundamentalists can be \"dehumanised by labelling them pro-India, and attacks on them can be justified\".Policy makers in India are aware of the changing dynamics in Bangladesh.An Indian parliamentary panel said developments in Bangladesh pose \"the greatest strategic challenge\" to Delhi since the country's independence war in 1971.Former Bangladeshi diplomats like Humayun Kabir feel that India should accept the ground reality and reach out to Bangladesh to rebuild trust. \"We are neighbours and inter-dependent,\" Mr Kabir says.Delhi has already indicated that it will engage with an elected government in Bangladesh and that could pave the way for a diplomatic reboot.Until then, experts on both sides caution that anger on the street must not be allowed to further strain bilateral ties.",

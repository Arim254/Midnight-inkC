    "body": "4 hours agoIan AikmanEPAAntónio José Seguro is set to defeat far-right populist André Ventura in a landslide victoryCentre-left candidate António José Seguro is poised to comfortably beat his far-right rival to the Portuguese presidency after a run-off vote. With 95% of votes counted, Seguro has won 66%, with the leader of the far-right Chega (Enough) party, André Ventura, trailing behind on 34%.The two men went head-to-head in a campaign at times overshadowed by the deadly storms that has lashed the country in recent days.Seguro, 63, had been backed by politicians on both sides of the aisle, with several conservative figures voicing support for the moderate socialist to see off his far-right opponent.Thousands of self-declared \"non-socialists\" had signed an open letter backing Seguro for president, including former conservative ministers. The former Socialist Party leader is now set to succeed the conservative Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as president.The role of president in Portugal is largely ceremonial, but it comes with some key powers – including the so-called \"atomic bomb\" ability to dissolve parliament and call snap elections in certain circumstances – as well as the power to veto legislation, though this can be overturned.Despite his loss on Sunday, Ventura's position in second place reflects the rapid ascent of his party, which became the second largest in Portugal's parliament last year – just six years after Chega was formed in 2019.Portugal's centre-right Prime Minister Luís Montenegro has previously denounced Ventura – a 43-year-old former football pundit – as \"xenophobic, racist and demagogic\". But the prime minister chose not to support Seguro's run for president, instead declining to endorse either candidate.",

    "body": "12 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongEPA/ShutterstockSaturday's clashes came a week after more than 100 police officers were injured in another protestSix people have been arrested after police clashed with protesters in Milan, one of the host cities of the Winter Olympic Games, during the first day of the competition. Thousands took to the streets in the northern Italian city on Saturday to protest against the Games and a range of issues including the cost of living. Some released fireworks and threw stones at police, who responded with water cannon. It comes after the government tightened protest laws in the wake of a demonstration last weekend in Turin that left more than 100 officers injured, according to government figures. Meanwhile, officials are investigating suspected sabotage on northern Italy's railway network on Saturday. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said those protesting against the Olympics were the \"enemy of Italy\" and had put images of the demonstrations \"on the televisions of half the world\", while thousands of other Italians were working hard to make the competition a success.She said this had happened \"after others locked railway cables to prevent trains from starting\". Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini described those involved in confrontations in Milan as \"criminals\". \"Just days after the shameful violence in Turin, more clashes, more attacks on law enforcement,\" he said. \"We're proud to have pushed for a new security package that will allow for even more effective interventions against thugs and criminals.\"The Turin demonstration, which was called in response to the eviction of an unofficial social centre, started peacefully but later turned violent when armed groups confronted police. More than 30 people were arrested. One officer was attacked with a hammer, which Meloni described as attempted murder. A new security package, which was adopted on Thursday after being fast-tracked as a result of the violence in Turin, allows police to detain suspected troublemakers for up to 12 hours before demonstrations to stop them from spreading unrest. Critics have called it repressive. Most of those involved in Saturday's protest in Milan marched peacefully. One woman, Francesca Missana, told news agency AFP that the Olympic Games were \"no longer sustainable from an environmental or a social point of view, their time is up\".\"These Games were promoted as sustainable and cost-neutral,\" protest organiser Alberto di Monte told AFP. He added that because the Games were spread across multiple sites, and that billions had been spent on roads instead of protecting the mountains.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesSevered cables were discovered near Bologna, which has a major transport hubSaturday also saw chaos on some of Italy's northern rail networks, with suspected attacks delaying people for hours. A fire hit rail infrastructure between Bologna and Venice, and police later found severed cables and an explosive device in locations nearby.Police said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro on the Adriatic coast and electric cables were found severed near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track.Bologna's central rail station is a major hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines.RFI, which owns the country's railways, said services have since returned to normal. \"These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling,\" Salvini, who is also Italy's transport minister, said on Saturday.The Winter Olympics are taking place until 22 February in a number of locations, from Milan to the resort town of Cortina d'Ampezzo, the Dolomite regions of Predazzo and Tesero, and the Alpine resorts of Livigno and Bormio.",

    "body": "8 hours agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesTwo identical twins on trial for murder in France have confounded attempts to determine which one pulled the trigger because they have the same DNA, French media report.The 33-year-old brothers are among five defendants on trial near Paris, accused of a double murder and several subsequent attempted killings in 2020, according to reputable French newspaper Le Parisien.It reports that both are suspected of conspiring to plot the double murder, but that DNA on an assault rifle used in one of the later gun battles could only be from one twin.A police officer told the court that forensic experts were unable to tell which of the brothers had been conclusively implicated.\"Only their mother can tell them apart,\" one investigator is quoted as telling the court in Bobigny, north of the French capital.There is reportedly a tense atmosphere in the court where the trial is taking place. On Tuesday, both twins were said to have been expelled from the courtroom for refusing to stand up.Police believe they have taken advantage of their resemblance to cover their tracks. A senior officer quoted by Le Parisien said the pair frequently exchanged clothes, phones and identification documents.Identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits during pregnancy. Because they originate from the same egg and sperm, they share exactly the same DNA, making forensic identification extremely difficult.With genetic data unable to distinguish between them, investigators relied on phone records, surveillance footage, wiretaps and efforts to corroborate their whereabouts and movements, according to Le Parisien.But the crucial question of who fired the recovered weapon remains an open one. The trial continues, with court due to reach a decision in late February.",

    "body": "1 day agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersA South Korean cryptocurrency exchange accidentally gave away more than $40bn (£32bn) worth of bitcoin to customers, briefly making them multi-millionaires.It had planned to give customers a small cash reward of 2,000 won - $1,37 - but instead gave them 2,000 bitcoins on Friday.The platform, Bithumb, apologised for the error, adding that it quickly had realised its mistake and recovered almost all the missing tokens. It said it had restricted trading and withdrawals for the 695 affected customers within 35 minutes of the glitch.The company said it had recovered 99.7% of the 620,000 bitcoins mistakenly sent. \"We want to make it clear that this matter has nothing to do with external hacking or security breaches, and there is no problem with system security or customer asset management,\" Bithumb said in a statement on Friday. In an emergency meeting on Saturday, South Korea's financial regulator said it would look into the incident. Any sign of illegal activity would prompt formal investigations, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).Bithumb vowed to co-operate with regulators. \"[We] will take this accident as a lesson and prioritise 'customer trust and peace of mind' rather than external growth,\" CEO Lee Jae-won said. The company plans to  pay 20,000 won ($13,66) in compensation to all customers who were using the platform at the time, and will waive trading fees, among other measures.Bithumb said it would improve verification systems and introduce AI to detect abnormal transactions.The incident is likely to spark discussion around tighter regulatory controls in finance. In April 2024 Citigroup, a US bank, mistakenly credited $81 trillion, instead of $280, to a customer's account. Two employees failed to spot the error before it was processed, but the bank reversed the transaction within hours after a third employee caught the mistake, the Financial Times reported.",

    "body": "2 days agoMax MatzaCBSThe co-owner of a Colorado funeral home where nearly 200 decaying bodies were found has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for corpse abuse.Before Jon Hallford was sentenced, he apologised in court and listened to family members describe having nightmares about their loved ones decomposing in his care. They called him a \"monster\" who should rot in jail.His ex-wife and co-owner Carie Hallford has pleaded guilty to similar charges and is awaiting sentencing.The Return to Nature home, in the town of Penrose, Colorado, had given fake ashes to grieving relatives instead of their loved-ones' remains. Prosecutors said 189 bodies were improperly stored in the building over four years.The courthouse was packed with family members on Friday, who asked the judge to impose the maximum 50-year sentence.\"I'm a daughter whose mother was treated like yesterday's trash and dumped in a site left to rot with hundreds of others,\" Kelly Mackeen told the court.\"I'm heartbroken, and I ask God every day for grace.\"The bodies were found in piles inside non-refrigerated areas of the funeral home. Victims included children and foetuses.\"It is my personal belief that every one of us, every human being, is basically good at the core,\" Judge Eric Bentley said.\"But we live in a world that tests that belief every day, and Mr Hallford, your crimes are testing that belief.\" Hallford, who had pleaded guilty in the hopes of a reduced sentence, apologised for his actions ahead of sentencing.\"I had so many chances to put a stop to everything and walk away, but I did not,\" he said. \"My mistakes will echo for a generation. Everything I did was wrong.\"Prosecutors say the couple was driven by \"greed\", and were earning enough money from the business to properly care for the bodies.Located about 30 miles (48km) south of Colorado Springs, the funeral home specialised in burials where no chemicals, including embalming fluid, were used and where remains were buried in a biodegradable casket.The business came under investigation after reports of a foul odour coming from the property. Officials discovered 115 bodies there early last October.Jon Hallford was accused by officials of attempting to conceal the \"improper storage of human remains\".Green funerals are allowed in the state but remains must be buried within 24 hours or be properly refrigerated.Funeral home operators in Colorado are currently not required to be licensed, have a degree in mortuary science or even graduate high school.Tougher legislation has been passed since the scandal erupted.",

    "body": "22 hours agoChris GrahamReutersSussan Ley said it was time to look to the futureAustralia's Liberal-National Coalition, the country's main opposition, reunited on Sunday, more than two weeks after the centre-right partners split in a row over hate speech laws.\"The coalition is back together and looking to the future, not to the past,\" Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley said, appearing alongside National Party leader David Littleproud in Canberra.The coalition split on 22 January after the Nationals refused to back reforms introduced by the government after two gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach in December, citing free speech concerns.\"It's been disappointing, we've got to where we are but it was over a substantive issue,\" Littleproud said.The coalition suffered a heavy election loss last year and the split last month was the second in less than 12 months.  Last year's separation in May - largely over climate and energy policy - was resolved within a week.This time the divisions were sown by hate speech reforms introduced by the centre-left Labor government after the Bondi Beach attack.While the Liberals sided with the government, their National colleagues abstained from the vote in the lower house and voted against the measure in the Senate, saying the measures had been rushed and posed a threat to free speech.The legislation includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence.Ley said the coalition had a responsibility to find a way back into government.\"I acknowledge this has been a difficult time. It has been a difficult time for millions of our coalition supporters and many other Australians who rely on our two great parties to provide scrutiny and leadership,\" she said.The Liberal leader said both parties had struck an agreement that neither party could overturn decisions taken by the coalition's joint \"shadow cabinet\".Dating back to the 1940s, the coalition had not split since 1987 before the brief separation last year. The National Party mainly represents regional communities and often leans more conservative than the Liberals.The coalition is facing pressure from populist Senator Pauline Hanson's anti-immigration One Nation party, which has surged in polling, while the Liberal Party lost a swathe of seats at last year's federal election.",

    "body": "6 hours agoChris GrahamGetty ImagesWill Lewis stepped down days after overseeing mass lay-offs at the US newspaperThe chief executive of the Washington Post is stepping down, the newspaper has announced, days after overseeing mass lay-offs.William Lewis said in a message to staff that it was the right time to leave and that \"difficult decisions\" had been made to ensure the paper's future.The newspaper had announced on Wednesday that it was cutting a third of its workforce, dramatically scaling back its coverage of sport and international news. The decision was condemned by many journalists and prompted criticism of the Post's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. Executive editor Matt Murray said the cuts would bring \"stability\".Jeff D'Onofrio, who joined as the newspaper's chief financial officer last year, will serve as acting publisher and CEO, the Post said as it announced Lewis's departure.A former Dow Jones chief executive and publisher of the Wall Street Journal, Lewis was appointed to the role at the Washington Post in 2023.He has faced criticism from subscribers and employees as he tried to reverse financial losses at the daily.Hundreds protested in front of the paper's headquarters in Washington DC on Thursday after the mass lay-offs, which included the paper's entire Middle East staff and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.A GoFundMe page has been set up to support international employees hired locally or from subsidiaries outside the US - and therefore not eligible for protections afforded to members of the Washington Post Guild, the paper's union - who may be facing a sudden loss of housing, visas or benefits.\"Among those laid off are reporters in war zones living without electricity, breaking news hub reporters and editors in Seoul and London who cover atrocities around the world every day, correspondents who upended their lives to move overseas just a few months ago, and indispensable local staff without whom our journalism would be impossible,\" organiser Michelle Lee wrote on the page on Saturday.\"They are a dedicated, talented, multilingual, brilliant bunch. They don't deserve this.\"The page had raised more than $180,000 (£130,000) out of a target of $200,000 as of Sunday evening.A separate GoFundMe page organised by the guild for US staff has already raised more than $500,000.Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor until 2021, said the cuts ranked \"among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organisations\".The departure of Lewis marks the latest upheaval for the leading US newspaper, which has seen a series of staff cuts and controversial editorial decisions in recent years.ReutersJeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, acquired the Washington Post in 2013The newspaper had endorsed a candidate in most presidential elections since the 1970s - all of whom had been Democrats. The move caused widespread criticism and led to the loss of tens of thousands of subscribers. Meanwhile, the opinion editor resigned in February last year when Bezos decided to focus the paper's comment section on \"personal liberties and free markets\". Bezos, who acquired the newspaper in 2013, said pieces opposing those views would not be published.",

    "body": "1 day agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesFinancial crime prosecutors in France say they have opened a preliminary inquiry into former Culture Minister Jack Lang over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.Lang, a major figure in French socialist governments between the 1980s and 2000s, is being investigated for suspected \"laundering of tax fraud proceeds\". It follows the US Department of Justice's release of the Epstein files, which have documented links between the Lang family and the late American sex offender.Lang, now 86, denies wrongdoing and on Saturday described the allegations against him as \"baseless\". He told AFP the investigation \"will bring much light on to the accusations that are questioning my probity and my honour\".Hours after the investigation was announced, Lang offered to resign as head of the Arab World Institute, a body that promotes cooperation and exchanges between France and Arab nations.In a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, seen by AFP, Lang said he would submit his resignation at the next board meeting. Barrot, who had summoned Lang for talks on Sunday, said he had acknowledged the resignation offer and planned to start the process of looking for a successor. Lang's daughter Caroline, 64, is also being investigated in the case. Earlier this week she stepped down as head of a French film producers' union.On Tuesday, he told broadcaster BFMTV he had known nothing about Epstein's crimes when he met him \"some 15 years ago\". The US financier was convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution.Lang - who served as culture minister between 1981 and 1993 and later as minister of education - says he was introduced to Epstein by US actor-director Woody Allen.He said he had found Epstein \"passionate about art, culture and cinema\".In a separate interview on Tuesday, he told RTL radio that Epstein had been \"generous\" and \"courteous\", adding: \"When I meet people I don't ask to see their criminal record.\"Details from the files revealed by French media suggest Lang appealed to Epstein for funds or favours on several occasions - including the use of Epstein's car and private plane for himself and his family.Caroline Lang told French news website Mediapart that she met Epstein in 2012, when he told her he wanted to \"invest in young French and international artists\".She said his lawyers had set up a company, Prytanee LLC, based in the US Virgin Islands. Mediapart said Caroline Lang had received half of the shares, but she said she had not invested in it or received any funds from it.An email in the Epstein files suggested she contributed her art knowledge, Mediapart reports. She told the website she had been \"incredibly naive\".Resigning from her post in the Independent Production Union, she said: \"I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union.\"The files do not suggest either Lang or his daughter were implicated in Epstein's sexual crimes.Epstein died in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.AFP via Getty ImagesLang (right) made his name in the 1980s, under the presidency of François Mitterrand (left)",

    "body": "10 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesThe lead singer and songwriter of US band 3 Doors Down, Brad Arnold, has died after a battle with cancer aged 47, the rock band announced on X.\"He will be deeply missed and forever remembered,\" the band said in a statement on Saturday. The band is best known for 2000s rock hits like Kryptonite, Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and Loser.Arnold had announced in May 2025 that he was ill and had received a diagnosis of stage four clear cell renal carcinoma - a type of kidney cancer - which had metastasised into his lung. \"I have no fear, I really sincerely am not scared of it at all,\" the frontman said, adding that he was disappointed that the band would have to cancel an upcoming tour.\"I'd love for you to lift me up in prayer every chance you get,\" he said.In its statement, 3 Doors Down said that, as a founding member, vocalist, and original drummer, \"Brad helped redefine mainstream rock music, blending post-grunge accessibility with emotionally direct song writing and lyrical themes that resonated with everyday listeners\".  The original band was formed in Mississippi in the mid-1990s. Another founding member of the original trio, Matt Roberts, died in 2016 at the age of 38.Arnold wrote Kryptonite, the band's 2000 breakout hit, \"in his math class when he was just 15 years old\", the statement continued.Those closest to Arnold will \"remember not only his talent, but his warmth, humility, faith, and deep love for his family and friends\", it said. He is survived by his wife, Jennifer.The band was regularly heard on rock and pop radio throughout the 2000s and 2010s. They have won three Billboard Music Awards.Their debut album The Better Life was the 18th biggest-selling album of 2000 in the US, according to Billboard.Arnold had spoken openly about his battle with alcoholism and his recovery, having been sober since 2016.\"I used to think it was a way to calm myself prior to a show or to chase loneliness,\" he told Charleston.com in 2023.The band performed for the inauguration of US President George W Bush as well as the first inauguration of President Donald Trump, which received some criticism from fans.Their manager, Angus Vail, defended the decision to perform for the 2017 Trump presidential celebration, telling Vice: \"They are good Mississippi and Alabama boys - they come from conservative families.\"In 2004, 3 Doors Down established a charity, the Better Life Foundation, to create \"positive change in the lives of children in need of food, shelter and medical assistance\". The band hosts a yearly concert to raise funds for the organisation.\"All the money that goes into that [charity] comes from fans, and people, that they give to us,\" Arnold told Antihero magazine in 2021.\"But being able to see what that's done over the years has definitely enriched my life.\"Correction 8 February 2026: An earlier version of this article said The Better Life was the 11th biggest-selling album of the year. This was later updated to say it was the 18th biggest selling album of 2000 in the US, according to Billboard.",

    "body": "Man named in South Africa's police corruption probe found dead14 hours agoDamian ZaneGetty ImagesA South African man named in a major police corruption probe has died after reportedly shooting himself at a petrol station.Police are now investigating the death of Wiandre Pretorius, 41, who last week said he had survived an assassination attempt.Pretorius's name had been mentioned at the ongoing corruption inquiry, known as the Madlanga Commission. This was in connection with the 2022 murder of a man, Emmanuel Mbense, allegedly at the hands of police officers.Four of the 12 people named as persons of interest in that killing are now dead themselves, a police spokesperson said.At 22:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Saturday the police received reports that a man had taken his own life at a petrol station in Brakpan, east of Johannesburg. At the scene, officers found Pretorius's body with a firearm next to it, spokesperson Brig Athlenda Mathe said.The police are now looking at CCTV footage to confirm what happened. There had been reports that Pretorius had been involved in a row with his fiancée at the petrol station before taking his own life.The murder four years ago of Mbense is one of several issues that has come up at the Madlanga Commission, which was set up by President Cyril Ramaphosa after a senior police officer alleged that organised crime groups had infiltrated the government.At a hearing last year, a man, only identified at the time as Witness D, said that in 2022 he had been ordered to get rid of the body of someone accused of robbery who had allegedly been tortured and killed by police officers.Witness D also alleged that Pretorius, who was not a policeman but had previously served as a police reservist, was involved.The witness, later named as Marius van der Merwe, was shot death three weeks after testifying.Police spokesperson Mathe said on Sunday that Pretorius had been questioned and his firearms confiscated in connection with Van der Merwe's killing.Mathe added that the death of Pretorius on Saturday night leaves only eight of the original 12 persons of interest in the killing of Mbense still alive.Three were killed \"execution style\" – one in 2023 and two last year.\"The question is: are we dealing with a syndicate that is eliminating each other in relation to the Emmanel Mbense murder? That is what our detectives are probing,\" Mathe told reporters.Last week, police began investigating whether Pretorius himself had been the target of an assassination attempt after he said that his vehicle had been shot at.In connection with the murder of Mbense, Mathe said that \"arrests are imminent\" following an investigation by the independent police watchdog body.More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

Authorities believe she was taken against her will.On Sunday, the sheriff's office said in a post on social media that no suspects, persons of interest or vehicles had been identified in the case.The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for information.Nancy Guthrie was discovered missing when she did not attend a Sunday church service on 1 February and other members grew concerned.Authorities say that early on Sunday morning, a doorbell camera in her home was disconnected and removed. At about 02:28 local time, the app connected to her pacemaker, an implanted cardiac device, was disconnected from her phone.FBI Special Agent Heith Janke has said the bureau was looking into a potential ransom note sent to several media outlets.ReutersAuthorities said on Friday that they were \"aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie\" and were \"inspecting the information provided in the message for its authenticity\".Janke said the note \"had facts associated with a deadline with a monetary value they were asking for\", NBC News reported.A presenter for a local CBS News affiliate told the BBC that her channel had received the \"message\" but did not detail its contents.According to news website TMZ, which reportedly received one of the letters, the kidnappers were demanding millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency, which is popular with criminals and often difficult to trace.BBC NewsThe family has released two previous videos saying they were willing to speak to the potential kidnapper, and asking to provide proof that her mother was alive.In a video on Thursday, Camron Guthrie - the son of the missing woman - confirmed  the family had not had any direct contact with kidnappers.\"We have to know that you have our mum,\" Camron said in the family's latest video message. \"We want to talk to you.\"The FBI did arrest one individual regarding a fake ransom note on Thursday.Family, and law enforcement, have warned that Nancy Guthrie may be at risk without her medication.\"She is without any medicine,\" Savannah Guthrie said in a previous announcement. \"She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.\"Watch: What we still don’t know about the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s motherThe Pima County sheriff's office said investigators had returned to conduct \"follow-up\" at Nancy Guthrie's home on Friday as part of their investigation. They also revisited the home of Annie Guthrie, Nancy's daughter and Savannah's sister on Saturday, according to multiple US news outlets.US President Donald Trump said last week that he had spoken to Guthrie and offered federal law enforcement help.\"I think we're doing very well, meaning we have some clues, I think that are very strong and I think we could have some answers coming up fairly soon,\" he told reporters on Friday.Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday that investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive.\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" he said. \"Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes.\"Savannah Guthrie, 54, is a US broadcast journalist who has served as the co-anchor of NBC News' Today since 2012. She is also the network's chief legal correspondent and a primary anchor for its election coverage. Previously, she was NBC News' White House correspondent.",

    "body": "8 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersFriday's shooting took place at a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of MoscowRussia says it has identified three suspects involved in the shooting of high-profile military figure Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev. They include the man accused of having carried out the attack, named as Ukrainian-born Russian citizen Lyubomir Korba. Russia's Investigations Committee (SK) said Korba arrived in the capital, Moscow, in late December \"on assignment from Ukrainian intelligence services to commit a terrorist attack\". Kyiv has reportedly denied involvement.Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of Moscow on Friday. He has since regained consciousness following surgery, according to Russian media reports.Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said on Sunday that his attacker had fired three shots before fleeing and that Korba had then travelled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the hours after the shooting. He has since been arrested and extradited. Russian state TV channel Ru-24 aired footage showing security agents escorting Korba off a plane at an unknown location.\"Investigators conducted a thorough inspection at the scene, during which they discovered the murder weapon - a Makarov pistol with a silencer and three rounds of ammunition,\" Petrenko added. Forensic tests are being carried out on the gun. Russian media, quoting Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, reported that President Vladimir Putin had thanked UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Saturday for his country's help in catching Korba.Russian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligenceUkrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha was quoted by Reuters as saying on Friday that Kyiv had nothing to do with the shooting, suggesting that it was an internal Russian affair. His Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov accused Kyiv of carrying out the attack as a way to disrupt negotiations on ending the war between the two countries, which began in February 2022. Alexeyev's boss, GRU head Adm Igor Kostyukov, has been leading the Russian delegation at recent trilateral talks with Ukraine and the US in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. Korba is alleged to have had at least one accomplice. A man named by the SK as Viktor Vasin has been arrested and charged by the authorities in Moscow.A woman named as Zinaida Serebritskaya, who has since left for Ukraine, is also thought to be involved, but Petrenko did not elaborate on how. Ukraine has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past, while Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time that it had been behind the attack.Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops.In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to the SK.Russia is also thought to have targeted high-profile Ukrainian military and political figures during the Russia-Ukraine war.Last July, Ukrainian security services said they had thwarted an attempt on the life of Serhiy Filimonov, commander of an assault unit known as the \"Da Vinci Wolves\".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has himself been subjected to numerous assassination and kidnapping plots, and Kyrylo Budanov - who until January this year was head of Ukraine's military intelligence - also says he has been targeted.",

    "body": "6 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandSimon AtkinsonBBCMany of the victims had moved to New Zealand to work or study, and some were refugees who thought they had found safetyA white supremacist who killed 51 people at two New Zealand mosques will appear in court this week to try to withdraw his guilty plea.Australian Brenton Tarrant is serving a life sentence with no parole after admitting to murdering the 51 people and attempting to murder another 40 in the March 2019 attack on worshippers during Friday prayers in Christchurch.He initially denied the charges, but changed his plea a year after the attack.The 35-year-old, who also admitted one count of terrorism, has now launched an appeal, filed out of time, arguing he was incapable of making rational decisions at the time because of \"torturous and inhumane\" conditions in prison. He also wants to appeal against his sentence. The hearing at New Zealand's Court of Appeal in Wellington is scheduled to run all week, with Tarrant expected to give evidence via video link.The massacre at Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre - parts of which were live-streamed - led to stricter gun laws in New Zealand.'He wants to open traumas again'Victims and family members will be able to watch the hearing via a delayed broadcast.Among those planning to attend is Aya al-Umari, who lost her older brother Hussein in the attack on Al Noor mosque.\"I very distinctly remember that I left court after the sentencing thinking 'Right, the trauma chapter is now closed, time to heal, time to focus on your own mental well-being', but then it pops up again and again,\" al-Umari told the BBC.She said she was preparing for a tough week, seeing the man who murdered her brother on screen.\"It will be just an image that I am looking at, because he means absolutely nothing to me at this stage.\"I suspect one of his main motivations to do this is to open up traumas again and I won't let him succeed in doing that - he just wants his limelight and to be relevant again.\"Hussein al-Umari was awarded a New Zealand Bravery Star, for standing up to Tarrant.\"He took the right of life of my brother and 50 others, and then we're going to sit through now and talk about the legal arguments of his right to appeal,\" al-Umari  said. \"When you place those two together, they are morally not comparable.\"Family handoutAya al-Umari and her brother HusseinAt the time of the sentencing in August 2020, then Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern said life imprisonment without parole meant Tarrant would have \"no notoriety, no platform... and we have no cause to think about him, to see him or to hear from him again\".If the three appeal court judges decide he can withdraw his guilty plea, the case would potentially go to trial on all charges.If he is not allowed to retract his plea, there will be another hearing later in the year to consider his appeal against his sentence.Tarrant was born in New South Wales, Australia, but moved to New Zealand in 2017 - which, prosecutors said, was when he started planning his attacks against the Muslim community.He was active on fringe online forums and before the attack, he had posted a 74-page \"manifesto\" online.The massacre prompted New Zealand to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners.Within a month of the shootings, the country's parliament had voted overwhelmingly to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms.The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme.",

The Narges Foundation says the latest sentence brings the total time she has been ordered to spend in prison to 44 years.Since 2021, she has been serving a 13-year sentence for \"propaganda activity against the state\" and \"collusion against state security\", charges she denies.The activist was given temporary release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison for three weeks in December 2024 on medical grounds.She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences.The most recent arrest came as she attended a memorial for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer who had been found dead in his office in early December.Norway-based group Iran Human Rights has called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances surrounding his death were \"suspicious\".The Narges Foundation previously said eyewitnesses had seen Mohammadi being attacked by around 15 plainclothes agents of the regime while at the memorial event, and that some were seen pulling her hair and beating her with clubs and batons.Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar told reporters that Mohammadi had been among 39 people arrested, and she and Alikordi's brother had encouraged those present \"to chant norm-breaking slogans\" and \"disturb the peace\".Mohammadi was among signatories of a petition that expressed criticism of the Iranian authorities and held Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responsible for what it called \"crimes against humanity\" over the killing of protesters during unrest that began in late December.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has counted more than 50,000 arrests related to the demonstrations and had confirmed at least 6,961 deaths.The petition called for the prosecution of those acting on Khamenei's orders and an end to the Islamic Republic.Four prominent Iranian activists - identified as Abdollah Momeni, Mehdi Mahmoudian, Vida Rabbani and Ghorban Behzadian-Nejad - have also been arrested since 31 January for their contribution to the petition.Taghi Rahmani urged the release of \"all political prisoners in Iran\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesJuan Pablo Guanipa (right) is a long-time ally of Maria Corina Machado (left)Venezuela has freed Juan Pablo Guanipa, a political ally of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, after eight months in detention, his son has said.The former vice-president of the National Assembly is among several political prisoners to have been released since the US captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in January.\"Our entire family will be able to hug again soon,\" Ramón Guanipa wrote on social media, cautioning: \"There are still hundreds of Venezuelans unjustly imprisoned.\"Opposition and human rights groups say the government under Maduro had for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.Though the interim government instituted in his absence promised on 8 January that \"a significant number\" of detainees would be released, this has progressed slowly in the weeks since, with a handful being released at a time.Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in Venezuela, says nearly 400 people have been released.Its president Alfredo Romero said at least 30 people had been freed on Sunday, including Guanipa. Perkins Rocha, Jesús Armas and Luis Tarbay were also named as having been released.Since Venezuela's widely disputed presidential election in 2024 - which saw Maduro officially re-elected despite opposition tallies suggesting their candidate had won by a landslide - critics of his regime said legal proceedings against activists, journalists and Maduro's political adversaries increased.Among them was Guanipa, who went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 result.He was tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025.Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado, who was also in hiding at the time, said her colleague had been \"kidnapped\" in \"an act of state terrorism\".Guanipa is the leader of the centre-right Justice First party. He was elected governor of the Zulia region but barred from taking office after he refused to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.ReutersGuanipa was tracked down and detained by Venezuela's security forces in May 2025With Maduro standing trial on drug trafficking charges in New York, Guanipa's son appeared sceptical a few days after the interim government announced its \"goodwill gesture\".Ramón Guanipa told BBC Mundo at the time that he felt \"defeated\" when his father was not among the first detainees to be released.\"But at the same time, you find another reason to fight,\" he said. \"I'm fighting for them [the interim government] to actually do what they say they're going to do.\"Releasing political prisoners was one of US President Donald Trump's demands of the interim government, describing it as \"a very important and smart gesture\" from Venezuela.He chose not to install Machado as Venezuela's president after capturing Maduro in a daring raid on Caracas, instead allowing Maduro ally Delcy Rodriguez to take over.",

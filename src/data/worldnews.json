    "body": "8 hours agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US \"has to have\" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't \"gonna push back too much\". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato.President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence to criticise \"lies\" about their clients. Jessica and Jacques Moretti were  \"devastated\", the lawyers told local media, but denied being aware of any dangers at their venue.\"There is a sort of public vindictiveness directed against them,\" one of the three lawyers, Yaël Hayat, said.Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling of the basement of Le Constellation bar in the popular ski resort of Crans-Montana. Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are being treated in hospital for severe burns.Many stories about the couple, the venue they managed, as well as their past have circulated in the local media since the fire, increasing pressure on the authorities as they investigate the accident and prosecute the owners.In an interview with Tribune de Geneve, the lawyers said the couple wanted to \"restore the truth\".Hayat said reports her client Jessica had left the burning building with cash from the register were a lie, telling BFMTV: \"In no way did she leave the scene in a hurry; she stayed there to help and support the injured.\"Patrick Michod, representing Jacques Moretti, said: \"When you run an establishment and a tragedy like this occurs, you feel responsible. Now, the major question in this case is the question of criminal responsibility, which is obviously not the same thing as the feelings one may have as the operator.\"Asked about the foam in the ceiling, Michod said his client obtained the material from a \"major construction retailer\" which did not disclose that it was flammable. \"He did not want to install a highly flammable foam. He wanted to install acoustic foam,\" he said. Lawyers representing the family of Cyane Panine, a staff member at Le Constellation who died in the blaze, said she had received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught fire. Hayat described Panine as a close friend of the couple, and pulled out a postcard she said had been written by her to the Morettis, Tribune de Geneve reported. \"I hope I will continue to grow alongside you and that we will spend many more New Year's Eves together [...] you are like my second family,\" the postcard said.The Moretti couple have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Last week, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued the couple present a flight risk and have asked judges to impose a 400,000-franc bail ($500,000; £374,000)as a condition for their release - 200,000 for each.Michod said that he had filed a request to release Jacques Moretti.

    "body": "Beijing has demanded the Taliban government protect its citizens after an explosion at a Chinese restaurant in the Afghan capital Kabul killed at least seven people.Six Afghans and one Chinese national were killed, and several more injured, in the blast at a Chinese restaurant in a heavily-guarded part of the city centre on Monday, officials told the media.The jihadist group Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the attack - although police in Kabul said the \"nature of the explosion is unknown so far and is being investigated\".China has urged its citizens not to travel to Afghanistan, where the Taliban seized control in 2021. Islamic State has claimed numerous bombings since then.  Speaking on Tuesday, Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun added that China had \"made urgent representations with the Afghan side, demanding that the Afghan side spare no effort to treat the injured, further take effective measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens\". City police spokesman Khalid Zadran said the explosion took place near the kitchen of the Chinese Noodle restaurant, which is located under a guesthouse in the  capital's Shahr-e-Naw area.Dejan Panic, the Afghanistan director of humanitarian group EMERGENCY, said they received \"20 people\" at their hospital, seven of whom were dead on arrival. Four women and a child were also among the injured.Footage circulating on social media of the aftermath of the explosion showed a large hole torn in the side of the building, Reuters news agency said.Eyewitnesses told BBC Afghan that a car outside the restaurant had been completely destroyed, and that locals had helped rush people in \"critical condition\" to hospital. Large sheets were later put up to cover the damaged building.Police spokesman Zadran said the restaurant mainly served Chinese Muslims, and was run by a Chinese Muslim man from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, his wife and his Afghan business partner.In its statement, the local branch of IS said that China was on \"the list\" of its targets, especially given China's \"increasing crimes against the oppressed Uyghur Muslims\".China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang.The Chinese government has denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.IS has previously said it was behind an attack on a Chinese-owned hotel in Kabul back in 2022, in which three of the attackers died and at least two other people were injured. More recently, Chinese nationals just over the border in Tajikistan have been targeted by unknown attackers. In November, six Chinese nationals were killed in three separate incidents. Beijing has told its citizens to leave the Tajik-Afghan border.",

    "body": "2 hours agoWatch: Veronika the cow shows off her unique skillsScientists are rethinking what cattle are capable of after an Austrian cow named Veronika was found to use tools with impressive skill. The discovery, reported by researchers in Vienna, suggests cows may have far greater cognitive abilities than previously assumed.Veronika, a cow living in a mountain village in the Austrian countryside, has spent years perfecting the art of scratching herself using sticks, rakes, and brooms. Word of her behaviour eventually reached animal intelligence specialists in Vienna, who found Veronika used both ends of the same object for different tasks. Antonio J Osuna MascaróVeronika, a Swiss brown cow living in AustriaIf it were her back or another tough area that warranted a good scratch, she would use the bristle end of a broom. When a softer touch was needed, such as on her sensitive underbelly, she would use the smooth handle end.This kind of tool use is rarely seen in the animal kingdom and has never been documented in cattle before.Dr Antonio Osuna-Mascaro of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna said: \"We were not expecting cows to be able to use tools, and we were not expecting a cow to use a tool as a multipurpose tool. Until now this has only been consistently reported in chimpanzees.\"Getty ImagesChimpanzees show sophisticated tool use, such as using a stick to get fruit from a boxChimpanzees show the most varied range of tool use outside of humans. They use sticks to gather ants and termites, and stones to crack nuts.However, despite about 10,000 years of humans living alongside cattle, this is the first time scientists have documented a cow using a tool.The researchers say their discovery shows that cows are smarter than we think and that other cows could develop similar skills, given the chance.As for Veronika's owner, organic farmer Witgar Wiegele, he hopes her unexpected talents will inspire people to value the natural world. As he puts it: \"Save the nature, then you protect yourself. Nature diversity is the key to survive on this planet.\"The study is published in the journal Current Biology.",

    "body": "Twelve school pupils have died in South Africa after the minibus they were travelling in collided with a lorry south of the city of Johannesburg.The crash happened on Monday morning at around 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) in Vanderbijlpark, the local education authority said.The 12 students had died at the scene, the authorities said on Tuesday - revising the figure of those killed down from 13 as was initially reported. Three others are being treated in intensive care with one of those being in a \"critically unstable\" condition.Police said the minibus driver crashed into the lorry after attempting to overtake two vehicles . He has been discharged from hospital and is now in police custody.Police spokesperson Mavela Masondo added that a case of culpable homicide would be opened.Gauteng province's education department said on Monday that the details of what happened to the lorry driver were \"uncertain\".Earlier, the provincial authorities had said 13 pupils had died - 11 at the scene and two later in hospital. A statement from Gauteng's health department on Tuesday revised the death toll downwards, saying that all the fatalities happened at the site of the collision.Fatal road collisions are common in South Africa, due to factors such as rampant speeding, reckless driving and poorly maintained vehicles.In 2025, 11,418 people died in crashes - about 6% lower than a year earlier but still equivalent to an average of 31 deaths a day.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Monday's crash \"distressing\". \"Our children are the nation's most precious assets and we must do all we can – from observing the rules of the road to the quality of service providers appointed to transport scholars - to protect learners,\" the president added.",

    "body": "1 hour agoHelen Livingstone,SydneyandSimon Fraser,LondonAustralia's parliament has voted for sweeping gun law reforms and a crackdown on hate speech, a month after two attackers shot 15 people dead at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach.Both bills passed the House of Representatives and Senate at a special sitting late on Tuesday. The gun reform measures include a national gun buyback scheme and new checks on firearm licence applications.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the Bondi gunmen would not legally have had access to firearms if such a law had been in place prior to the attack, the country's worst mass shooting in decades.Governing Labor senators were backed on the anti-hate bill by Liberal lawmakers, whose coalition partners abstained.After last month's mass shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came under huge pressure for not having done enough to prevent the attack in the first place, amid growing fears of antisemitism in the Jewish community. Politicians were recalled two weeks early to debate the legislation. Introducing the reforms, Burke said individuals with \"hate in their hearts and guns in their hands\" had carried out the 14 December attack.The father in the father-son duo allegedly behind the attack legally owned six firearms, while his son had been on the radar of intelligence agencies. The gun reform bill, which cleared the House of Representatives by 96 votes to 45, includes stricter firearm import controls and provisions to improve information sharing between intelligence agencies on people trying to obtain gun licences. The buyback scheme will target \"surplus and newly restricted firearms\", Burke said, reducing the country's four million registered guns.Burke added that it \"comes as a shock to most Australians\" to know that the country has more firearms that it did before the 1996 Port Arthur attack, in which a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania. That attack, the country's worst mass shooting, had prompted the then government to introduce some of the world's strictest gun controls. The new law will bring in some of the most significant changes to Australia's guns laws since then.The hate speech reforms had originally been included in an omnibus bill with the gun reforms but the government split the legislation last week after both the Liberal-National opposition coalition and the Greens said they would vote against.While the Labor government has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it needs the support of other parties in the Senate.Coalition MPs cited concerns about free speech and said the legislation was not clearly defined, among other things, while the Greens said they could not support it unless changes were made to protect all minorities and legitimate protest.But on Tuesday, Liberals leader Sussan Ley, who last week said the bill was \"unsalvageable\", said her party had reached agreement with the government on a watered-down version.The Liberals had \"stepped up to fix legislation\" that the government had \"mishandled\", she said in a statement, adding that the bill had been \"narrowed, strengthened and properly focused on keeping Australians safe\".The bill includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence. It will be subject to a review every two years by a parliamentary joint committee. The opposition will also be consulted on the listing and delisting of extremist organisations.The bill was passed by the lower house and late in the evening it cleared the Senate - by 38 votes to 22 - after the National Party abstained while their Liberal coalition partners voted in favour. The Greens voted against, saying it would have a \"chilling effect\" on political debate and protest.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris correspondentandPaul Pradier,in ParisFrench officials have made their first interception on the water as part of a new policy aimed at stopping small boats carrying illegal migrants to the UK.A so-called \"taxi-boat\" was boarded by French officers on Saturday on the Aa canal in Gravelines, which is on the Channel coast above Calais.It follows a change of tactics agreed in November following growing pressure from the UK government to step up interventions.A photograph of the aftermath of the operation obtained by the BBC shows a number of men - apparently people-smugglers - on an inflatable dinghy with the police launch alongside. The inflatable is then towed to the dockside.The French maritime prefecture declined to comment to the BBC, saying only that there was \"an ongoing judicial investigation\" regarding the small boat.France agreed to the new tactics at a summit in the UK last July between President Emmanuel Macron and Sir Keir Starmer.Until then French police had only intervened to stop small boats as they were being prepared for launch on beaches. Intervening at sea was judged to be too dangerous.But smugglers' gangs learned to avoid police by using \"taxi-boats\", which enter the water some distance away and then travel along the coast picking up groups of migrants who themselves enter the water to get aboard.According to an official French documents, this method was proving extremely effective, with an 81% success rate in 2025.The number of migrants who reached the UK from France rose last year from 36,566 in 2024 to 41,472, but it was lower than the peak of 45,774 in 2022.After the July 2025 agreement to start on-water interventions, there were more delays because of worries about the risk to life, and about officers' liability to prosecution were migrants to die in an operation.These concerns appear now to have been addressed.  Under the terms of engagement, gendarmes will only intervene to stop \"taxi-boats\" before they take on migrants – and not when they are fully charged.This seems to have been the procedure used in Saturday's operation. Police suspected that the inflatable, which was moving down the canal to its mouth at the sea, was about to be used for picking up migrants, so they moved to arrest the men on board.",

Joshua was treated in hospital for his injuries.Kayode arrived at Sagamu Magistrates Court in Ogun state on Tuesday, but the case was adjourned until the 25 February after the prosecutor was granted more time to gain legal advice.Kayode faced the court wearing a black hoodie, black shoes and a pair of black trousers. He did not speak during the hearing.He was previously released from custody after being granted bail of 5m naira ($3,500; £2,600).Joshua, a former heavyweight champion, was discharged from hospital two days after the Lexus SUV crashed on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway, in south-west Nigeria.Ghami and Ayodele were both pronounced dead at the scene, while 36-year-old Joshua was pictured being helped from the wreckage.Following the crash, the boxer posted a tribute to Ghami and Ayodele on Instagram, writing: \"I didn't even realise how special they are.\"I'll just be walking with them and cracking jokes with them, not even knowing God kept me in the presence of great men.\"100% it's tough for me, but I know it's even tougher for their parents.\"Social MediaThe former heavyweight champion was a passenger in the crash, which killed his team members Latif Ayodele (left) and Sina Ghami (right)Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town in Ogun state, near the crash site.He was on his way to visit relatives for New Year celebrations in the town at the time of the crash, a family member told the BBC.Kayode has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, reckless and negligent driving, driving without due care, and driving without a valid driver's licence.Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "China's birth rates sunk to a record low in 2025, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost it, as the country's population fell for the fourth straight year.Government data on Monday showed that the country's birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968.Its population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year.Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children.In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021.More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLaura Gozziin KyivReutersZelensky said repelling Monday night's attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m) just in terms of air defence missilesA large Russian aerial strike on Ukraine has again left half of Kyiv's residential buildings without heating or power as temperatures across the country continue to hover around -10C.Drones,  ballistic and cruise missiles targeted several locations in Ukraine, including Kyiv, Dnipro in the centre and Odesa in the south.Air raid alerts in the capital lasted for most of the night. On Tuesday, sirens rang out again as Russian drones and cruise missiles approached the capital.President Volodymyr Zelensky said a \"significant number\" of targets had been intercepted. But he also said that, in terms of air defence missile prices alone, repelling that attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m).Between Monday and Tuesday, at least four people died and 33 others were injured in strikes across Ukraine.On Tuesday morning, more than 5,600 residential buildings – each with dozens of flats – in Kyiv woke up to no heating. A large part of the capital also has no water.Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said almost 80% of those buildings had just had their heating restored following the large-scale attack on 9 January, which knocked out power for much of the city. Since then, relentless efforts by technicians had managed to reinstate electricity and gas for thousands - only for that work to be undone overnight.\"I have no electricity and no water,\" Oleksandr Palii, a 29-year-old veteran, told the BBC. \"I didn't sleep until 3am because of the strikes either – there were explosions all night.\"The Ukrainian president had been due to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday but, in the wake of the overnight strikes, he said he had decided to stay in Kyiv.He would travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a prosperity plan were ready to be signed, he added.Temperatures have stayed well below freezing since the start of the year. Ukrainian media has reported instances of radiators bursting due to the water in them freezing, leading to flooding in entire buildings. There have also been reports of fires starting due to people using gas heaters indoor.As the power cuts continue, Kyiv residents are finding innovative solutions to carry on living. Many now use portable stoves to cook, and entire buildings chip in to buy generators. But much depends on individual financial capacities.\"I think people who are less well-off are coping much worse,\" says Olha Zasiadvovk, who has a young child. She and other parents have bought lamps and thermal containers for their children's kindergarten \"so that when the kitchen has no electricity they can cook all the meals at once and store them.\"But if electricity is only available sporadically, she says, \"the food doesn't keep very well. There were cases when food was cooked in the morning and by dinner the porridge had become completely solid.\"In recent days, videos have circulated on social media showing Ukrainians barbecuing in snowy yards and dancing to keep warm in the face of continued power cuts and freezing temperatures. But many say this is the worst winter since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, and with no end to hostilities in sight, nerves are frayed.ReutersAround 10,000 people sought shelter in Kyiv's metro stations overnight\"The resilience of the Ukrainian people cannot be an excuse for this war to continue. It must end as soon as possible,\" said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ on Tuesday.The Kyiv city administration said more than 10,000 people, including nearly 800 children, took refuge in the city's metro stations on Monday night.Many of the high-rise buildings that are often hit by drones do not have shelters, so the deep metro system is still the only place people can seek safety as the thudding sounds of air defence systems ring overhead. President Zelensky said Ukraine had received missiles to repel the overnight attack on Monday, and added they had helped significantly.But he also emphasised the need for air defence systems was still critical. In a call with reporters, he said Russia was using \"far more\" ballistic missiles in its attacks and that Moscow's capacity to produce them had not been dented. \"So far, this has not happened. That is why we need more missiles and more air defence systems,\" he said.A flurry of diplomatic activity in late 2025 gave rise to hope that progress was being made towards a peace deal with Russia.But on Tuesday Zelensky hinted at concerns that growing tensions between the US and Europe could be detrimental to Ukraine's ability to defend itself. As it stands, Kyiv's European partners are buying missiles from the US on Ukraine's behalf.\"When it comes to [protection from] ballistic missiles, for now the key is in the hands of the United States of the America,\" he said.\"It is very important that deliveries are timely, that production works, and that partners help us purchase the necessary missiles,\" Zelensky stressed. \"In other words, a great deal in the security of Ukrainians depends on the unity of Europe and America.\"Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko.",

    "body": "8 hours agoMakuochi OkaforBBC Africa, LagosPolice in northern Nigeria say reports that worshippers were abducted on Sunday from churches in Kaduna state were false.In a joint statement with local government officials on Monday, Kaduna state police commissioner Alhaji Muhammad Rabiu described the information as \"mere falsehood which is being peddled by conflict entrepreneurs who want to cause chaos\".Earlier, a local official in Kurmin Wali had told the BBC that gunmen had kidnapped dozens of people attending different churches.There has been a series of mass kidnapping in Nigeria, where both Christians and Muslims have been targeted. Gangs frequently carry out such attacks to get ransom payments.But referring to Sunday's alleged abductions Kaduna's police commissioner challenged \"anyone to list the names of the kidnapped victims and other particulars\".The chairman of Kajuru local government area, Dauda Madaki, said security forces were sent to Kurmin Wali after reports of an attack, but found \"no evidence of the attack. I asked the village head, Mai Dan Zaria, and he said that there was no such attack.\"Police also quoted the state's commissioner for internal security and home affairs saying religious leaders visited the area.''They found out that what was pushed out to the public sphere was completely false,'' he reportedly said.However, a community leader in Kurmin Wali, Ishaku Dan'azumi Sarkin, had earlier told the BBC that armed men attacked the area on Sunday and kidnapped 177 people from three churches.He said 11 people escaped, several others were injured, and no deaths were reported.In November, more than 300 students and teachers were seized from a Catholic school. They were later released in two successive groups. It was among a spate of kidnappings that made international headlines.Nigeria is facing numerous security challenges - including kidnappings for ransom by criminal gangs, an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and a battle between herders and farmers in the centre over access to land and water.Experts say corruption, poor intelligence sharing and underfunded local policing have hampered efforts to tackle the various crises.Nigeria's defence minister resigned last month at the height of the kidnapping crisis, officially for health reasons, according to the president's office.The US has recently become militarily involved in Nigeria - launching airstrikes on Christmas Day on two camps run by an Islamist militant group in north-western Nigeria.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump warned of more strikes if Christians continued to be killed in the West African nation.There are more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria, which is roughly divided into a mainly Muslim north, a largely Christian south, with intermingling in the middle - and the government says people of all faiths have been victims of attacks.A Nigerian foreign ministry spokesman responded to Trump's warning by saying that Nigeria would continue to engage constructively with partners such as the US.''Nigeria remains committed to protecting all citizens, Christians and Muslims alike, without discrimination,'' Alkasim Abdulkadir said.",

They are then put in gated compounds, have their documents confiscated and are compelled to engage in cyber-crime.They often work on romance scams, where a victim is encouraged to send money to a fictitious partner who they believe is real, or business email compromise, where someone poses as an employer and gets people to sends funds or sensitive data.The weekend's operation was jointly co-ordinated by a host of agencies, including the Cyber Security Authority (CSA).''All the arrested individuals have been duly profiled and handed over to the Ghana Immigration Service for safekeeping and further investigations,\" Communications Minister Sam George said in a post on X.\"We caution foreign nationals invited to Ghana to verify claims made by their fellow nationals to lure them here.''George also indicated that suspects arrested in previous recent operations have been handed over to Nigerian law enforcement or are facing prosecution.The CSA and other agencies have been making efforts to flush out cyber-criminals, including working with the US authorities to arrest high-profile suspects. Among recent operations was the arrest of a popular Ghanaian social media influencer known as Abu Trica, whose real name is Frederick Kumi, who allegedly stole $8m (£5.9m) from vulnerable Americans through a romance scam. He has not yet commented on the allegations.Another successful operation was the dismantling of a syndicate that defrauded over 200 victims of $400,000 (£300,000).You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcastsMore from the BBC",

    "body": "24 hours agoSteve RosenbergRussia EditorReutersListen to Donald Trump and you would think Moscow and Beijing were lying in wait off the coast of Greenland, ready to pounce to boost their power in the Arctic.\"There are Russian destroyers, there are Chinese destroyers and, bigger, there are Russian submarines all over the place,\" President Trump said recently.That is why, according to America's president, US control of Greenland is essential.So how do you think Moscow has reacted to its alleged plot being uncovered and potentially thwarted by a US takeover of Greenland?The Russians can't be pleased. Right?Wrong.In an astonishing article, the Russian government paper is full of praise for Trump and critical of European leaders who oppose a US annexation of Greenland.\"Standing in the way of the US president's historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on 'drowning' the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life.\"\"Greatest deal\"? The reporter explains what he means. I have to keep reminding myself I am reading the Russian government newspaper, not a pro-Trump publication in America.\"If Trump annexes Greenland by July 4 2026, when America celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, he will go down in history as a figure who asserted the greatness of the United States,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"With Greenland, the US becomes the second largest country in the world after Russia, surpassing Canada in area. For Americans, that's on par with such planetary events as the abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 or the territorial conquests of the Napoleonic Wars.\"If, thanks to Trump, Greenland becomes part of America…for sure the American people will not forget such an achievement.\"And the Russian reporter has this message for America's president: don't U-turn.\"It is dangerous for the American president to back down over Greenland. This would weaken the position of the Republican Party in the midterm elections and likely result in a Democrat majority on Capitol Hill with the ensuing consequences for Trump. Whereas a rapid annexation of Greenland before the elections can change this political trend.\"In other words, it's in Trump's interest to push ahead with his plans to take over Greenland: according to the Russian government paper.Let that sink in.But why the praise from Moscow? Why the apparent encouragement?It's because Russia has much to gain from the current situation.Trump's fixation with Greenland, his determination to take over the island and impose tariffs on European countries that oppose his plan have put a huge strain on the transatlantic alliance: both on America's relations with Europe, and within Nato.Anything that weakens – or threatens to split – the Western alliance is viewed by Moscow as a huge positive for Russia.\"Europe is at a total loss and, to be honest, it's a pleasure to watch this,\" gloated the Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets in one of its articles about Greenland.What's more, American threats to annex Greenland are being used by pro-Kremlin commentators to try to justify Russia's war on Ukraine.Victory in Ukraine remains the Kremlin's priority. Moscow believes that maintaining a positive relationship with the Trump administration will help achieve this.Hence Russia's criticism of Europe. But not of Donald Trump.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here.

    "body": "9 hours agoTiffanie Turnbull,SydneyandKoh EweA surfer has been bitten by a shark, the fourth attack along Australia's New South Wales (NSW) coastline in under 48 hours.The 39-year-old man \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board on the Mid North Coast on Tuesday morning, police said. He has been released from hospital.It follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney's northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police. The attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for shark attacks. Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.The attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279 miles) north of Sydney.Steve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was \"very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries\", ABC reported. \"We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it's obviously an area where sharks congregate,\" Pearce said. \"If it's dirty water I'd think twice about going in there.\"A young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with \"life-changing\" injuries. On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was also critically injured when bitten at a popular Sydney Harbour beach.Authorities believe bull sharks were involved in most of the recent attacks.Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.Last November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach, also on the NSW Mid North coast.Bull sharks are typically seen around Sydney in January and February - the summer months in Australia - as the \"water is at their preferred temperature\", Dr Daryl McPhee, associate professor of environmental science at Bond University, told the BBC.Though Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute - making this string of shark attacks in NSW a rare phenomenon. \"This series of bites from bull sharks in such a short period of time is highly unusual,\" said McPhee.Police on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility.\"I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time,\" Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters.Rain can concentrate fish that bull sharks prey on downstream in rivers and beaches, McPhee said, adding that \"bull sharks are well adapted to feeding in murky water after rain\". \"Where you find the fish, you find the bull sharks. Unfortunately, that sometimes occurs at popular beach locations.\"",

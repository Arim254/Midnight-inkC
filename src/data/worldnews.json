    "body": "1 day agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat, a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine, Europe and even China, do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment, the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".WPA Pool/Getty ImagesZelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: \"The only thing that will unarguably, undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack, and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend.\"This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia.Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently, I heard no mention of any Spring offensive, only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure.Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president, pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains, designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace.According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs, in this year, Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long, not least fighting with one hand behind their back,' says Fiona HillFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, who served on Trump's national security council during his first term, says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. \"Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe,\" she says. \"Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.\"Trade, sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly, Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%, interest rates 16%, growth slowed, budget deficits soaring, real incomes plunging, consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. \"The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022,\" the authors say.But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking, not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions, such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via ReutersIn this year alone, Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded, according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi, said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would, he said, work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies.Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy, it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. \"We need to stop being cute and go full embargo,\" he said. \"We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention.\"In theory, sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October, a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt \"very tired\" of the conflict, up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy. ReutersThe Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called \"reparation loan\" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years.In Kyiv, officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held, has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday, the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court.Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns, such is its own vast debts, and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone.EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success.There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine, it could mobilise more of its armed forces.It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia), and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war, many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty ImagesUkraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed \"the fathers of the future\".This puzzles outsiders. \"I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people,\" one senior UK military figure told me. \"I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight.\"Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires, which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. \"Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].\"Strikes, diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles, it could hit Russia harder and deeper.This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. \"By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once.\"Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel.\"But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact, when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent? AFP via Getty ImagesAs well as defending its territory, Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan, former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. \"They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour, but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war.\"Dr Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure, as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. \"It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat,\" he said.More from InDepthThere's also - still - a diplomatic route.Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war, he may choose it.The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia, setting up negotiating teams, using its power to drive through agreement.\"The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia,\" Thomas Graham argues. \"One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.\"China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also hugely dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.ShutterstockPresident Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted, for transatlantic allies to be divided, and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated, if global markets were disrupted, if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy, then the thinking in Beijing might change.For now though, Putin believes he is sitting pretty, with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on, analysts say, the more Ukrainian morale will fall, the more divided its allies will become, and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin said last week.\"Nothing will change his position,\" Fiona Hill told me. \"Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.\"Top picture credit: Reuters BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "2 days agoAlex BoydGetty ImagesFive men have been arrested in Germany suspected of being involved in a plot to drive a vehicle into people at a Christmas market.Three Moroccans, an Egyptian and a Syrian were detained on Friday over the plan to target a market in the southern Bavarian state. Authorities said they suspected an \"Islamist motive\".Prosecutors said the Egyptian - a 56-year-old - was alleged to have \"called for a vehicle attack... with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible\". The Moroccans allegedly agreed to carry out the attack.Officials in Germany have been on high alert after previous attacks at Christmas markets, including in Magdeburg last December that killed six people.Authorities did not say when the planned attack was supposed to take place or which market was the target, though said they believed it to be one in the Dingolfing-Landau area, north east of Munich.German newspaper Bild reported the Egyptian man was an imam at a mosque in the area.Police said the Moroccan men - aged 30, 28 and 22 - were arrested accused of having agreed to commit murder, while the Syrian man, a 37-year-old, was accused of encouraging the suspects \"in their decision to commit the crime\".The five suspects appeared before a magistrate on Saturday and remain in custody.Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria's state interior minister, told Bild the \"excellent cooperation between our security services\" had helped to prevent \"a potentially Islamist-motivated attack\".Christmas markets are popular festive attractions throughout Germany, frequently attracting large crowds and significant tourism.Security at events has been increased in recent years, since an attack in Berlin in 2016 when a man drove a lorry into a market crowd, killing 12 people.",

Albanese said Mr Ahmed would \"undergo further surgery\" on Wednesday.At least 15 people have been confirmed dead after Sunday's attack in Sydney during an event to mark the first night of Hanukkah.Police have declared the attack as a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.\"He was trying to get a cup of coffee and found himself at a moment where people were being shot in front of him,\" Albanese said after the bedside visit. \"He decided to take action, and his bravery is an inspiration for all Australians. He is a very humble man.\"\"At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,\" the prime minister added. \"We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"He later added: \"Ahmed, you are an Australian hero.\"There has been nationwide support for the 43-year-old including from US President Donald Trump who commended his courage, and a US billionaire who donated $99,999 (US$ 65,000; £49,000) to Mr Ahmed, calling him a \"brave hero\".In the footage, Mr Ahmed is seen hiding behind a parked car before he leaps out.He runs at the alleged gunman and seizes his weapon, before turning the gun round on him. The suspected attacker then begins to retreat.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the  attackers.Mr Ahmed's father previously told the BBC that his son was driven to act by his \"sentiment, conscience and humanity\".He \"saw the victims, the blood, women and children lying on the street, and then acted\".",

    "body": "A suspected New Year's Eve terror plot by an extremist group has been foiled by federal authorities in Los Angeles, officials say. Four alleged members of the Turtle Island Liberation Front - an offshoot of a pro-Palestinian anti-government group - have been arrested on suspicion of planning a coordinated bombing attack in at least five locations across southern California, the FBI and LA law enforcement said on Monday.The suspects were apprehended last week while traveling to the desert east of Los Angeles to test improvised explosive devices, officials said.The FBI believes it has \"disrupted the plot\", but an investigation to identify other potential suspects is ongoing. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X on Sunday that the agencies prevented \"far-left\" extremists from executing  \"a massive and horrific terror plot\".Audrey Illeene Carroll, 30; Zachary Aaron Page, 32; Dante Gaffield, 24; and Tina Lai, 41, face charges including conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device, according to the complaint filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California. On 12 December, the group travelled to the desert with \"precursor chemicals\" and were allegedly going to create bombs with their wares, officials said during a media conference on Monday. A surveillance plane captured footage of their movements and the Los Angeles FBI SWAT team, along with the FBI, moved in and arrested the quartet without incident. The bombing plot involved explosive devices being planted at locations that targeted two US companies described as logistic centres at midnight on New Year's Eve in the Los Angeles area. The group also allegedly discussed attacking Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and vehicles with pipe bombs in January or February, according to the complaint said.  Carroll allegedly said: \"That would take some of them out and scare the rest of them.\"\"The successful disruption of this plot is a powerful testament to the strength of our unified response,\" said LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, adding that work through allied agencies \"prevented a potential tragedy and reaffirmed our shared commitment to safeguarding our communities\".",

    "body": "Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi was taken to hospital after being beaten when she was arrested last week, her family says.The 53-year-old human rights activist told them in a phone call on Sunday that she was brought to an emergency department twice after being \"attacked by plain clothed agents with severe and repeated baton blows to the head and neck\", according to the Narges Foundation.There was no comment from Iranian authorities, but they have said she was detained for making \"provocative remarks\" at a memorial ceremony in the city of Mashhad on Friday.The Nobel Committee and award-winning film-maker Jafar Panahi are among those calling for her release.Ms Mohammadi, the vice-president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran, was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights.She has spent more than 10 years of her life in prison. Since 2021, she has been serving a 13-year sentence on charges of committing \"propaganda activity against the state\" and \"collusion against state security\", which she denied.In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison on medical grounds.She has continued campaigning while undergoing treatment.On Friday, she gave a speech at a memorial ceremony in Mashhad for Khosrow Alikordi, a human rights activist and lawyer who was found dead earlier this month in what human rights groups described as \"suspicious\" circumstances.According to the Narges Foundation, eyewitnesses cited by Ms Mohammadi's family said that she was attacked by around 15 plainclothes agents at the memorial, and that some were seen pulling her hair and beating her with clubs and batons.On Sunday evening, Ms Mohammadi made a brief phone call to her family and told them that \"the intensity of the blows was so heavy, forceful, and repeated that she was taken to the hospital emergency room twice\", a statement said.\"She emphasised that she does not even know which security authority is currently detaining her, and that no explanation has been given in this regard. Her physical condition at the time of the call was not good, and she appeared unwell,\" it added.The Narges Foundation cited Ms Mohammadi as saying that she was accused of \"co-operating with the Israeli government\" and that they had made a death threat, telling her: \"We will put your mother into mourning.\"The statement said that two other activists detained at the memorial ceremony, Sepideh Gholian and Pouran Nazemi, were also beaten by the plainclothes agents.Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar told reporters on Saturday that Ms Mohammadi was among 39 people arrested.He said that she and Khosrow Alikordi's brother, Javad, had encouraged those present \"to chant norm-breaking slogans\" and \"disturb the peace\".The Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday that it was deeply concerned by what it called the \"brutal arrest\" of Ms Mohammadi and called on Iranian authorities to \"ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\".Jafar Panahi, fellow film-maker Mohammad Rasoulof and more than a dozen other activists said in a joint statement that what happened at Alikordi's memorial ceremony \"was a stark reflection of the worrying state of freedom and security, and, consequently, the inefficiency and lack of accountability of the authorities in today's Iran\".",

    "body": "Rob Reiner's son Nick arrested on suspicion of murder after director and wife found deadJust nowMadeline HalpertandRegan Morris,Los AngelesGetty ImagesRob Reiner (centre), wife Michele Singer (left) and son Nick Reiner (right), seen together in 2013. The couple were found dead in their home with multiple stab wounds, according to the BBC's US partner CBS NewsA son of film director Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner has been arrested and is being held on suspicion of murder after the couple were found dead in their Los Angeles home. The Los Angeles Police Department said on Monday that Nick Reiner, 32, had been arrested and that he was in custody with no bail. The deceased couple's 28-year-old daughter, Romy, found her parents in their home with multiple stab wounds on Sunday, sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News.Rob Reiner was known for directing several iconic films in a variety of genres, including When Harry Met Sally, This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, Misery and A Few Good Men.The case is expected to be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office on Tuesday, when prosecutors will decide about filing charges.Emergency services were called to provide medical aid at the Reiners' home in Brentwood, California, at about 15:38 local time (23:38 GMT) on Sunday. The Los Angeles Fire Department said two people - later identified as Rob Reiner, 78, and his wife Michele, 68 - were pronounced dead at the scene.Police said Nick Reiner was arrested several hours later, at about 21:15 local time. Investigators have not publicly outlined a motive, and say the investigation is ongoing.Two sources also told CBS News that Rob and Nick Reiner had engaged in a brief but loud argument during a party the previous evening.Nick Reiner has spoken publicly about his struggles with addiction and homelessness. His experiences formed the basis of the semi-autobiographical film Being Charlie, which he made with his father in 2015.The family's home is in Brentwood, a wealthy celebrity enclave full of large mansions, boutique shops and restaurants. On Monday morning, a security guard stood outside the home as media gathered outside the front gate.Watch: \"Lucky\" to have parents that \"care about me\", says Nick Reiner in 2015 interviewRob Reiner, the son of comedy great Carl Reiner, began his career in the 1960s and rose to fame playing Meathead in the TV sitcom All in The Family.He cemented his success with the cult mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap in 1984, which he directed and starred in. Reiner was married to Laverne & Shirley actress Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981 and is the adoptive father to Marshall's daughter, actress Tracy Reiner.He married Michele Reiner in 1989, who he said he met during the making of the romantic comedy-drama film When Harry Met Sally. The couple have three children together.Getty ImagesRob Reiner and his family, including son Nick attend a movie premiere Michele Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.Rob Reiner was also known for his outspoken political activism and support for Democratic candidates. In a post calling their deaths \"very sad\", President Donald Trump criticised Reiner, saying that they \"reportedly\" died \"due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction\" with \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\".\"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump,\" the president wrote.It is not clear what reports the president was referring to, and while the investigation is being treated as a homicide, police have yet to comment on any possible motive. The president and his allies often used the term \"Trump derangement syndrome\" in reference to those who are critical of him. Reiner was a vocal critic of Trump's. Several Republicans criticised Trump over the post, including former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said the deaths were a \"family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies\". \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder,\" she said. \"These go to 11\" - watch Rob Reiner in the amplifier scene from This is Spinal Tap, one of the films he directedTrump's post was also met with anger by some of the Reiners' friends.In a post on X, Maria Shriver, the former first lady of California and longtime friend of the Reiners, said the couple were \"devoted parents\". \"They deeply loved all their children and they never gave up trying to care for them,\" she said. Sir Elton John, who made an appearance in this year's Spinal Tap sequel, said: \"I am in disbelief at today's news of Rob and Michele.\"They were two of the most beautiful people I'd ever met and they deserved better.\"Fellow actor John Cusack, who appeared in Reiner's 1985 film The Sure Thing, called him \"a great man\", while Elijah Wood, who starred in 1994's North, said he was \"horrified\" by the couple's deaths.",

    "body": "1 day agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, SantiagoReutersJosé Antonio Kast will be inaugurated as Chile's president in March next yearChile has elected the far-right wing José Antonio Kast to be its next president, after an election campaign that was dominated by themes of security, immigration and crime.Kast beat the governing left-wing coalition candidate Jeanette Jara decisively with more than 58% of the vote in his third attempt at running for president.It marks the biggest shift to the right since the end of Chile's military dictatorship in 1990. Kast has openly praised Chile's former right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet.In his first speech to supporters as president-elect, Kast said: \"Chile will once again be free from crime, free from anguish, free from fear.\"\"Criminals, delinquents - their lives are going to change. We're going to look for them, find them, judge them and then we're going to lock them up,\" he added.At a gathering of his backers in the capital Santiago, many draped in Chilean flags, chanting and taking selfies, there was jubilation as the results came through.\"I'm happy we can recover the country's security and patriotism,\" said Augustina Trancoso, donning a red \"Make Chile Great Again\" cap.\"We've been trying to win an election for years,\" said Belem Valdivieso. \"In Chile, you used to be able to walk the streets peacefully, lately we've experienced problems with insecurity. I'm hoping his promises will be kept and he'll focus on security.\"Throughout the campaign, Kast portrayed Chile as a country that was descending into chaos and insecurity. He pledged to restore order and crack down on irregular immigration, as well as implementing sharp spending cuts.Kast is an admirer of Donald Trump, who is likely to become a close ally, and his policies echo those of the US president. He has pledged a border wall on Chile's porous frontier with Peru and Bolivia, maximum-security prisons, and mass deportations of irregular migrants, many of whom are from Venezuela.Augustina Trancoso voted for Kast in Sunday's presidential electionChile is one of the safest and more stable countries in South America, but a rise in immigration and organised crime in recent years has concerned many voters. Kast regularly drew links between the two.His critics, though, say the problem is being exaggerated.One voter in Santiago, Javiera Carrasco, liked some of Kast's policies but ended up voting for Communist Party member Jara. She said she felt \"like a false sense of insecurity is becoming widespread.\"\"In other countries, there are much worse things happening than here. It just doesn't add up for me.\"Chile's murder rate is now falling, and some studies suggest those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average. But the perception of growing insecurity was the motivation for many of Kast's voters.\"We are transforming into Colombia, a lot of terrorism, thieves, robbery, society is very unsafe,\" one voter Max Struber said.\"It may sound harsh to say it, but we need the government to continue Pinochet's work. Human rights abuses existed, that's true. But as a government it was good, we used to have peace and tranquility.\"Kast's brother was a minister during Pinochet's dictatorship, and his father was a member of the Nazi party. Pinochet was an army general who led a US-backed military coup in 1973 and established a 17-year-long military dictatorship that was marked by brutal human rights abuses, forced disappearances and free-market economic policies.ReutersCommunist Party member Jeannette Jara was the left-wing coalition candidateChile's current left-wing President Gabriel Boric, who could not run again, had suffered from low approval ratings. Kast's rival Jeannette Jara may have suffered by being seen as a \"continuity vote\".A supporter at his victory party, Francisco Otero, said neither candidate represented everybody perfectly, but that a continuation of the government was seen as \"much worse\".After the result Jara posted that \"democracy has spoken loud and clear\" and wished Kast \"success for the good of Chile.\"\"We will continue working to advance a better life in our country,\" she added.Her supporters fear Kast's election marks a return to Chile's far-right past.\"Kast's family helped the dictator Augusto Pinochet,\" Ricardo Herrera said, adding that he lived through Pinochet's dictatorship and it was \"brutal\".Some are sceptical, though, that Kast will actually do what he's pledged.\"Kast says he wants to expel 360,000 undocumented migrants. He won't be able to do that. It's physically impossible,\" one voter Hector Lunes said.Ricardo Herrera, who lived through Pinochet's rule, voted for Jeannette JaraKast has also been firmly against abortion, even in cases of rape, and environmental protection policies.His victory will likely be welcomed by investors as he has pledged a free-market approach to economics to shrink the state and deregulate certain industries.This was the first presidential election in Chile where voting was mandatory and registration was automatic for those eligible.This left some voters feeling like they had to pick whichever they say was the \"least-worst\" option.\"I don't know if I'd say the lesser of two evils, but I think Chile needs a change,\" Claudio Sanjuez said, \"and I clearly think Kast could be that alternative\".\"Both candidates were like opposite extremes,\" Cintia Urrutia said, but added she'd hoped for Jeannette Jara who she perceived as more \"centrist\".Kast's victory in Chile follows a string of elections in Latin America that have shifted the region to the Right in recent years – including in Argentina, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.He will be inaugurated on 11 March 2026. At rallies, he regularly counted down the days until this date warning undocumented immigrants that they should leave before then if they ever want the chance to return.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS President Donald Trump has repeated his criticism of Rob Reiner - after his earlier remarks about the killed Hollywood director, a longtime Trump critic, sparked widespread condemnation.The US president told reporters the director was \"very bad for our country\", having earlier written on Truth Social that Reiner's death was linked to \"Trump derangement syndrome\" - a term he often uses to describe his critics.Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner were found dead at their Los Angeles home on Sunday, and police have arrested their son Nick on suspicion of murder.They have not suggested any motive in the case, or any evidence that Reiner's politics and criticism of Trump played any role.In his social media post, which called the couple's deaths \"very sad\", Trump criticised Reiner, saying: \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump.\"Those comments were widely criticised, including by prominent Republicans.Kentucky representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who has clashed with Trump since the president returned to the White House in January, wrote on X: \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.\"He added: \"I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once a staunch supporter of Trump before recently becoming a frequent critic, said that \"this is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies\" and that the murders should be \"met with empathy\".Multiple other senior members of Trump's party appeared to distance themselves from the remarks. Senator John Kennedy, a Republican representing Louisiana, said he thought Trump should not have made the comments.\"I think a wise man once said nothing. Why? Because he was a wise man,\" Kennedy said. \"I think President Trump should have said nothing. I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements.\"Reiner was a lifelong Democrat and prominent liberal activist, and frequently spoke out against Trump.In 2017, for example, he called Trump \"mentally unfit\" for office. And as recently as October, Reiner said he believed Trump was ushering in an age of \"full-on autocracy\" in the US.Hours after his social media post, Trump repeated his thoughts on Reiner in comments given in the Oval Office to reporters, describing the director as a \"deranged person\" who was partly \"behind\" previous claims of collusion between Russia and Trump's team.\"I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form,\" he said.Trump has in the past criticised political foes after their death.Following the death of Arizona Senator John McCain - with whom he clashed regularly - in 2019, for example, Trump said he \"was never a fan\" and \"never will be\".In another incident the same year, Trump quipped that the late Democratic lawmaker John Dingell could be \"looking up\" at him from the grave, a comment which was widely interpreted as a suggestion that Dingell was in hell.In a statement following the remarks about Dingell, the White House said that the president was \"just riffing\".Reiner, who was 78, was known for directing several iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, Misery and A Few Good Men.He married Michele, an actress, photographer and producer, in 1989, later recalling that they met during the making of one of his best-known films, When Harry Met Sally. The couple had three children together - including Nick, 32.Michele, 68, owned the Reiner Light photography agency and production house.",

    "body": "The US has said it is ready to offer Ukraine Nato-like security guarantees to safeguard an eventual ceasefire, following talks in Berlin with European officials and a delegation from Kyiv.The \"very strong\" guarantees would be modelled on Nato's Article 5 clause of mutual protection, US officials said, adding that the Russians would hopefully agree to them.While US officials talked up progress towards ending the war, there was little detail on how the thorny issue of Ukraine's sovereignty would be resolved in any peace deal.  Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky described the meeting as \"productive\" but not easy. He added that Kyiv needed a \"clear understanding of security guarantees\" before it could make any decisions about other contentious issues.Ukraine has long argued it needs watertight guarantees to ensure that Russia respects any ceasefire and does not attack the country again. US officials described the security guarantees on offer as the \"platinum standard\", but cautioned the deal \"would not be on the table forever\". On Sunday, Zelensky signalled for the first time that as a \"compromise\" he would give up ambitions to join Nato in exchange for strong guarantees.While there appears to be significant movement on the issue of security, the eastern region of the Donbas remains a major sticking point. The US is now suggesting an \"economic-free zone\" could be established in the contested part of the Donbas, but that would require Ukraine accepting to withdraw from the areas it still holds, while Russia would not be expected to do the same.\"It seems to me that [the US and Ukraine] so far have different positions, to be honest,\" Zelensky said.US officials said that if the economic free zone could be defined, \"then it will really be up to the parties to work out the final issues of sovereignty.\"But Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on the issue of the Donbas. Russia mostly occupies the region and it wants Kyiv to hand it over in its entirety, which Ukraine is staunchly refusing to do.The US officials said Washington was now willing to submit a security package for Senate ratification.Speaking from the White House, US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Zelensky and European leaders, describing it as a \"very good talk\". \"I think we're closer now than we have been, ever,\" he said, referring to reaching a peace deal.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who hosted the discussions, struck a similar tone earlier on Monday, saying \"this is the first time a ceasefire is conceivable.\"\"It's a huge progress which I welcome very much,\" he said, describing Washington's security guarantees as \"remarkable\". Several European leaders, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, will join further talks with the Ukrainian and US delegations on Monday evening. At the core of the discussions in Berlin is the 20-point peace plan proposal which Ukraine presented to the US last week, to counter an initial American plan which was seen as heavily favouring Russia.Details haven't been shared, but last week Zelensky said the points should be seen as a \"foundation\" on which to build provisions for the reconstruction of Ukraine and security guarantees.Any proposal hashed out by the Ukrainian, American and European side will still have to be presented to Moscow – although Zelensky said that the US delegation \"so to speak present the Russian side's perspective, because they relay Russia's signals, demands, steps, and indications of readiness or lack thereof.\"The Kremlin said it expected the US to provide it with the \"concept\" discussed on Monday.The talks in Berlin come at a crucial time for Ukraine, which is enduring its fourth winter of war amid sustained power cuts caused by Russia's attacks on its energy facilities. Over the weekend more than a million Ukrainian households were left without electricity following a barrage of strikes. Zelensky said on Monday that there was not a \"single functioning power station\" that had not been attacked by the Russians. Later this week, EU countries will be voting on a plan to send €90bn (£78.6bn) worth of frozen Russian assets held in a Belgium-based financial institution to prop up Ukraine's economy.On Friday, EU governments agreed to immobilise the Russian assets indefinitely - but there is no consensus yet on whether they can be sent to Ukraine. Belgium has been resisting the legally contentious proposal, and in recent days other countries, including Italy, have said \"alternative options\" should be put forward.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas acknowledged the discussions were \"increasingly difficult\". \"But we're doing the work, and we still have some days,\" she added.",

    "body": "Smooth end to Messi India tour after Kolkata chaos 22 hours agoAbhishek DeyDelhiAFP via Getty ImagesMessi concluded his India tour with an event at a stadium in Delhi on MondayFootball superstar Lionel Messi has wrapped up his three-day India tour in pollution-choked Delhi, after a chaotic opening in Kolkata.On Monday, thousands of fans gathered in a Delhi stadium to get a glimpse of the Argentina and Inter Miami forward.As Messi, accompanied by Inter Miami team-mates Luis Suárez and Rodrigo De Paul, strolled on the pitch - kicking balls into the stands, passing with a group of children and signing autographs - the crowd chanted his name.His flight from Mumbai had been delayed due to fog, local media reported, and his itinerary had to be trimmed. On Saturday angry fans vandalised a Kolkata stadium  because they didn't get to see him during his appearance there.Getty ImagesA fan holds a jersey of Messi at the event in DelhiAFP via Getty ImageMessi played football with children at a stadium in DelhiMessi had a packed schedule in India, attending a string of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad and Mumbai since arriving in the early hours of Saturday.Before heading to Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium later that day, he virtually unveiled a 70ft (21m) statue of himself, assembled over 27 days by a 45-strong crew in the eastern city.The tour, however, got off to a disastrous start after angry fans ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch at the stadium.Football is hugely popular in West Bengal state - of which Kolkata is the capital - and thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to attend the event.However, most of them didn't even get to see him as he was surrounded by officials and celebrities on his brief walk around the stadium and then quickly whisked away as the situation turned hostile.Kolkata's The Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\", as fans - denied even a glimpse of Messi - \"vented their anger by indulging in violence\".The ruckus, which made international headlines, cast a shadow over Messi's first visit to India since 2011 for what has been called a 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour'.The event organiser in Kolkata has been arrested, police said, and a city court has remanded Satadru Dutta to 14 days in police custody.Messi's visits to Hyderabad and Mumbai passed off smoothly, with fans sharing their delight at seeing the global icon online and in media interviews.Anadolu via Getty ImagesMessi virtually unveiled a 70ft statue of himself in KolkataGetty ImagesMessi met Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in MumbaiMessi also met several politicians and celebrities - Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan in Kolkata (at his hotel before the stadium fiasco), opposition leader Rahul Gandhi in Hyderabad, and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.In between these interactions, Messi could be seen waving to large fan gatherings in stadiums and dribbling the ball with groups of children.There were reports earlier that Messi would meet Narendra Modi in Delhi, but the Indian prime minister left the country on Monday morning on a scheduled visit to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman.Messi's popularity stems not just from his long international career and wide TV coverage of European football - he's record scorer for Barcelona, the team he used to play for - but also the emotional connection that millions of Indians have with what is often called the beautiful game.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyPolice 'put their lives on the line', says New South Wales premierThe New South Wales premier has rejected criticism of the police response to the attack on a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach, saying officers acted with \"bravery and integrity\".Some witnesses have suggested police were too slow to disarm the two gunmen, who killed 15 people and injured dozens in Australia's most famous beach on Sunday.\"There are two officers in critical care... at the moment,\" Chris Minns said after sustained questioning from reporters. \"They weren't shot in the back as they were running away. They were shot in the front.\"The gunmen went on a shooting spree that lasted around ten minutes before police shot both men, killing one and critically injuring the other.There have also been questions about whether adequate security was provided before the shooting took place.\"They shoot, shoot, change magazine and just shoot,\" one witness, Shmulik Scuri, told reporters the day of the assault, adding he thought officers \"froze\".Asked about these criticisms, Minns said the \"rush to conclusions\" about the police operation was \"disrespectful\".\"They didn't take a backward step. They engaged the gunmen on the footbridge with handguns. The offenders had long range rifles,\" Minns said.\"If there's any suggestion that NSW Police didn't live up to their responsibilities to the people of this state, it should be rejected because it's not consistent with the facts.\"NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon avoided questions about how many officers had been deployed to police the event in advance. He told reporters police \"regularly patrol that area as we did on that day\" and that police presence was based \"on the threat that exists at the time\".Australia's security agency has said the younger alleged gunman in the father-son duo, Naveed Akram, had come to their attention in 2019 due to his associations, but that there was nothing to suggest he was a risk of violence.\"Had there been intelligence that there was a particular threat at that location, or to that event, we may have had a different policing response,\" Commissioner Lanyon said.NSW Police established Operation Shelter after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel to investigate antisemitic hate crimes. As part of the operation, regular patrols are conducted of high-risk locations. The eastern suburbs of Sydney, including Bondi, which has a significant Jewish population, is a key focus.Another taskforce, Strike Force Pearl, was set up later to investigate hate crimes in Sydney.AFP via Getty ImagesDr Vincent Hurley, a former police officer who lectures on policing at Macquarie University, told the BBC it was \"unrealistic\" to expect police to be able to know how to react to every possible scenario. \"To respond to a mass shooting and mass killing event like that, there's no training that can be done.\"He pointed out that police officers would have initially been reliant on calls to emergency operators \"and everyone would have given them a different story\".\"Then they have to fight through traffic at Bondi Beach which is a nightmare at the best of times.\"At the scene, police would have been confronted with \"absolute chaos\" as thousands of people attempted to flee.Individual officers would also have been faced with difficult choices such as whether to stop and render assistance to injured individuals or to go and look for the gunmen, decisions for which there is no protocol.And even once the offenders had been identified, he says the risk of hurting bystanders in the crossfire would have complicated responses.\"There would be no way as a police officer, I would have drawn my firearm because all of the innocent individuals\", he added. \"It's not what you see on Netflix.\"",

    "body": "Dashcam video shows couple trying to stop gunman before being killed in Bondi attack1 hour agoFrancesca GillettandAnna LamcheWatch: Dashcam video shows couple fight with attackerA couple killed in the Bondi Beach shooting tried to stop one of the alleged attackers by grabbing his gun, dramatic dashcam footage shows.Boris Gurman, 69, and his wife Sofia, 61, courageously stepped in to try and protect others before being shot themselves, their family said in a statement.Video of the incident shows Mr Gurman, who was retired, wrestling with one of the alleged gunmen and taking the weapon off him, before they both fall onto the road. Mr Gurman then gets up and appears to hit the suspected attacker with the gun. The attacker is then thought to have got another gun which he used to kill them.\"While nothing can lessen the pain of losing Boris and Sofia, we feel an overwhelming sense of pride in their bravery and selflessness,\" the family said.\"This encapsulates who Boris and Sofia were - people who instinctively and selflessly tried to help others.\"The Gurman couple, who were Jewish, were the first two people killed in Sunday's attack, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.At least 15 people have been confirmed dead in the shooting, which happened during an event to mark the first day of Hanukkah.In their statement, the family said the couple had been married for 34 years.\"We are heartbroken by the sudden and senseless loss of our beloved Boris and Sofia Gurman.\"Boris was a retired mechanic, known for his generosity, quiet strength and willingness to lend a hand to anyone in need. \"Sofia worked at Australia Post and was deeply loved by her colleagues and community. \"Bondi locals, together they lived honest, hardworking lives and treated everyone they met with kindness, warmth and respect. Boris and Sofia were devoted to their family and to each other. They were the heart of our family, and their absence has left an immeasurable void.\"GoFundMeThe couple were due to celebrate their 35th wedding anniversary in January, their family said Witnesses have described Mr Gurman as a \"hero\".The woman who owns the dashcam footage told Reuters that Mr Gurman \"did not run away - instead, he charged straight toward the danger, using all his strength trying to wrestle away the gun and fighting to the death\".\"I can see from my camera that the elderly man was ultimately shot and collapsed. That moment broke my heart,\" she said.Another person who said they witnessed the incident told 9News: \"He was a hero. He tried, he tried. We need to let his family know.\"Everyone needs to know what he tried, because it was right in the beginning. And he put himself in that face of danger. There were bullets flying already, and he put his self in the face of danger.\"Police have described the attack as a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.The other victims killed include a 10-year-old girl, a British-born rabbi, a retired police officer, and a Holocaust survivor.The ages of the victims range from 10 to 87.A further 22 people remain in hospital, nine of whom are in a critical condition.Earlier this week, another bystander named Ahmed al Ahmed, 43, was also hailed a \"hero\" after he wrestled a gun from one of the attackers. He was shot multiple times  but survived, and has since undergone surgery for his wounds.His father told BBC Arabic his son was driven by his \"conscience\" and \"saw the victims, the blood, women and children lying on the street, and then acted\".Police have alleged that the attack was carried out by Sajid Akram, 50, and his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram.According to Australian media, Naveed Akram has woken from his coma and is conscious in hospital. Sajid Akram was found dead at the scene on Sunday, police said.Police said the pair travelled to the Philippines in the weeks before the attack, and officers are now investigating why they made the trip. Unconfirmed media reports say the two suspects received \"military-style training\" while in South East Asia.They arrived on 1 November and left on 28 November, the country's immigration bureau confirmed to the BBC.Police also said the two alleged gunman appear to have been motivated by Islamic State (IS) ideology, and they found \"homemade\" IS group flags and improvised explosive devices in the vehicle used by the suspects.",

    "body": "1 hour agoEmery Makumeno,BBC Africa, KinshasaandWycliffe MuiaA French court has sentenced a former rebel leader and politician from the Democratic Republic of Congo to 30 years in jail after finding him guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity more than two decades ago.Roger Lumbala headed a rebel movement backed by neighbouring Uganda accused of committing atrocities during a period known as the Second Congo War.The judge said the 67-year-old was found guilty of ordering or aiding and abetting torture and inhumane crimes, summary executions, rape constituting torture, sexual slavery, forced labour and theft.Lumbala, who was living in France when he was arrested nearly five years ago, has refused to accept the legitimacy of the court in Paris.He did not attend the trial, which began last month, though he was in the dock to hear the verdict on Monday.Lumbala also served as a minister in DR Congo's transitional government from 2003 to 2005 and later as a member of parliament.Several years later the Congolese government issued an arrest warrant for him over his alleged support for the M23, a rebel group currently active in the eastern DR Congo, prompting him to flee to France.The Second Congo War, which raged from 1998-2003, involved nine countries, numerous rebel groups and led to the estimated deaths of between two and five million people.At the time Lumbala led the Rally of Congolese Democrats and Nationalists (RCD-N), which allegedly carried out atrocities during a campaign between 2002 and 2003 called \"Erase the Slate\".The operation targeted members of the Nande and Bambuti ethnic groups in the north-eastern provinces of Ituri and North Kivu who were accused of supporting a rival militia.A UN team that investigated in its aftermath said it was characterised by \"premeditated operations using looting, rape and summary execution as tools of warfare\".Lumbala's case was prosecuted under the principle of \"universal jurisdiction\", which allows French courts to seek justice related to crimes against humanity committed abroad.Five non-governmental organisations, including Trial International and the Clooney Foundation for Justice, pooled their expertise to participate in the trial, helping support survivors to testify and requesting expert analyses.Trial International, a Geneva-based justice campaign group, said 65 survivors, witnesses and experts testified before the court about the Erase the Slate operation.After the verdict, it issued a statement from two of the survivors - David Karamay Kasereka and Pisco Sirikivuya Paluku.\"We were scared but came all the way here because the truth matters. For years, no one heard us,\" they said\"We would have preferred to face Roger Lumbala, to look him in the eyes. But this verdict marks a first step toward reclaiming pieces of ourselves that were taken from us.\"During the trial Mr Kasereka, 41, described how his father and neighbours were tortured killed by Lumbala's men, the AP news agency reports.Mr Paluku, who is a now 50-year-old nurse, told of how the rebels robbed and injured him, killed his uncle and raped his friend's wife, the AFP news agency says.\"We hope that this will serve as a lesson to those who continue to bring grief to the people of Congo, and particularly to Ituri,\" he told the Reuters news agency.According to AP, Lumbala's legal team, which has 10 days to file an appeal, called the sentence excessive. Prosecutors had sought a life sentence.Eastern DR Congo, which is rich in minerals, has been wracked by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Several peace deals going back to the 1990s have collapsed.Over the years a number of other militia leaders, including Thomas Lubanga, Germain Katanga and Bosco Ntaganda, have been put on trial and convicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for abuses committed in the east of DR Congo.Human rights groups welcomed Monday's verdict as a milestone for further accountability in the long-running conflict there.\"This verdict is historic. For the first time, a national court has dared to confront the atrocities of the Second Congo War and show that justice can break through even after decades of impunity,\" Trial International's Daniele Perissi said in a statement.",

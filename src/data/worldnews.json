    "body": "<div><div><p>9 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Nardine Saad</span><span>BBC News, Los Angeles</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>A new law in California is aimed at stopping advertisements from pumping up the volume on streaming services.</p><p>The law, which says adverts cannot be louder than the primary video content being watched, builds on a federal one that sets the volume of ads on broadcast TV and cable stations to include streaming platforms. </p><p>Opponents, including the influential entertainment industry, had argued it would be difficult to implement because streaming services do not have the same control over ad volume as broadcasters.</p><p>California is home to the headquarters of streaming platforms Netflix and Hulu, and Amazon produces many of its Prime Video shows and movies there.</p></div><div><p>In 2010, Congress pass the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act to dial down the volume on TV and radio stations. </p><p>The law that California Governor Gavin Newsom signed on Monday forces streaming services to comply with the Obama-era federal law too.</p><p>The services were in their nascence when the CALM Act was passed but have since become the primary viewing option in many US households.</p><p>\"We heard Californians loud and clear, and what's clear is that they don't want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program,\" Newsom said upon signing the bill.</p><p>Existing federal law requires the federal regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to develop regulations that require commercials to have the same average volume as the programs they accompany, according to the bill.</p><p>In February, the FCC said it had received thousands of complaints about loud commercials over past several years - many regarding streaming services.</p><p>This law, which takes effect on and after July 1, 2026, prohibits a video streaming service that serves consumers in the state from transmitting the audio of commercial advertisements louder than the video content the people are watching.</p><p>\"This bill was inspired by baby Samantha and every exhausted parent who's finally gotten a baby to sleep, only to have a blaring streaming ad undo all that hard work,\" said State Senator Thomas Umberg, who introduced the bill.</p><p>Samantha is the daughter of Umberg's legislative director, Zach Keller, who told him about a noisy ad waking up his infant daughter while he was watching a streaming show.</p><p>However, the Motion Picture Association and the Streaming Innovation Alliance, which represent streaming services including Disney and Netflix, initially opposed the bill. </p><p>They said they do not have the ability to control volume settings on the devices on which their content is offered, unlike broadcast and cable TV providers. </p><p>Streaming ads come from several different sources and cannot necessarily or practically be controlled, the MPA's vice-president of state government affairs Melissa Patack said in June.</p><p>The bill was later amended with a legal provision that would bar individuals or private parties from suing streaming services for violating the law.</p><p>Both groups remained neutral on the amended bill as a result, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p></div>",

We are truly sorry for all that you had to endure.\"</p><p>Mr Phillips, who disappeared with his children in part due to a custody dispute, evaded capture for nearly four years, despite a nationwide search and multiple sightings.</p></div><div><p>He was killed in a shoot-out on 8 September, in which a police officer was also seriously injured. </p><p>The officer has since been discharged from hospital, local media reported.</p><p>One of his children had been with him during the shoot-out and provided information to help locate Mr Phillips' two other children later that day.</p><p>Before Mr Phillips and his children vanished, they had been living in Marokopa, a small rural town in the region of Waikato surrounded by dense bush and forested terrain.</p><p>Mr Phillips was known as an experienced hunter and bushman who knew the area he disappeared into well.</p><p>\"The vast area in which Phillips kept the children is difficult, steep terrain almost completely obscured from all angles by dense bush,\" Det Sup Ross McKay said weeks after the deadly shoot-out.</p><p>Mr Phillips and one or more of his children had been seen a handful of times during their time in the wilderness, on several occasions on CCTV while breaking into stores for supplies.</p><p>It was a store in the small town of Piopio that Mr Phillips was suspected of attempting to break into when police were called, leading to a chase and the shoot-out.</p><p>The main goal of the police during the operation had been \"locating and returning the children safely\" Det Sup McKay said. He added that they \"knew Phillips had firearms and was motivated to use them\".</p><p>Police said they could not provide further details amid ongoing investigations. </p><p>Mr Phillips' family had previously made public appeals to him to return.</p><p>In a message addressed directly to him during a television interview, his sister Rozzi said \"we're ready to help you walk through what you need to walk through\".</p><p>Mr Phillips' mother Julia also wrote him a letter - provided to New Zealand outlet Stuff - saying that everyday she hoped \"today will be the day that you all come home\".</p></div>",

The organisation said they were detained some time ago but it was not previously reported.</p><p>Security Minister Mahamadou Sana said the NGO had \"collected and passed on sensitive security information that could be detrimental to national security and the interests of Burkina Faso, to foreign powers\".</p><p>The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO), which provides safety information to aid workers, has \"categorically\" denied the allegations.</p></div><div><p>Anthony Neal,  a representative of the NGO told the BBC's Newsday programme that its Burkina Faso country director had been detained since July when the organisation was suspended. The seven others were arrested later.</p><p>\"We continue to work towards their safe and immediate release,\" he said.</p><p>The NGO was suspended on 31 July for three months by the authorities for \"collecting sensitive data without authorisation\". It has been working in the country since 2019.</p><p>On Tuesday, the security minister said that despite being banned, members of the organisation had continued to secretly collect information and hold meetings.</p><p>Mr Neal denied the claim, saying its information-collection activities had ceased on 31 July but its staff remained in Burkina Faso to deal with the detention and meet its contractual commitments.</p><p>A statement by the  organisation emphasised that the information it collects was not confidential and was meant for the safety of humanitarian workers.</p><p>It added that the Burkinabé authorities were \"fully aware\" of their work and mandate and had been co-operating with the authorities.</p><p>Mr Neal said he had tried to engage with the government to address any misunderstandings or concerns.

    "body": "<div><p>French President Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister within 48 hours, the Elysee Palace has said, fending off speculation that fresh elections could be imminent.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, outgoing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu said the possibility of dissolving parliament was beginning to fade following talks with political parties over the last two days.</p><p>\"There is a majority in parliament and that is the majority that is keen to avoid fresh elections,\" he said.</p><p>On Monday, Lecornu - a close ally of Macron - became the third French PM to leave his job in less than a year, driven out by a hung parliament deeply divided along ideological lines.</p></div><div><p>He was then asked by Macron to stay on for two days to form a consensus among parties on how to get out of the current political crisis.</p><p>In a much-awaited TV interview on Wednesday evening, Lecornu gave no indication about who the next prime minister would be, and although he said his mission was \"finished\", he also did not appear to rule himself out entirely.</p><p>He said that as well as not wanting fresh elections, most MPs also recognised the pressing need to pass a budget by the end of the year.</p><p>However, he recognised the path towards forming a government was still complicated due to the divisions within parliament and to politicians eyeing the next presidential election.</p><p>Whoever ends up in government \"will need to be completely disconnected from any presidential ambition for 2027,\" said Lecornu, a former armed forces minister.</p><p>France's political stalemate began following snap elections in July 2024. Since then no one party has had a majority, making it difficult to pass any laws or reforms including the yearly budget.</p><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt, which this year stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.</p><p>Previous prime ministers Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou were ousted in confidence votes after they presented austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu said his own draft budget would be presented next week, although it would be \"open for debate\".</p><p>\"But the debate needs to begin... parties cannot say they'll vote it down without examining it,\" he added.</p><p>Similarly, Lecornu said, one big issue that has been plaguing French politics since 2023 will need to be revisited - Macron's highly contested pension reforms. \"We have to find a way for the debate to take place,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>But some factions in parliament appear immovable from their positions.</p><p>Mathilde Panot of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) said soon after Lecornu's TV interview that the only solution was \"the resignation and departure of Emmanuel Macron\".</p><p>Meanwhile, far right National Rally's leader Marine Le Pen, who has long been calling for fresh elections, stated on Wednesday that she would vote down any new government.</p><p>It is unclear, at this stage, which political forces would support a new government.</p><p>The so-called common platform of centrists and Republicans that have run the government since last year appears to have fallen apart.</p><p>The big question now is whether over the last 48 hours Lecornu was able to persuade the Socialists, who were part of that left bloc during the elections, to prop up a government in some way.</p><p>Asked about the calls by some political factions for Macron to resign, with even Macron's own former prime minister Edouard Philippe floating the idea earlier this week, Lecornu said France needed a stable, internationally recognised figure at its helm.</p><p>\"This is not the time to change the president,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>However, Macron is appearing increasingly isolated, with even close allies beginning to distance themselves from him.</p><p>Earlier this week Gabriel Attal, widely seen as Macron's protégé, said he \"no longer understood\" Macron and called for the appointment of an independent negotiator to steer the government.</p><p>Macron has not yet spoken publicly since Lecornu's shock resignation on Monday morning. Lecornu promised the president would \"address the French people in due course,\" without specifying when that may be.</p></div>",

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has accused the Trump administration of an \"authoritarian march\" and said the state would \"use every lever at our disposal to stop this power grab\".</p><p>Sources told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that some troops could begin their assignments as early as Wednesday. </p></div><div><p>CBS also reported that trailers have been set up as temporary living quarters on the Army Reserve Training Center about 50 miles (80km) south-west of Chicago. </p><p>Fencing was also put up around the training facility late on Tuesday.</p><p>Local officials have said they have received few details on the troop assignments. </p><p>Trump argues the use of the troops is necessary to quell violence in Democratic-controlled cities, crack down on crime and support his deportation initiatives.</p><p>National Guard troops have limited power. They do not enforce the law, or make arrests, seizures, or searches - their role is instead about protecting federal officers and property.</p><p>Trump has already sent guard members into Los Angeles and Washington, DC, and has ordered them to enter Memphis and Portland. </p><p>A federal judge temporarily barred troops from deploying to Portland, however. Another judge has allowed the Chicago deployment for now. </p><p>Chicago has seen an increase in protests over immigration enforcement in the city, many of them happening outside US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities.</p><p>Last weekend, US Border Patrol personnel shot and injured a woman after a group of people rammed cars into immigration enforcement vehicles - though local media report that her lawyer has contested parts of the government's version of the events.  </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yenwklgdyo\">Life next to Portland protest angering Trump</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy9z7yg2n7o\">Why is Trump trying to deploy the National Guard to US cities?</a></li></ul><p>A hearing is scheduled for Thursday in the lawsuit filed by Illinois and Chicago - which are suing to stop National Guard troops from their state and from Texas being federalised, or brought under the control of the president.</p><p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told BBC News on Tuesday that doing so, \"literally handpicking National Guard people from another state, the state of Texas, and then sending them to the state of Illinois - this is illegal, unconstitutional, and dangerous\".</p><p>On Monday, Johnson signed an executive order banning ICE agents from operating on city-owned properties. </p><p>The deployments have posed both legal and constitutional questions, as National Guard troops are typically deployed by a state's governor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ylyd9lkkqo\">and century-old laws limit the government's use of the military for domestic matters</a>.</p><p>Trump has said that he would consider invoking an even older law, the Insurrection Act, if federal courts stopped his deployment of National Guard troops to US cities.</p><p>The 1807 act allows a US president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the country. </p><p>Asked about that in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump referenced Chicago and said that \"if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job\". </p></div>",

cutting a figure more akin to an off-duty rock star than a bank CEO - wearing an open-collar shirt and jeans, and high-fiving staff on his way to the stage.  </p><p>Opening with his take on the UK's economy, Dimon said he felt Rachel Reeves was doing a \"terrific job\", and he felt optimistic about some of the government's attempts to boost innovation and cut regulation.</p><p>However, on the broader economic picture, he felt there were increased risks US stock markets were overheated.</p><p>\"I am far more worried about that than others,\" he said.</p></div><div><p>There were a \"lot of things out there\" creating an atmosphere of uncertainty, he added, pointing to risk factors like the geopolitical environment, fiscal spending and the remilitarisation of the world. </p><p>\"All these things cause a lot of issues that we don't know how to answer,\" he said.</p><p>\"So I say the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds than what I would call normal.\" </p><p>Much of the rapid growth in the stock market in recent years has been driven by investment in AI.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Bank of England drew a comparison with the dotcom boom (and subsequent bust) of the late 1990s - and warned that the value of AI tech companies \"appear stretched\" with a rising risk of a \"sharp correction\".</p><p>\"The way I look at it is AI is real, AI in total will pay off,\" he said.</p><p>\"Just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off, but most people involved in them didn't do well.\"</p><p>He added some of the money being invested in AI would \"probably be lost\". </p></div><p></p><h2>Bullets, guns and bombs</h2><p></p><div><p>Global security has been a recent focus for the JP Morgan boss, with his letter to shareholders earlier this year warning the US would run out of missiles in seven days of a South China Sea war.</p><p>Reflecting on how the world could combat risk factors, he pointed to greater military investment. </p><p>\"People talk about stockpiling things like crypto, I always say we should be stockpiling bullets, guns and bombs.</p><p>\"The world's a much more dangerous place, and I'd rather have safety than not.\" </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp\" alt=\"BBC Business editor Simon Jack sits opposite Jamie Dimon as he interviews him near a fireplace surrounded by TV cameras\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jamie Dimon was speaking exclusively to the BBC's Simon Jack</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Another risk factor which many in the global economy believe the US could be facing is pressure placed on the independence of the Federal Reserve, America's central bank.  </p><p>On this, he said he thought central bank independence was important -

I think I'd do a good job.\"</p></div></article>",

For the third time in a year his choice of prime minister has resigned, and opinion polls suggest almost three-quarters of voters think the president should step down too.</p><p>Macron has repeatedly said he will not leave office early, and France is now waiting to find out if a new government can be formed, or if he has to dissolve parliament.</p></div><p></p><h2>How did we get here?</h2><p></p><div><p>Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu announced his resignation at the start of a day of political drama on Monday, after only 26 days in the job.</p><p>Hours later he said he had accepted Macron's request to stay on for another 48 hours - until the end of Wednesday - to hold last-ditch talks with political parties \"for the stability of the country\".</p><p>The unexpected twists were the latest in a long series of upheavals that began with Emmanuel Macron's decision to call a snap parliamentary election in June 2024. The result was a hung parliament in which Macron's centrist partners lost their majority and had to seek alliances with other parties.</p><p>The leader of one of those parties, Bruno Retailleau of the conservative Republicans, pulled out of Lecornu's government 14 hours after it was announced.</p></div><p></p><h2>It's all about France's debt</h2><p></p><div><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt and get over the ideological divisions between the centre-ground parties who could be part of a government.</p><p>Early this year public debt stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy. France's budget deficit this year is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.</p><p>Michel Barnier and François Bayrou lasted only three and nine months respectively before being ousted in confidence votes as they tried to tackle the deficit with austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu did not even make it as far as presenting a budget plan. Criticism poured in from all sides as soon as he presented his cabinet on Sunday afternoon and by Monday morning he had decided his position was untenable.</p><p>He blamed his departure on the unmovable stance of parties who, he said, \"all behave as if they had a majority\".</p><p>All the parties have an eye on the next presidential votes in 2027, and they are also gearing up for the possibility of snap parliamentary elections in case Macron dissolves parliament again.</p></div><p></p><h2>What happens now?</h2><p></p><div><p>Lecornu has been deep in discussions with party representatives and has until Wednesday evening to present a \"platform of action and stability\" to Macron.</p><p>There are four options - and none of them look good.</p></div><div><ul><li>If Lecornu manages to persuade the centre-ground parties to form some kind of government, then Macron will be able to name a new prime minister, whoever that is. Lecornu has indicated he does not wish to take on the job.  He said on Wednesday that there was a \"willingness\" among the parties to have a budget in place by 31 December and that this will clearly helped \"distance\" the threat of dissolving parliament. One option he has is to offer the job to the Socialists, if Macron is prepared to suspend hard-fought reforms that raised the pension age in France from 62 to 64. But that would cost France billions and the next government needs to pass some kind of 2026 budget to tackle its national debt, and bring down the budget deficit.</li><li>If Lecornu fails, the Elysee has indicated that Macron would \"take responsibility\". That would probably mean fresh parliamentary elections, which would spell bad news for his centrist allies and the Socialists but would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular. Elections would need to take place a maximum of 40 days after parliament is dissolved - which would mean voting in November.</li><li>Macron's presidency ends in 18 months but he is facing increasing calls to step down. He has repeatedly rejected early presidential elections, but it is not out of the question. Former Macron minister Benjamin Haddad argues that his resignation would make no sense  as the next president would just face the same problem: \"The political divide is here to stay.\"</li><li>Even without a government agreement, the parties could put aside their differences in parliament and come to a compromise on a limited budget. But French politics is not known for its culture of compromise.</li></ul></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A smiling Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella walk down the street\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>A snap election would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular</figcaption><p></p></figure><p></p><h2>Who are the key figures in this crisis?</h2><p></p><div><p>The leaders who have been calling on Macron to resign for months are on the hard right and radical left.</p><p>Marine Le Pen and her young lieutenant in the far-right National Rally, Jordan Bardella, are ready for elections and have refused Lecornu's invitation to talk.</p><p>Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) has been agitating for Macron's impeachment, although that seems unlikely. He is backed by the Greens.</p><p>Olivier Faure's centre-left Socialists were allied to the radical left during the last elections but have been talking to Lecornu on condition that he forms a left-wing government.</p><p>Then there is Gabriel Attal, who leads Macron's own centrist Renaissance party, but has said he no longer understands the president's decisions.</p><p>And on the centre-right is Bruno Retailleau, whose Republicans have been part of the so-called <i>socle commun</i> (common platform) with the centrists.</p></div><p></p><h2>Has Macron run out of road?</h2><p></p><div><p>After his third prime minister in the past year announced his resignation on Monday, Macron went for a long walk along the River Seine, his mobile phone to his ear.</p><p>A stunt for the cameras?

This includes products like milk, yogurt and cheese. </p><p>Oat milk, for instance, is called an oat drink on European shelves.</p><p>Greens and liberal lawmakers have criticised the now-approved EP text as \"useless\". </p><p>\"While the world is burning, the EPP has nothing better to do this week than to involve us all in a debate about sausages and schnitzel,\"  Anna Cavazzini of Germany's Green Party was quoted by Deutsche Welle as saying. </p><p>Environmentalists have said that the ban would be a setback for sustainability. </p><p>The proposal has also drawn criticism from key food industry voices in Germany - the largest market for plant-based products  in the EU, according to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gfieurope.org/european-plant-based-sales-data/#spain\">report by the Good Food Institute of Europe. </a></p><p>Major German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, fast food joint Burger King and sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1or1KNtCSQrP1zFD4-3xAQAWR8Tbwi0OA/view\">have pushed back against the proposal in a joint open letter</a>. </p><p>They said banning \"familiar terms\" would make it \"more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions\". </p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz - whose party is a key member of the EPP - fully backs the ban. \"A sausage is a sausage. Sausage is not vegan,\" he said recently.</p><p>The French meat industry has also strongly supported the idea. </p><p>Back in 2020, a similar proposal was on the table but it wasn't passed.</p></div>",

Gregersen, the founder of precious metals dealer and storage provider Silver Bullion, said he has seen customers numbers more than double in the last year.</p><p>Retail investors, banks and wealthy families have increasingly turned to gold, viewing it as a safeguard against global economic uncertainty, he said.</p><p>\"Gold will fall at some point, but I believe given the economic environment, it's on an upward trend for at least five years,\" Mr Gregersen said.</p><p>Gold may fall in value if there is a hike in interest rates or geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties ease, said OCBC's Mr Wong.</p><p>In April, for instance, the price of gold fell by around 6% after Trump backed off from firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said.</p><p>\"Gold is often seen as a hedge against uncertainty, but the hedge can be unwound.\"</p><p>And in 2022, gold's<b> </b>value plunged from $2,000 to $1,600 an ounce, after the US central bank raised interest rates to curb the inflation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, said UOB's Mr<b> </b>Heng.</p><p>A key risk to gold's current rally is a sudden resurgence in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates, he added.</p><p>The recent climb in gold prices reflects expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates, making gold more attractive, said Mr Wong.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump has ramped up pressure on the Fed, publicly criticising Mr Powell for not cutting rates quick enough and attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.</p><p>The president's targeting of the Fed can \"undermine confidence in the [its] ability to act as a credible, inflation-targeting central bank,\" said Mr Wong.</p><p>In such an environment, gold's role as a hedge against uncertainty \"gains renewed importance,\" he said.</p><p>The UK's central bank also raised concerns about the global tariff war and over the credibility of the Fed.</p></div><p></p><h2>AI warning</h2><p></p><div><p>While giving UK banks a broadly clean bill of health for resilience against potential shocks, the BoE's financial policy committee said the record concentration of stock markets on a handful of big tech companies was also a risk. </p><p>\"A sudden or significant change in perceptions of Federal Reserve credibility could result in a sharp re-pricing of US dollar assets, including in US sovereign debt markets, with the potential for increased volatility, risk premia, and global spillovers,\" the committee said.</p><p>The committee assesses all financial risks to the economy, and recommends whether banks should take steps to protect financial stability.</p><p>In its regular financial stability assessment, the committee identified the still soaring valuations of the world's biggest tech companies, especially those focused on AI in the US as a concern.</p><p>The committee said that on some profit measures, it was \"comparable to the peak of the dotcom bubble\", which ended in a huge crash at the turn of the millennium.</p><p>In its report, the committee said: \"On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence

Images from winter showed it reappearing and a car making use of it in January 2023.</p><p>I could think of only one group of people who could be using the path in an occupied village so close to the front line: Russian soldiers.

It's where locals went swimming in the summer, and where visitors from across the region came in the winter to go ice-fishing. One of my earliest memories is of local women singing Ukrainian folk songs as the sun was setting into the Kakhovka on a warm summer evening.</p><p>The Sea disappeared after the Kakhovka dam was destroyed in June 2023, leading to devastating floods that ruined homes and farmland.</p></div><div><p>To find out what conditions in Verkhnya Krynytsya are like now, I tried reaching out to locals.</p><p>Predictably, obtaining answers was very difficult.</p><p>Many have left, and those who are still in the village - as is the case in the other occupied parts of Ukraine - are afraid of speaking to the media. Frontline locations are particularly lawless places, where retribution from Russian forces can be swift and brutal.</p><p>Social media groups about Verkhnya Krynytsya went silent after it was occupied, and the questions I posted there were left unanswered.</p><p>Asking someone to go and have a look at my house was out of the question. What used to be a peaceful, sleepy village has turned into a zone of fear.</p><p>The danger in Verkhnya Krynytsya also comes from the sky. The village's proximity to the front line means it is a dangerous location, exposed to frequent aerial attacks from the Ukrainians.</p><p>One acquaintance told me that locals preferred to stay indoors for fear of being hit by drones. \"It's very dangerous there,\" I was told. \"They are active, and they can target you, your house or your car. Our village has changed a lot, Vitaly.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>New residents</h2><p></p><div><p>So, given the danger and devastation caused to Verkhnya Krynytsya by the war, who could have possibly made the track marks leading to and from my old home?</p><p>It is highly unlikely anyone would choose to move to the village now - with the exception of Russian soldiers.</p><p>Many of them moved into vacant houses after capturing Verkhnya Krynytsya. In June 2022 authorities in Zaporizhzhia said they had information that Russian troops were staying in the village. This is when satellite images first show signs of the path at my old home.</p><p>To check if I was right in assuming that Russian soldiers had likely moved into my old house, I approached the Ukrainian 128th Detached Heavy Mechanised Brigade, which is involved in operations in the area.</p><p>\"You're not wrong. It's extremely likely,\" its spokesman Oleksandr Kurbatov told me.</p><p>As locals have been fleeing frontline areas, they are being replaced with Russian military, he said.</p><p>\"If there are not enough empty houses, demand is running high. Of course, it's usually military personnel from the occupation army,\" he told me.</p><p>Because nobody in the village was willing to take the risk of having a look at my house, I asked my BBC Verify colleague Richard Irvine-Brown to obtain and analyse recent satellite images.

After Mr Comey's lawyer requested a speedy trial, the judge set a date of 5 January.</p></div><div><p>Both the prosecution and defence expected the trial to last just two or three days.</p><p>In court on Wednesday, Mr Comey's lawyer Patrick Fitzgerald told the judge that they planned to file several motions to dismiss the case before a trial, arguing the prosecution was vindictive and that a US attorney had been unlawfully appointed to take over the case.</p><p>Mr Comey was fired as FBI director in 2017, about four months into Trump's first term as president. At the time, Mr Comey had been leading an investigation into Russian election interference and whether there were any links between Moscow and Trump's campaign.</p><p>The federal government alleges Mr Comey lied to Congress during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September 2020, when he was being questioned about both the Russia election probe and an investigation into Trump's 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.</p><p>He told the hearing that he had not authorised someone at the FBI to leak information about the investigations - a statement the Justice Department alleges was untrue and therefore misleading.</p><p>Prosecutors also accuse Mr Comey of \"corruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct and impede\" the panel by making false statements to it.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj07ndrnr34o\">What is Comey accused of?</a></li></ul><p>Mr Comey's case was originally overseen by Erik Siebert, a Virginia prosecutor who resigned under pressure from Trump after his investigation into another political adversary - New York Attorney General Letitia James - failed to bring criminal charges. </p><p>Trump then appointed Lindsey Halligan to replace him, who secured a grand jury indictment against Mr Comey less than a week into the job. Prosecutors before her had declined to take on the case due to a lack of evidence.</p><p>Mr Comey appeared in good spirits as he entered the courtroom on Wednesday, chatting with his attorneys and making jokes. He was joined by his wife, Patrice Failor, and daughter Maureen Comey, a federal prosecutor whom the Trump administration recently fired.</p><p>After listening to the judge read his rights and the two counts against him in court on Wednesday, Mr Comey was asked if he understood the charges.</p><p>\"I do, your honour. Thank you very much,\" he told the court.</p><p>US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff said the two charges each carry a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to a $200,000 (£149,442).</p><p>Ms Halligan's hasty ascent to the role of top federal prosecutor in Virginia's eastern district in September was reflected in Wednesday's proceedings, when defence lawyers complained they did not have access to classified documents that prosecutors intended to submit as evidence. </p><p>\"We feel the cart has been put before the horse,\" Mr Fitzgerald said.</p><p>Judge Nachmanoff warned the government: \"I will not slow this case down because the government does not promptly turn over information.\"</p><p>During his tenure as FBI director, Mr Comey sparked a backlash from Democrats when he announced the investigation into Clinton's emails just days before the 2016 presidential election. Charges against Clinton were never brought, leading to criticism from Republicans as well. </p><p>Since leaving government, Mr Comey has been an ardent critic of the Trump administration.</p><p>In a video Mr Comey posted to his Instagram after he was indicted, he said he was innocent and accused Trump of acting like a \"tyrant\".</p><p>\"My family and I have know for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump,\" he said. \"We will not live on our knees.\"</p><p>\"I'm innocent,\" he added. \"So let's have a trial.\"</p><p>The charges against Mr Comey came after Trump posted on social media demanding his attorney general, Pam Bondi, prosecute Mr Comey and others.</p></div>",

    "body": "The BBC said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the well-being of one its journalists who has been unable to leave Vietnam for several months.The Vietnamese national travelled to the country to visit family and renew their passport, but the document and their ID card have been withheld and they have been subjected to \"multiple days of questioning\", the corporation said in a statement.The BBC is urging Vietnamese authorities to allow the journalist to leave immediately and return to work by providing the renewed passport.It comes as general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, To Lam, arrived in the UK on Tuesday, for a visit during which he is expected to meet Sir Keir Starmer.A Foreign Office spokesperson said the UK's \"position and track record defending media freedom is clear\".They added: \"We remain concerned by reported harassment of NGOs, journalists, and rights activists and communities in Vietnam and continue to raise these concerns directly with our Vietnamese counterpart.\"Vietnam is a one-party Communist state and has been one of south-east Asia's fastest-growing economies.But alongside its economic growth, the country has high levels of political censorship and a poor record on human rights.The Communist Party has a strong grip on the media in Vietnam. Media outlets and journalists risk sanctions and arrest for broaching sensitive topics and for criticising the government, while online content deemed to threaten Communist rule is blocked.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondent in LeidenROBIN UTRECHT/ANP/AFPRob Jetten, 38, led a highly polished campaign and outperformed his rivals in TV debatesThe centrist liberals under Rob Jetten are heading for a dramatic victory, according to the main exit poll, two years after his party languished in fifth place in the last vote.Jetten staged a remarkable campaign in recent weeks, and the Ipsos I&O exit poll suggests his D66 liberals have won 27 seats, two more than anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders who won the last election.Although the final result is too close to call, Wilders conceded victory and Jetten told supporters \"millions of Dutch people have turned a page; they've said goodbye to a politics of negativity\".Three other parties are close behind, including the conservative liberals, the left-wing GreenLeft-Labour party and the Christian Democrats.Wilders led the polls throughout the election campaign, but after he pulled the plug on his own coalition in June in a row over asylum and migration, all the mainstream leaders made clear they did not wish to work with him again.Jetten's party, meanwhile, staged a highly successful campaign. Only a few weeks ago, the polls put D66 on just 12 seats, but the photogenic, 38-year-old leader capitalised on polished performances in a succession of TV debates and interviews. The fact that he also competed in a TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the weeks leading to the vote only added to his public profile.Jetten was careful not to claim victory on Wednesday night, because the margin of error in the exit poll meant nothing was certain.However, the conservative liberal VVD of Dilan Yesilgöz was also heading for a successful night in third place and a likely place in a future Jetten-led coalition.SEM VAN DER WAL/ANP/AFPDilan Yesilgöz (R) also had a good election after good performances in TV debatesGoing into Wednesday's election, voters knew the result would be on a knife-edge, as five parties were in the running to win. Wilders' PVV Freedom Party had won 37 seats in November 2023, but this time the electorate were clearly put off by the realisation that he could not form another coalition.It took seven months for Wilders to reach a deal with coalition partners in 2024, only to bring down the government 11 months later. Rob Jetten made clear he was looking for a broad-based coalition that was both \"stable and ambitious\", and he pointed out it was unprecedented for the winning party to score fewer than 30 seats in parliament.He named the Labour(PvdA)-GreenLeft of former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans as one potential coalition partner, along with Yesilgöz's conservative liberals and a revitalised Christian Democrat CDA.The exit poll spelt bad news for Timmermans, whose left-wing party had long been second in the polls and is now set to come fourth. \"Better times lie ahead,\" he promised his supporters late on Wednesday. \"Of course I'm hugely disappointed,\" he added, and announced he was stepping down and taking responsibility for the result.Timmermans and Wilders are both in their early 60s and entered politics at the same time, and there is now a sense that Dutch voters are prepared to try something new.Wilders, however, said he was going nowhere: \"You won't be rid of me until I'm 80.\" He remained bullish about his Freedom Party's performance: \"I would naturally rather have seen more seats... but we have still had our second best result.\"Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam said Wilders' party had lost the support of many of its moderate voters to other parties as well as many on the more radical side.But, he said, \"the losses could have been worse\", given that Wilders had himself broken up the last coalition and had campaigned less actively than his rivals.Anna Holligan/BBCSupporters of Jetten's centrist liberals were overjoyed with the surprise resultThere was palpable excitement as D66 supporters gathered for the results at a music venue in Leiden, a university city between Amsterdam and The Hague. A second exit poll, half an hour after voting ended at 21:30 (20:30 GMT) confirmed the initial projection and the words \"yes, we can\" were voiced repeatedly as a kind of party mantra in the hall.Taking to the stage, the man now tipped to be the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch history told supporters \"we did it - the best result D66 has ever achieved\".\"We also know that millions of Dutch people voted for other parties, and I also feel a very heavy responsibility for [all of them],\" said Rob Jetten. \"We will do all we can in the coming years to show all the Dutch people that politics and government can be there for them again so they can think big again and act big again so the Netherlands can move forward.\"This election was partly fought on migration and overcrowded asylum centres, but the biggest issue for voters was the chronic housing shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Jetten's party has said it will build 10 cities as part of its plan to tackle the crisis.\"It was a campaign of optimism, it shows the Dutch are tired of two years of standstill, we recognise big challenges and we want progress on those,\" said D66 supporter Eline. \"It shows the Dutch are craving a prime minister who is able to unite the country and tackle the major challenges our country and the world are facing.\"One potential coalition partner for the liberals is the Christian Democrats, who only two years ago looked down and out with just a handful of seats. Now they are projected to win 19. \"What a fantastic result - two years ago we could not have dared to dream of this,\" CDA leader Henri Bontenbal told supporters as they chanted his name.",

    "body": "Two men arrested in connection with the Louvre theft two weeks ago have \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the brazen heist, according to officials.The pair in custody are suspected of being the two who used power tools to enter the museum's Apollon gallery and steal some of the French crown jewels.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that the jewels had not been recovered yet, and the gang involved could be bigger than the four people caught on CCTV.The two men, both in their thirties, have criminal records and were identified by DNA found during investigations, Beccuau said.One of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but Beccuau said the other man had not been planning to leave France, despite earlier media reports.There was no evidence currently to suggest the theft was an inside job confirming no accomplices worked at the museum, she added.But Beccuau said she was not ruling out the possibility that this involved more than the four suspects caught on CCTV, including the people expecting to receive the stolen jewels.\"I want to remain hopeful that [the jewels] will be found and they can be brought back to the Louvre, and more broadly to the nation\", she said.A crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, was dropped by the thieves as they fled. Damage to the crown is still being assessed, Beccuau added.On Sunday when the arrests were made, the prosecutor criticised the \"premature disclosure\" of information related to the case, adding that it hindered efforts to recover the jewels and find the thieves.On the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30 (08:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Beccuau said at Wednesday's conference.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.She said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars and heading east.Nobody had been threatened during the raid, she told reporters.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.",

    "body": "13 hours agoIan Aikman and Elettra NeysmithMessages in a bottle written by two Australian soldiers in 1916 have been found more than a century later on the country's south-western coast.The cheerful notes were penned just a few days into their voyage to join the battlefields of France during World War One. One of the soldiers, Pte Malcolm Neville, told his mother that the food on board was \"real good\" and that they were \"as happy as Larry\". Months later, he was killed in action at the age of 28. The other soldier, 37-year-old Pte William Harley, survived the war and returned home.The letters have been passed on to their descendants, who have been stunned by the discovery.The bottle was found earlier this month on the remote Wharton Beach, near Esperance in Western Australia, by local resident Deb Brown and her family.She was visiting the beach with her husband and daughter on one of their regular quad bike trips to clear up litter, when they spotted a thick glass bottle in the sand, she said on Tuesday.\"We do a lot of cleaning up on our beaches and so would never go past a piece of rubbish. So this little bottle was lying there waiting to be picked up,\" Ms Brown told the Associated Press news agency.Though the paper was wet, both letters were still legible, so Ms Brown began tracking down the soldiers' families in order to pass them on.Ms Brown located Pte Neville's great-nephew, Herbie Neville, by searching for the soldier's name and the town he was from online, as his mother's address was included in the note.Mr Neville told ABC News the experience had been \"unbelievable\" for his family, especially for Marian Davies - Pte Neville's niece - who remembers her uncle leaving to go to war and never returning.The second letter, written by Pte William Harley, was addressed simply to whoever found the bottle. His mother had died years earlier.Pte Harley's granddaughter, Ann Turner, told ABC she and the soldier's four other surviving grandchildren were \"absolutely stunned\" by the message.\"It really does feel like a miracle and we do very much feel like our grandfather has reached out for us from the grave,\" she said.\"I feel very emotional when I see that the other young man had a mother to write to, and that message in the bottle was to his mother, whereas our grandfather long ago had lost his mother so he just writes it to the finder of the bottle.\"The bottle was thrown overboard \"somewhere in the Bight\", Pte Harley's letter said, referring to the Great Australian Bight off the country's southern coast.An oceanography professor told ABC it may only have been in the water for a few weeks before it landed at Wharton Beach, where it may have remained buried for 100 years.",

    "description": "The French parliament has ratified an amendment to add consent to the legal definition of sexual assault and rape law.Previously, rape or sexual abuse",
    "body": "The French parliament has ratified an amendment to add consent to the legal definition of sexual assault and rape law.Previously, rape or sexual abuse in France had been defined as \"any form of sexual penetration committed with the use of violence, coercion, threat or surprise\".Now, the law will say that all sexual acts done to another without consent constitute rape.The change is the result of a cross-party, years-long debate which gained renewed urgency after last year's Pelicot rape trial, in which 50 men were found guilty of raping Gisèle Pelicot while she had been drugged unconscious by her husband Dominique.The defence of many of the accused hinged on the fact they could not be guilty of rape because they were unaware Ms Pelicot was not in a position to give her consent.Some defence lawyers in the Pelicot case had therefore argued that there could be no crime without the intention to commit it.The new bill will make this argument more tenuous, as it says that consent must be \"free and informed, specific, prior and revocable\",The law now says consent will have to be evaluated according to the circumstances, noting that it cannot be inferred from \"silence or lack of reaction\".\"There is no consent if the sexual act is committed through violence, coercion, threat or surprise, whatever their nature,\" it states.The two MPs who drafted the amendment - the Greens' Marie-Charlotte Garin and centrist Véronique Riotton - said a \"historic victory\" had been achieved and hailed \"a major step forward in the fight against sexual violence\".Some critics of the amendment had argued it would result in sexual relations turning into \"contracts\". Others were concerned that the changes could force victims of rape to prove they had not consented.But France's highest administrative court, the Council of State (Conseil d'État) said in March that it was backing the amendment, saying that it would \"clearly express... that sexual assaults infringe upon the fundamental principle of everyone's personal and sexual freedom\".An initial version was adopted by the National Assembly in April. Its progression was delayed by France's current political turmoil, but on Wednesday the Senate definitively adopted the bill, with 327 votes in favour and 15 abstentions. It then went back to parliament, which gave it final approval.Last year Greens senator Mélanie Vogel argued that while society had \"already accepted the fact that the difference between sex and rape is consent\" but that criminal law had not kept up.\"This is a historic step forward, following in the footsteps of several other European countries,\" Lola Schulmann, advocacy officer at Amnesty International France, told AFP on Wednesday.Sweden, Germany and Spain are among the European countries that already have consent-based rape laws.",

    "body": "Sudan's military government has ordered two senior officials at the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) to leave the country amid widespread famine sparked by a gruelling civil war that erupted in April 2023.The WFP said directors of its Sudan operation were declared \"personae non grata\" and told to go within 72 hours, without explanation.The decision comes days after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), captured the key city of el-Fasher in Darfur from the military after an 18-month siege, which included a food blockade.The WFP said the expulsions came a \"pivotal time\" as humanitarian needs in Sudan had \"never been greater with more than 24 million people facing acute food insecurity\".Although the military government has not given a reason for the expulsions, it has previously accused aid groups of breaking local laws and releasing misleading reports on famine conditions.The government said the expulsion will not affect the country's cooperation with the WFP, state news agency Suna reported.The WFP says it is engaging with Sudanese authorities to resolve the matter.A simple guide to what is happening in SudanA pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zoneTwo-and-a-half years of fighting between the army and the RSF escalated on Sunday, when the RSF seized el-Fasher in the western region of Darfur.There are now fears for the fate of the estimated 250,000 people in the city, many from non-Arab communities. Reports of atrocities, including mass-killings, have been mounting since the city fell.\"The situation in el-Fasher is extremely dire and there are violations taking place on the roads, including looting and shooting, with no distinction made between young or old,\" one man who managed to escape el-Fasher told the BBC Arabic's Sudan Lifeline programme.\"We managed to reach Tawila, where humanitarian organisations are present. We are grateful that we arrived, even though we have been sleeping on the roads.\"Tawila is a town about 60km (37 miles) west of el-Fasher and already hosts around 800,000 people - many of whom escaped from the vast Zamzam camp near el-Fasher when it was attacked by the RSF in April.Since the conflict erupted, RSF fighters and allied Arab militia in Darfur have been accused of targeting people from non-Arab ethnic groups - allegations the RSF denies.On Tuesday, the el-Fasher Resistance Committee, a group of local activists, accused the RSF of executing wounded people receiving treatment at the city's Saudi Hospital.Researchers at Yale University supported this allegation, saying satellite images appear to show \"clusters\" of bodies within the hospital grounds.International bodies such as the European Union and African Union have expressed alarm, while locals say the current situation is reminiscent of the region's darkest days.Darfur experienced one of the world's gravest humanitarian disasters from 2003 to 2020.The Janjaweed, a militia who were accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing during this time, morphed into what is now the RSF.Sudanese-American poet Emtithal Mahmoud, who has family in el-Fasher and lost relatives in the previous Darfur conflict, said she felt a \"genocide\" was occurring once again as seen from social media footage being posted by the RSF.\"The only difference… is that now it's live streamed and video taped and sent around because the RSF understands that they can act with impunity,\" Ms Mahmoud told the BBC.The RSF denies targeting civilians.

    "body": "Romania's defence ministry has said the US intends to reduce some of its troops stationed on Nato's eastern flank.Between 900 and 1,000 American troops will remain in Romania, Bucharest said - down from 1,700. The ministry said the decision was expected and that the \"resizing\" of US forces was a result of the new priorities of the Trump presidential administration.The Pentagon said the decision did not constitute a \"withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to Nato and Article 5\". Article 5 holds that Nato members will come to the defence of an ally which comes under attack, and has long been seen as the main deterrent against potential Russian aggression.Defence Minister Ionut Mosteanu stated that his US counterpart Pete Hegseth had recently conveyed to the Europeans that they needed to pay more attention to their own defence and that the US was shifting its attention towards the Indo-Pacific region.One US brigade at the Mihai Kogalniceanu airbase - set to be Nato's largest in Europe - would be rotated out and not replaced, Mosteanu said.The brigade has \"elements\" in Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, Mosteanu said, although it was unclear whether US troops were going to be pulled out of these countries too.Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Wednesday that Warsaw had \"no information\" about a possible reduction of US troops on its territory. The presence of US troops at Romania's Deveselu and Campia Turzii bases would remain unchanged, Ionut Mosteanu added.Since taking office in January US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his wish to shift the focus of US military commitment from Europe to the Indo-Pacific region, and has repeatedly urged European Nato members to take more responsibility for the continent's defence.But the announcement of the US troop withdrawal from Romania will be concerning for Eastern European countries, many of which feel they have reason to fear a Russian attack in the future.Shortly after the announcement from Bucharest, a Nato official stressed that Washington's commitment to the Nato alliance remained \"clear\" and adjustments were \"not unusual\".\"Even with this adjustment, the US force posture in Europe remains larger than it has been for many years, with many more US forces on the continent than before 2022,\" the official said in a statement.The Pentagon also stressed that the US maintained a \"robust presence\" throughout Europe as well as \"the ability to array forces and capabilities to meet objectives... including President Trump's commitment to defend Nato allies\".The US has more than 100,000 military personnel deployed in Europe, according to figures from late last year.Last month Nato announced the creation of a mission dubbed Eastern Sentry, which it said would enhance the alliance's vigilance along the entire eastern flank. The decision came after a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace, in the most serious incident of its kind since the war began in February 2022. Days later,  Romania reported that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, and Estonia said Russian warplanes had violated its airspace too.",

    "body": "14 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe co-founder of ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's says that its parent company Unilever blocked it from launching an ice cream flavour that expressed \"solidarity with Palestine\".Ben Cohen announced that he will independently create the new flavour as part of a personal series highlighting causes the company has been barred from addressing publicly.Ben & Jerry's is known for its activism on social issues and has consistently spoken out on political, environmental and humanitarian matters - including the Israel-Gaza conflict.A spokesperson for the Magnum Ice Cream Company, Unilever's ice cream arm, said it had determined that \"now is not the right time to invest in developing this product\". Mr Cohen's statement deepens the long-drawn dispute between the world-famous ice cream maker and Unilever, the British packaged goods giant which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000.The co-founders said Unilever and Magnum, which is in the process of being spun off from its parent company, had unlawfully blocked their company from \"honouring its social mission\".But Magnum said: \"The independent members of Ben & Jerry's Board are not, and have never been, responsible for the Ben & Jerry's commercial strategy and execution.\"It said the company would continue to focus on \"ongoing, impactful campaigns close to its communities\", including campaigning for improved conditions in refugee accommodation in the UK, and freedom of speech rights in the United States.  Mr Cohen said in an Instagram video on Tuesday that he is creating a new watermelon-flavoured sorbet, calling for ideas for the product's name and what ingredients should be added.The watermelon has become a symbol for solidarity with Palestinians due to its colours, which are similar to those of the Palestinian flag – red, green, black and white. The American entrepreneur said Ben & Jerry's were prevented by Unilever from creating the dessert.\"I'm doing what they couldn't,\" Mr Cohen says from his set in a kitchen. \"I'm making a watermelon-flavoured ice cream that calls for permanent peace in Palestine and calls for repairing the damage that was done there.\"In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel. Its Israeli operation was sold by Unilever to a local licensee, allowing its ice cream to continue being sold in the occupied West Bank.The dessert series will be developed under Ben's Best, Mr Cohen's activist ice cream brand, he said in a statement to the press. The flavour is being produced independently of Ben & Jerry's, the statement said.Ben's Best was first setup in 2016 to support former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with the flavour \"Bernie's Back\". Mr Cohen said he will develop other ice cream flavours that speak to the issues Ben & Jerry's was silenced from addressing publicly by Unilever.In September, co-founder Jerry Greenfield stepped down from Ben & Jerry's after decades at the company, citing concerns that its independence had been compromised following Unilever's decision to curb its social activism.At the time, Ben Cohen said that \"Jerry has a really big heart and this conflict with Unilever was breaking it.\"\"My heart leads me to continue to work inside the company to advocate for its independence so that it can actualise the social mission, the values that it was founded on and has maintained for over 40 years,\" he told the BBC's PM programme.",

    "body": "Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has said the US revoked his visa and banned him from the country. The 91-year-old author, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, said the US consulate asked him to bring in his passport so his visa could be cancelled in person as new unspecified information had come to light.Soyinka called the invitation a \"rather curious love letter from an embassy\" in a news conference held on Tuesday and told organisations hoping to invite him to the US \"not to waste their time\".The US embassy in Nigeria has said it cannot comment on individual cases.The Nobel laureate has previously held permanent residency in the US but renounced it in 2016, tearing up his green card in protest of President Donald Trump's election.The green card is a permanent residence permit for the US - prized by many African immigrants to the US.Soyinka affirmed on Tuesday that he no longer had his green card – and jokingly added that it had \"fallen between the fingers of a pair of scissors and it got cut into a couple of pieces\". The famed author has had regular teaching engagements at US universities for the past 30 years.\"I have no visa. I am banned,\" he said on Tuesday.Soyinka has long been critical of the Trump administration's radical stance on immigration and linked the visa revocation to his outspoken criticism.He said his recent comparison of Trump to Uganda's dictator - \"Idi Amin in white face\" - may have contributed to the current situation.\"When I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment,\" Soyinka said, \"he's been behaving like a dictator.\" Idi Amin was a Ugandan military officer and dictator who ruled the country from 1971 to 1979, infamous for his brutal regime and widespread human rights abuses.When asked if he would consider going back to the US, Soyinka said: \"How old am I?\"In July, the US State Department announced sweeping changes to its non-immigrant visa policy for citizens of Nigeria and several other African countries.According to the policy, nearly all non-immigrant and non-diplomatic visas issued to Nigerians and nationals of Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ghana would now be single-entry and valid for only three months, rolling back the up to five-year, multiple-entry visas they had enjoyed previously.",

    "body": "7 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesLizard Island is about 250km (155 miles) north of CairnsAn 80-year-old Australian woman has been found dead on a Great Barrier Reef island after being left behind by the cruise ship she was travelling on.The woman had been hiking on Lizard Island, 250km (155 miles) north of Cairns, with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer cruise ship on Saturday but is believed to have broken off from the group to have a rest.The ship left the island around sunset but returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing. A major search operation found her body on Sunday morning. No details have been released.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said it was investigating and would meet the ship's crew later this week.It is understood the woman, who has not been named, was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, with tickets costing in the tens of thousands of dollars for the journey.She had joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, before she decided she needed to rest, according to the Courier Mail newspaper.But she did not make it back to the ship, which then departed without her.Incidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze told the BBC.\"Sneaking ashore or [back] onboard just isn't an option,\" she said.Cruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening. This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off\", Ms Mallinson added.Traci Ayris was sailing near the island last weekend and told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that she saw a helicopter using a spotlight to search a walking trail on the island at around midnight on Saturday. She said about seven people with torches went to the island to search but it was called off at around 03:00 on Sunday (18:00 GMT Saturday) with a helicopter returning on Sunday morning when the body was apparently found.\"We knew she was dead because they called everyone back from the search immediately,\" she told ABC.\"And no-one went to the spot that the chopper was hovering over until later that day when the police arrived.\"A spokesperson for Amsa said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 on Saturday by the ship's captain.The authority said it would work with other relevant agencies to investigate the case and that it takes the safety of passengers and crew onboard commercial vessels seriously.Ms Ayris also said the incident was clearly distressing for crew and passengers.\"It was very sad in this paradise to have this tragedy occur. It should have been a happy time for that lovely lady.\"A report into the \"sudden and non-suspicious death\" of the woman will be prepared for the coroner, Queensland police said.Coral ExpeditionsThe incident happened on the first stop of a 60-day trip around AustraliaCoral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield said staff had contacted the woman's family and were offering support over the \"tragic death\".\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,\" Mr Fifield said.\"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is under way,\" he added.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.The vessel has continued its voyage to Darwin.Additional reporting by Tom McArthur",

    "body": "8 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterFootage shows gunfire and drones in Rio raidsThe number of people known to have been killed in a deadly police raid in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday has risen to 132, officials say.This is more than double the figure cited after the police operation in the favelas (poor neighbourhoods) of Alemão and Penha, in the north of Rio de Janeiro, on Tuesday.The public defender's office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, made the new death toll public after grieving residents lay dozens of bodies in a square  early on Wednesday.The police raid was the deadliest in the city, where authorities have for decades tried to contain the gangs which control many of its poorer neighbourhoods.ANTONIO LACERDA/EPA/ShutterstockPolice said that among those detained were key members of the Red Command gangAsked about the figure given by the public defender's office, Rio state Governor Cláudio Castro said that forensic work was still under way and that until it had concluded, the official figure which he had been given was of 58 dead, although it was \"certain to change\".Among those expressing shock about the death toll was Brazil's President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. According to Brazil's justice minister, Lula was \"astonished\" and also expressed his surprise that the federal government had not been informed beforehand. Even before the number of dead had more than doubled, the United Nations Human Rights office had said it was \"horrified\" by the police operation.Early on Wednesday, residents took the bodies of those killed into a square in Penha, where they placed them next to each other in a long line to show the deadly nature of the raid.According to Brazilian media, estimates varied between at least 50 and more than 70 bodies. Many of the bodies had reportedly been retrieved from a nearby hillside, where police said most of the deadly clashes had unfolded. Challenged by journalists about earlier remarks he had made describing those killed as \"criminals\", Governor Castro replied: \"To be quite honest with you, the conflict wasn't in a built-up area, it was all in the woods. So I don't believe anyone was just strolling in the woods on a day of conflict. And that's why we can easily classify them.\"REUTERS/Aline MassucaResidents were distraught after the raid, in which at least 64 people were killedResidents described the scenes unfolding on Tuesday as \"war-like\", with shoot-outs between officers and armed men - with buses set on fire to create barricades.According to the police, gang members also used drones to drop explosives on the officers as they fanned out through the neighbourhoods, which are strongholds of the Red Command.\"This is how the Rio police are treated by criminals: with bombs dropped by drones. This is the scale of the challenge we face. This is not ordinary crime, but narco-terrorism,\" Governor Castro, said. Governor Castro said that the raid had been two months in the planning and was based on a thorough investigation. Among those arrested is a man accused of being a leading drug dealer for the Red Command. The governor also posted photos on social media of the four police officers who were killed in the operation.He praised the officers killed on what he called \"a historic day\" in which he said they \"confronted organised crime\".Rafael Soares, a Brazilian journalist covering crime in Rio, told BBC News Brasil that the Red Command had been on the offensive in Rio in recent years, reclaiming territory it had lost to its rivals, First Capital Command (PCC).Soares added that the police operation was part of Governor Castro's efforts to leave his mark and deal a decisive blow to crime in the city ahead of elections next year. The police raid also comes just days before the city is due to host the C40 World Mayors Summit - a meeting of nearly 100 mayors from the world's leading cities - and the Earthshot Prize - the environmental award which will be handed out by Prince William on 5 November.  Huge police raids are not unusual in Rio, but the number of fatalities in Tuesday's operation is.According to  Soares, police operations in which more than 20 people are killed are \"very rare\" across Brazil and those that do occur, have mainly happened in Rio. Rio de Janeiro's Minister for Public Security, Victor Santos, said that 280,000 people lived in the areas where the raids took place. Police footage showed heavily-armed officers patrolling the narrow, steep lanes of the densely populated hillside favelas.\"This is a war we are seeing in Rio de Janeiro. Decades of inaction by all the institutions - municipal, state and federal - have allowed crime to expand in our territory,\" Santos said.With additional reporting by BBC News Brazil's Marina Rossi and Mariana Alvim in São Paulo.",

    "body": "12 hours agoKoh Ewe,Singapore and Kathryn Armstrong,LondonGetty ImagesThe meeting comes as both countries are still trying to reach a trade dealThe US and South Korea have reached a broad trade deal, both countries have said following talks between their leaders. South Korea's presidential aide, Kim Yong-beom, said the two sides will reduce reciprocal tariffs from 25% to 15%, as was agreed earlier this year. South Korea will also invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding, Kim said. US President Donald Trump, who is currently on a week-long trip in Asia, said the deal was \"pretty much finalised\" at a dinner following the discussions, which lasted almost two hours. He did not give further details. \"We had a tremendous meeting today with South Korea\", Trump said of his discussions with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, adding that \"a lot was determined\".\"We discussed some other things to do with national security et cetera. And I think we came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"Both sides had played down the prospect of a breakthrough ahead of Wednesday's talks - disappointing many in South Korea's electronics, chip and auto industries, which had been hoping for some clarity amidst the tariff chaos. Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which Lee managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn in the US and buy $100bn worth of liquified natural gas.But the White House later increase its demands as part of the trade talks, with Trump pushing for cash investments in the US.Both countries have historically been key allies - but tensions spiked after hundreds of South Koreans were detained in an immigration raid in the US last month.Caught in the middle, South Korea hosts rival superpowersTrump will next meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in on Thursday on the sidelines of a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) which is taking place in Gyeongju.China's foreign ministry has confirmed the meeting, which will take place in the city of Busan on Thursday, a short flight away from Gyeongju. The US president said on Wednesday that he was \"looking forward\" to the meeting.\"We've been talking a lot over the last month and I think we're going to have something that's gonna be very, very satisfactory to China and to us.\"This will be the two leaders' first face to face meeting since Trump assumed office in 2025 and imposed tariffs on every country in the world.Addressing a group of CEOs in Gyeongju on Wednesday, Trump said that he believes the US is \"going to have a deal\" with China and it will be \"a good deal for both\".He also praised the Apec countries for making the global trading system, which he said had been \"broken\" and \"in urgent need of reform\", fairer.\"Economic security is national security,\" Trump says. \"That's for South Korea, that's for any country.\"Golden crowns and grand ordersAhead of Wednesday's talks with President Lee, Trump had been greeted by an honour guard and gifts that included a golden crown. \"I'd like to wear it right now,\" Trump had said of the crown. He also received the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decoration.He's the first US president to receive the award, which was given \"in recognition of his contribution to peace on the Korean Peninsula\", the South Korean presidential office said.Both leaders took part in a working lunch - which was followed by a private meeting in the afternoon. ReutersThe US president was gifted a golden crown and the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decorationTrump's arrival in South Korea had been preceded by North Korea test-firing surface-to-air cruise missiles.The US president had expressed interest in meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but noted on Wednesday that his team had been unable to arrange this during his trip.Noting the long-standing tensions between North and South Korea, Trump said \"we will see what we can do to get that all straightened out\".And outside the summit venue where both leaders were meeting, a small anti-Trump group of protesters gathered on Wednesday afternoon, with some shouting anti-Trump slogans. Police could be seen forcibly dispersing the crowd and arresting some people.However, hundreds more attended a pro-Trump rally - including those who shouted anti-Chinese rhetoric  - that also took place close to the summit venue. Anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea has also grown steadily in recent years. Chinese interference became a common trope in conspiracy theories about former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol.BBC/Leehyun ChoiDozens of people attended a protest outside the Gyeongju National Museum on WednesdayDuring his trip to Japan on Tuesday, the US president signed an agreement on rare earth minerals with Tokyo, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations. This reiterated the commitment of the two countries to implement deals struck earlier, including the 15% tariff deal negotiated earlier this year.Prior to that, he attended a gathering of South East Asian leaders, known as Asean, in Malaysia. There he presided over a \"peace deal\" between Thailand and Cambodia, whose longstanding border dispute erupted into open conflict in July.With additional reporting by Laura Bicker, China Correspondent and Suranjana Tewari, Asia Business Correspondent",

    "body": "2 days agoCherylann Mollan, BBC News and Vishnukant Tiwari, BBC HindiBhopal, Madhya PradeshBBCAarish says he's worried about missing work after losing vision in his left eyeAarish, 15, sits on a hospital bed in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. A pair of dark glasses hides a painful injury in his left eye.His cornea was damaged a week ago when an improvised firecracker device that he bought to celebrate the Diwali festival exploded near his face, causing him to lose vision in one eye. He has undergone emergency surgery and his doctor says only time will tell how much sight he can regain.The teenager, who doesn't go to school, says he's most worried about missing work - his father works as a gardener and Aarish repairs televisions to supplement the family income. Child labour is illegal in India, but millions of children work. Indian law allows children above 14 years to work in some industries which are seen as non-hazardous.Aarish is among hundreds of children and young adults from at least five states across northern India who have suffered serious eye injuries from using the same kind of device - called \"carbide guns\" - during Diwali.The \"carbide gun\", a rudimentary device, using calcium carbide in a plastic pipe, gives dramatic results  - a loud blast that sounds like a gunshot, accompanied by fiery sparks. But the explosion is unpredictable and often delayed - officials told the BBC that many of the injuries occurred when children peeped inside the pipe to check just as the blast happened.The sale and purchase of calcium carbide is regulated in India, but farmers and shopkeepers often use it to artificially ripen fruit. Police officials also say the crude guns are sometimes used to scare away animals from fields.But many in India had not heard of these guns until last week, when a spate of injuries was reported after Diwali. Officials said these devices began flooding local markets in northern India after viral social media videos showed them being used as firecrackers.Karan, 14, went through surgery at Hamidia Hospital in BhopalMore than 100 cases of carbide gun-related eye injuries have been reported in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal district alone, with at least 15 requiring surgery. Another 100 cases have been reported from three other districts. In Bihar state, 170 cases have been reported, with 40 requiring surgery, says Dr Bibhuti Prassan Sinha, who heads the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology in Patna city. The actual numbers are likely to be higher, he added.Cases have also been reported from the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, as well as capital Delhi. Some states, including Madhya Pradesh, have now banned the use of carbide guns as firecrackers and several sellers have been arrested.Kavitha Kumar, head of ophthalmology at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, says that patients have been coming in with mild, moderate and severe eye injuries.\"In milder cases, skin on the eye and around it has sustained chemical injuries and thermal burns. In moderate cases, chemical particulate matter has caused mild damage to the cornea and in severe cases, there's extensive damage to the cornea, causing temporary vision loss. With surgery, the patient may be able to regain their sight over time,\" she says. Some doctors told the BBC that they were shocked by the severity of the injuries. Dr Aditi Dubey from Hamidia Hospital said that she had never seen chemical injuries caused by Diwali firecrackers and had to research what \"carbide guns\" were.Many patients said that they bought the gun after seeing it on Instagram Reels and YouTube videos. An attractive aspect was the price - at 150-200 rupees ($1.70-$2; £1.28-£1.70) a piece, it was a relatively cheap firecracker that promised to make a big impact.A search for the term \"carbide gun\" on Instagram and YouTube throws up dozens of videos of young people making and using these devices, often accompanied by rap music. Carbide guns began popping up in local markets in the weeks before DiwaliSome accounts have also termed these videos \"science experiments\" with hashtags like \"useful project\" and \"experiment video\".Dr Sinha told the BBC that one of his patients was an engineering student who made the gun at home after watching such videos. He's currently being treated after losing vision in one of his eyes.Calcium carbide is a regulated substance in India - its possession, use and manufacturing are controlled by law because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse.When it comes in contact with water, it produces acetylene gas, which is highly flammable and has damaging properties on health.Under the Calcium Carbide Rules, 1987, a licence is needed for its sale, purchase and storage - but only for quantities above 200kg.A government official in Bhopal who didn't want to be named told the BBC that calcium carbide is still widely used to artificially ripen fruit despite a federal ban as it contains traces of poisonous substances.Alzain and his mother, Afreen, at Hamidia HospitalHarinarayanachari Mishra, Police Commissioner of Bhopal, told the BBC that carbide guns are also used in northern India during wedding festivities and by farmers to drive away monkeys.Dr Partha Biswas, president of the All India Ophthalmological Society, says carbide guns should be banned urgently.\"It's a national problem. And the seriousness of these incidents shouldn't be minimised as mere \"accidents\" that took place during the Diwali festival,\" he says.He adds that there's potential for these guns to be used as firecrackers during other festivals and events, like when India wins a cricket match or during New Year.\"These crude 'carbide bombs' or 'carbide guns' can cause permanent blindness, disfigurement and disability,\" he says, demanding a nationwide crackdown on manufacturers and sellers of the guns as well as more control over the supply chain of calcium carbide.Back at Hamidia Hospital, Alzain, whose left eye was operated on after he lost his vision, sits inside the tight embrace of his mother. The seven-year-old had pestered his uncle to buy the gun after watching videos on YouTube. Alzain's worried mother, Afreen, hasn't left his bedside since he was admitted a week ago.\"I'm scared for his future,\" she says. \"I hope he's able to see again.\"",

    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "A woman who raped and murdered 12 year-old Lola Daviet in Paris has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in a case that has shocked France. Dahbia Benkired, aged 27, must spend at least 30 years in prison after a panel of judges and a jury decided to impose the country's harshest possible penalty.A whole-life term is extremely rare in France and Benkired is the first woman to receive it.Those who have been given the sentence include serial killer and rapist Michel Fourniret and jihadist Salah Abdeslam, who took part in the 2015 Paris attacks which killed 130 people.Following the verdict, Lola's mother Delphine Daviet said: \"We believed in justice and we got it.\" Her brother Thibault, added: \"We have restored the memory of my sister, we have restored the truth.\"Warning: This story contains distressing detailsLola was murdered in October 2022. Her body was discovered in a plastic storage box in the courtyard of the building where she lived in north-eastern Paris. Benkired is an Algerian immigrant who was under orders to leave the country. French right-wing and far-right politicians have seized on the case.The prosecutor in the trial had argued for Benkired to receive the longest sentence possible. Benkired was examined by psychiatric experts and found to have \"psychopathic\" traits but otherwise sane.The prosecutor told a panel of three judges and six jurors: \"Make no mistake no drug treatment can fundamentally transform Ms Benkired's personality. When there is no illness, there is no treatment.\"Before jurors began their deliberations on Friday, Benkired told the court: \"I ask for forgiveness and what I did is horrible.\"That's all I have to say.\"CCTV footage from the afternoon of 14 October, 2022 showed Benkired, then 24 years-old, approaching Lola after she returned home from school.According to reports, Benkired lured Lola into an apartment her older sister was sub-letting in the building.   Over an hour-and-a-half, Benkired subjected the 12-year-old to a sexual assault before attacking her with scissors and a box cutter.Benkired bound Lola with duct tape, including around her head, leading to her death by asphyxiation.As he read out the verdict, the presiding judge referred to the \"extreme cruelty of the criminal acts\" which he described as \"true torture\".\"In determining the appropriate sentence, the court took into account the unspeakable psychological damage to the victim and her family in such violent and almost unspeakable circumstances,\" he said.Benkired was in France on a student visa but had failed to renew it. In July 2022, she was stopped at an airport in Paris and was given 30 days to leave the country. Days after Lola's murder in October that year, Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally party wrote on X that the woman \"had no business being in France\". Hard-right rival Éric Zemmour also took to social media to write: \"Lola's murderer should never have crossed her path.\"France's Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticised the \"indecency\" of politicians who, he said, \"should reflect on the consequences of their words\". Lola's mother and her father, Johan Daviet, denounced \"any use of the name and image of [our] child for political ends\".Mr Daviet died in 2024, aged 49.",

    "body": "17 hours agoRayhan DemytrieCaucasus correspondentGeorgia's former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili has appeared in court charged with large-scale money laundering - a shocking turnaround for one of the most loyal allies of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, widely seen as Georgia's de facto leader.Prosecutors said when his home was raided by investigators earlier this month they discovered $6.5m (£4.9m) in cash.Garibashvili, 43, twice served as prime minister during the Ivanishvili years – first from 2013-15 and then again from 2021 until January last year.Now he has pleaded guilty to corruption charges that could carry a 12-year jail term and he has been granted bail of one million Georgian lari ($368,000; £277,000).The charges against the former prime minister are the latest in a string of detentions of ex-government officials.But the case against Garibashvili is the first prosecution of a senior member of Georgia's governing elite, and it comes amid the ruling party's authoritarian pivot away from the West.While serving first as defence minister and then as prime minister between 2019 and 2024, he is alleged to have \"secretly and covertly engaged in various types of business activities and received a particularly large amount of income of illegal origin\".He is accused of laundering this income and falsely declaring money as gifts from family members.His lawyer, Amiran Giguashvili, confirmed his client was working with authorities.\"The court took into account that Mr Irakli agrees to the charges, does not hide from the investigation and co-operates,\" he told the BBC.The corruption case marks a dramatic fall for a politician who worked in Ivanishvili's companies before entering politics in 2011 as part of the billionaire's Georgian Dream party, which has been in power since 2012.In February 2014, he signed Georgia's Association Agreement with the European Union.However, in recent years he has led Georgia's shift away from the EU. He developed close ties with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and said Nato's enlargement was one of the main reasons for the war in Ukraine.According to Georgian political analyst Ghia Nodia, the former prime minister's downfall reflects Bidzina Ivanishvili's mistrust of his former political appointees.\"Ivanishvili is really the driver, he decided for some reason that there is some kind of treason in his team,\" Nodia said.\"At this point, he trusts [current PM Irakli] Kobakhidze but stopped trusting his closest lieutenant, not just Garibashvili, but also [ex-security chief] Liluashvili and others.\"Meanwhile, Georgia's political turmoil continues, a year after Georgian Dream won contested parliamentary elections which the then president refused to recognise.There have been daily protests since the government's announcement in November 2024 that it would halt membership talks with the EU, and most opposition leaders are now in jail.New legislations have targeted civil society, pro-opposition media, and journalists and activists have been imprisoned.\"Ivanishvili seems like [he's] under siege,\" says Ghia Nodia. \"He believes these crazy deep state conspiracies that the West wants to destroy him through these continuous protests in Georgia.\"",

    "body": "Luiz Inácio da Silva has announced he will run for a fourth term as Brazil's president in the nation's elections in 2026.The 79-year-old had indicated during his last election campaign that it would be his last - but stressed he did not feel his age in comments during a state visit to Indonesia on Thursday.\"I'm about to turn 80 years old, but you can be sure I have the same energy I had when I was 30. And I will run for a fourth term in Brazil,\" Lula told reporters.The decision to run comes despite Lula suffering health problems in office after winning in the tightest run-off election in the South American nation's history.Already Brazil's oldest president when inaugurated, in December last year he underwent surgery for a brain bleed caused by a blow to the head he sustained in a fall in the presidential palace.The left-wing leader beat then-incumbent Jair Bolsonaro by 51% to 49% in 2022.The right-wing former president is unlikely to be able to challenge Lula again, as he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a military coup aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the last election.The legal case which led to his lengthy house arrest has drawn the ire of US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.However, the two described having a \"friendly\" call earlier in October as Lula seeks to reduce those levies, and are expected to meet on Sunday.Lula, who turns 80 on Monday, has himself been imprisoned - for 18 months on corruption charges - but was freed in 2018 after the case was overturned.He has hinted at a possible fourth run for president since returning to office, but had so far stopped short of a formal announcement.Brazil's constitution limits presidents to two consecutive terms. Lula previously served a two-term stint between 2003 and 2011.",

    "body": "19 hours agoDearbail JordanReutersForged art claiming to show works by famous artists, including Picasso and Rembrandt, has been seized by policeBavarian police have seized millions of euros worth of forged art claiming to show works by Picasso, Rembrandt and Kahlo in an operation spanning Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Authorities in Bavaria said the main suspect is a 77-year-old German man who, along with 10 alleged accomplices, is facing charges of conspiracy and fraud.Investigators first became suspicious when the septuagenarian ringleader attempted to sell two supposedly original paintings by Picasso on the art market.He then wanted to sell De Staalmeesters, a famous oil painting by Dutch old master Rembrandt, for 120 million Swiss francs (£113m) - despite the original hanging in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.The Bavarian State Criminal Police Office (BLKA) said the forged De Staalmeesters - which is sometimes referred to as the Masters of the Clothmakers' Guild - was owned by an 84-year-old Swiss woman.She is now being investigated by the Amberg public prosecutor's office, the BLKA and Swiss authorities after the forged piece was confiscated in Switzerland.At the time, after being examined by an art expert, the police said: \"It was, as suspected, a copy and not a lost masterpiece by Rembrandt van Rijn.\"  The painting was seized during a co-ordinated series of dawn raids across Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein on Wednesday 15 October.During the searches, a large number of suspected art forgeries were found and seized, the BLKA said, along with \"documents, records, mobile phones, storage media and cloud data\".

They included copies of work by Mexican painter Frida Kahlo as well as Flemish old master Peter Paul Rubens, Italian sculptor Amedeo Modigliani and Spain's Joan Miró.He was assisted by 74-year-old German man who \"prepared expert reports specifically to confirm the authenticity of the artworks\".The BLKA said that he and the main suspect were arrested on the day of the raids before being conditionally released.The police said that the investigation is in progress.\"Among other things, all confiscated paintings will be examined in detail by experts and appraisers in the coming weeks,\" police said.",

    "body": "The US has placed sanctions on Colombia's President, Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\".The decision is the latest in a growing diplomatic dispute between the Latin American nation's first left-wing leader and his US counterpart Donald Trump.The two have clashed over US strikes on boats it says are being used to smuggle drugs, killing dozens including some Colombian nationals. Trump has said other nations had failed to stop the boats, while Petro has accused him of \"murder\".Colombia was once a close ally of Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter drug gangs.The US also trains Colombian narcotics agents - something the Trump administration has said it will continue to support.But in its sanctions decision, it singled out Petro as having presided over a \"disastrous and ineffective\" drug policy that had led to a large increase in cocaine production.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that since Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia had \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\".Sanctions have also been imposed on Colombia's Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, as well as Petro's wife and eldest son. All are barred from accessing assets and any properties they may have in the US. Petro responded that he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and that his administration had stemmed the growth of coca crops.\"What the US Treasury is doing is an arbitrariness typical of an oppressive regime,\" he said.Cocaine production is currently at record-high levels in Colombia, according to researcher Héctor Galeano from the Colombia-based Institute of Advanced Social and Cultural Studies of Latin America and the Caribbean.The US Treasury said that cocaine from Colombia was often purchased by Mexican cartels, which then smuggle it into the US.  The US says it is removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs, which grants it access to financial support. Colombia responded that it would cease buying weapons from the US.Petro has insisted that it was during the government of his predecessor, Iván Duque, that the area planted with coca had increased.He has also said that, in order for coca cultivation to decrease, what was needed was for demand for cocaine to go down in the US and in Europe.His primary attempts to curb drug-related criminality in Colombia have centred on facilitating peace negotiations between warring cartels that have for decades brought violence to the nation.His campaign promise of bringing \"total peace\" to Colombia appears to be collapsing, with mounting attacks and stalled negotiations.Petro told BBC News in September air strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean were an \"act of tyranny\".He used a speech at the UN in New York around the same time to argue the attacks were not about controlling the drug trade but serving a need to use \"violence to dominate Colombia and Latin America\".Imposing sanctions on a head of state is rare but not unprecedented. The leaders of countries including Russia, North Korea and Venezuela have previously been sanctioned.",

    "body": "New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James appeared in court in US District Court in Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday during a brief hearing where her legal team asked for a speedy trial.  Speaking outside of the courthouse after the arraignment, James accused Trump of using the justice system as a \"vehicle of retribution\" against her and other critics.She previously brought brought charges against others he considers political enemies.  \"There's no fear today,\" she said, as supporters outside cheered. On Friday, a judge set a trial date of 26 January.The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence, and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home.The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but instead was \"used as a rental investment property\" and was being rented to a family of three.The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.Sources have told US media that James bought the home for her great-niece in 2020 and that the relative never paid rent for the home. James' legal team also said in court filings this week that they plan to challenge the appointment of US attorney Lindsey Halligan to James' case. Trump appointed Ms Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert reportedly was ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.James' attorneys also are filing a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that it is \"vindictive\". She is one of several Trump critics who are under investigation or have faced criminal charges in recent weeks. The justice department charged Trump's former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey with making false statements to Congress. Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, is charged with sending and wilfully retaining national defence information.Trump last month called on his social media site Truth Social for Attorney General Pam Bondi, to bring charges against his political opponents. \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.James brought a civil fraud case against Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, in 2022. Trump was later found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£376m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud.",

    "body": "A German company inadvertently embroiled in the Louvre Museum heist after one of its lifts was used in the theft is making the most of its free publicity - by launching a new advertising campaign.Werne-based firm Böcker this week published a social media post featuring the now-famous image of its furniture ladder extending up to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo. \"When you need to move fast,\" reads a banner under the image. \"The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min - quiet as a whisper.\"Video has emerged of the alleged thieves escaping on the mechanical ladder after stealing €88m worth (£76m; $102m) of France's crown jewels on Sunday.The company's managing director, Alexander Böcker, told news agency AFP on Wednesday that, when it became clear no one was injured in the heist, it had used \"a touch of humour\" to draw attention to the family-run business.\"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us,\" Mr Böcker said.\"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company.\" How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Reaction to Böcker's new campaign has been enthusiastic, with responses on social media including \"marketing genius\" and \"excellent, that is German quality\".\"Your messaging takes the crown,\" one commenter quipped.Mr Böcker told AFP that he recognised his company's device from news reports, saying the machine was sold \"a few years ago to a French customer who rents this type of equipment in Paris and the surrounding area\".The alleged jewel thieves had arranged to have the machine demonstrated to them last week and had stolen it during the demonstration, he said.The thieves arrived at the Louvre on Sunday shortly after the museum opened its doors.Within eight minutes, they had made off with some of France's most valuable treasures, including those belonging to former royalty and imperial rulers.Among the eight items stolen were diadems, necklaces, earrings and brooches adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.The Louvre reopened on Wednesday, a few days after what has been called France's most shocking theft.The museum's director admitted on Wednesday that security failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft and that CCTV around its perimeter was weak and \"aging\".\"We failed these jewels,\" Laurence des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she added.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors said they believed the robbers acted under orders from a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "15 hours agoMallory MoenchStandWithUsMichael Smuss in an updated handout photoMichael Smuss, a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland who resisted the Nazis, has died aged 99 in Israel. He joined the ghetto uprising as a teenager in 1943, helping to make petrol bombs. Taken prisoner, he survived concentration camps and a death march before the end of World War II. After the war, he became an artist and Holocaust educator. The embassies of Germany and Poland in Israel paid tribute to him on social media. \"He repeatedly risked his life during the Holocaust, fighting for survival and helping other prisoners in the Warsaw Ghetto – even after he was captured by the Nazis and deported to concentration camps,\" the German embassy stated on X.The Polish embassy said Smuss \"lectured youth on the history of Polish Jews and expressed his memories through art. His legacy endures.\"The Polish embassy and the Holocaust Educational Trust, a UK charity, called Smuss the last surviving fighter of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. However, in 2018, Israeli officials and international media, including the BBC, reported that Simcha Rotem, who had just died aged 94, was the last surviving fighter of the uprising.Last month, Germany's ambassador to Israel awarded Smuss with the German Federal Cross of Merit, in recognition of his contribution to Holocaust education and promoting dialogue between the two countries, the embassy said.\"Thousands of people, especially young people in Germany, have learned from his testimonies.\"German Embassy in IsraelThe German ambassador to Israel awarded a medal to Michael Smuss in SeptemberSmuss was born in 1926 in the Free City of Danzig, a city-state that is now Gdansk, Poland. He later moved to Lodz before being deported to the Warsaw Ghetto with his father.Hundreds of thousands of Jews were crammed into the ghetto, where they faced poverty, starvation, disease and cold.Since Smuss spoke German, he was taken outside to work in a factory repairing and repainting helmets, he recounted in a video recorded for the Sumter Museum in the US in 2022.He joined the Jewish Resistance in the ghetto, and he and others started stealing as much paint thinner as possible to make petrol bombs.\"We filled up bottles which were put up on the roofs of all the houses close to the entrance of the ghetto with the expectation that once they're going to come, we'd be throwing them down\", he said.On 19 April the Nazis came to empty the ghetto, an enclave in Warsaw created by the Nazis to segregate and persecute Jews. The resistance fought back with weapons they had exchanged for warm clothes from Italian soldiers who had been sent from Africa to the Russian front.The resistance, which Smuss called \"the greatest uprising in this war against Germany\", lasted 28 days.\"It was very rough... no shower, no food. They were burning up, liquidating one house after another, full of smoke burning in your eyes,\" he said.He described thousands of bodies lying in front of houses and \"the smell of gas and decomposed bodies\".He, among some others, was taken prisoner on 29 April.Corbis via Getty ImagesMichael Smuss, identified by The Jerusalem Post as fourth from left, taken prisoner after the Warsaw Ghetto UprisingThey were put on a train to the Treblinka extermination camp. As he witnessed people dying on the journey, \"my heart became a stone\", he said.Along the way, the train was stopped by employers looking to retrieve workers that had been taken from their factories. Another German came looking for experienced workers, and Smuss offered himself and those he knew.\"When we left on the train to Treblinka, I was sure that my life was over,\" he told The Jerusalem Post earlier this year. \"But when the train came to a halt, I felt with all of my being that on this day I was not going to die.\"He was moved and endured forced labour at other camps, and finally a death march to Dachau, before his Nazi captors fled incoming American troops.He told The Jerusalem Post that his father was killed trying to escape one camp, while his mother and sister, who had been able to stay in Lodz, survived.Smuss initially returned to Poland, but then moved to the US, where he worked, studied and started a family. After experiencing trauma symptoms, he moved to Israel in 1979 alone to seek help, where he took up art and educating others about the Holocaust. He is survived by his wife.",

    "body": "16 hours agoHugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  , Jerusalem and Raffi Berg,LondonUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said \"a lot of countries\" have offered to be part of an international security force for Gaza - a key part of President Donald Trump's peace plan - but added Israel would have to be comfortable with participants.Speaking on a visit to Israel, Rubio said talks on forming the International Stabilization Force (ISF) were continuing and that it would come into effect \"as soon as it possibly can\".It remained unclear, however, how such a force could be deployed without an understanding with Hamas.He said the Israel-Hamas ceasefire had made \"historic\" progress since it began two weeks ago, but warned to expect \"ups and downs and twists and turns\".\"There is no plan B,\" he said. \"This is the best plan. It's the only plan. And it's one that we think can succeed.\" Rubio said conditions had to be created \"so that never again will we see what happened on 7 October, so that you can actually be in a place [Gaza] that no longer has elements operating within it that are a threat to Israel or to their own people for that matter\".The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages.At least 68,280 Palestinians have been killed by the Israel military campaign that followed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the United Nations as reliable.Rubio said Hamas will be disarmed, as required by Trump's plan. \"If Hamas refuses to demilitarise, it'll be a violation of the agreement and that'll have to be enforced,\" he said.\"Hamas cannot govern and cannot be involved in governing the future of Gaza,\" he added.Rubio's visit caps a week in which senior American officials, including Vice-President JD Vance, came to Israel. It's a sign that Washington is determined to make Trump's plan for Gaza succeed and is concerned that actions by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government might collapse it. In Israeli media, the effort has been described as \"Bibi-sitting\", a play with the prime minister's nickname.In recent days, multiple reports have suggested the White House's frustration with the Israeli government, fuelled by the military's deadly response to an attack it blamed on Hamas in Gaza last weekend and the vote in the Israeli parliament towards the annexation of the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, while Vance was visiting.The Israeli Haaretz newspaper reported that American officials said they would \"not tolerate any surprises from Israel that could jeopardise the ceasefire\", and that they were expecting advance notice from Israel before any strikes in Gaza. \"In practice,\" the report said, \"the US [was] taking over certain security authorities from Israel\".In public, Netanyahu, whose coalition relies on the support of ultra-nationalist ministers, has rejected reports that Washington is making decisions on Israel's behalf, describing the country's relationship as a partnership. The apparent pressure from the country's most important ally, at a time when Israel faces unprecedented isolation, risks derailing his strategy to frame the war in Gaza as a victory at home. This narrative will be essential in the campaign for the next parliamentary election, which should be held by October 2026.Both Rubio and Vance tried to strike a positive tone in their public statements – both said they were optimistic the ceasefire would hold – while also acknowledging that the negotiations over the remaining points would be difficult and long. Those issues include the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, the future governance of Gaza and the formation of the ISF, as well as the disarmament by Hamas, and they offered no indication of how those talks would proceed.Rubio said there were \"a lot of countries\" that offered to take part in the ISF. \"Obviously, as you put together this force, it'll have to be people that Israel's comfortable, or countries that Israel's comfortable with as well,\" he added, without elaborating.This appeared to be a reference to Turkey, which has become a major player in the negotiations, amid reports Israel has vetoed the country's involvement.The scope of the ISF's mission remains unclear, as countries appear to be concerned with the possibility that its forces might end up confronting Hamas fighters if there is no agreement with the group over the ISF deployment.Seeing the peace plan through is \"not going to be an easy ride\", Rubio said. \"There are going to be bumps along the road, but we have to make it work.\"",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship1 hour agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the world's largest warship to be sent to the Caribbean.The USS Gerald R Ford can carry up to 90 aircraft and its deployment marks a massive increase in US firepower in the region.The US has conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the area as part of what it says is a war on drug traffickers. US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power. The US does not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?The Pentagon said on Friday that the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations\", spokesman Sean Parnell said.Maduro accused the US of seeking \"a new eternal war\" in his address.\"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,\" he told state media.The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela.\"We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" he said earlier this week.The US has also bolstered its air presence in the region. BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.Military analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroOn Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed in an operation in the Caribbean.He said the boat had belonged to the Tren de Aragua - a transnational criminal organisation which has its base in Venezuela and has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the US State Department.The US air strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. \"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up was intended to \"strike fear\" into the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike was the latest the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean as well.At least 43 people have been killed.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic senators wrote to the White House, alleging the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval. Trump has said he has the legal authority to order the strikes.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC that the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has appeared unwilling to challenge. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group.  ",

    "body": "13 hours agoJaroslav Lukiv and Vitaliy Shevchenko,Russia editor at Downing StreetEPA/ShutterstockMore than 20 nations supporting Ukraine have pledged to \"take Russian oil and gas off the global market\" as part of efforts to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war.\"We're choking off funding for Russia's war machine,\" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, after hosting a summit of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" in London.The UK and US have in recent days sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies, while the EU targeted Moscow's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also in London, said \"pressure\" on Russia was the only way to stop the fighting. However, no long-range missile deliveries were announced at the summit.Zelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets – including oil refineries and weapons depots – deep inside Russia.But during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks.On Thursday, Putin warned that if \"such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming\".Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014.Speaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Sir Keir said Putin was \"not serious about peace\", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a \"clear plan for the rest of the year\" on supporting Ukraine.The UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to \"unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence\". He gave no further details.On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years - but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth €140bn (£122bn).Asked about a so-called \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas Eve.In London, the \"coalition of the willing\" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences\" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure.Zelensky warned that Russia \"wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment\", adding: \"They want to break us.\"Comments by the leaders in London will be disappointing for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Kyiv's allies were planning to prevent Russia from attacking Ukraine.No doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Sir Keir said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.But there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or force Putin to the negotiating table.EPA/ShutterstockUkrainian officials say a kindergarten was hit in a Russian air strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv earlier this weekIn Ukraine, several people who spoke to the BBC said they were more focused on everyday problems, rather than following Zelensky's trip to the UK.Yana Kolomiets, from Odesa, said there was a lack of electricity, heating and water in the southern city.\"The more scary thing is that the Russians started launching guided bombs on our region,\" she added.Tetiana Dankevych, from the capital Kyiv, said power outages and a problems with water supplies caused by Russian strikes were making life \"very difficult\".\"I don't have a feeling this war will end soon,\" she said.Further support for Ukraine's energy infrastructure was among the issues discussed at the London summit - however, no specific announcements were made.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also took part in the London meeting, while other leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - participated via a video link.Ukraine and its Western allies have publicly agreed with Trump's proposal that the fighting should be immediately frozen along the vast front line for negotiations to begin.Russia has rejected this idea, repeating demands that Kyiv and its allies describe as de facto capitulation by Ukraine.Earlier on Friday, Zelensky held talks with King Charles at Windsor – their third meeting this year.",

She passed away \"peacefully\" in a Bangkok hospital at 21:21 local time (14:21 GMT) on Friday, according to the Thai Royal Household Bureau.Sirikit had \"suffered several illnesses\" while in hospital since 2019, including a blood infection this month, it added.For more than six decades, Queen Sirikit was married to Thailand's longest-reigning monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016. In their globe-trotting heyday, she was seen as a style icon.King Vajiralongkorn has ordered that the Thai Royal Household Bureau organise a royal funeral, the statement added.Queen Sirikit's body will lie in state at the Grand Palace's Dusit Thorne Hall in Bangkok, it said.Thai royal family members will also observe a year of mourning.ReutersGetty ImagesQueen Sirikit (centre) married the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej (right) in 1950As a young queen, Sirikit was regarded as a fashion iconQueen Sirikit met her future husband, King Bhumibol, while studying music in Paris, where her father was at the time stationed as Thai ambassador to France.\"It was hate at first sight,\" she said in a 1980 BBC documentary about the Thai monarchy, Soul of a Nation, adding that he had arrived late to their first meeting. \"He said he would arrive at four o'clock in the afternoon. He arrived at seven o'clock, kept me standing there, practising curtsy and curtsy,\" she said.The couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before King Bhumibol was crowned in Bangkok.As a young couple in the 1960s, Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol travelled around the world, meeting famous faces including US President Dwight Eisenhower, the late Queen Elizabeth II and Elvis Presley.During that decade, she frequently made international best-dressed lists.In the rare 1980 interview with the BBC, she also described the relationship between the monarchy and people in Thailand, which continues to observe strict lese-majeste laws forbidding insult of the monarchy. She said: \"Kings and queens of Thailand have always been in close contact with the people and they usually regard the king as the father of the nation.\"That is why we do not have much private life, because we are considered father and mother of the nation.\"She was seen as a key maternal figure for the country, with her birthday, 12 August, marked as Mother's Day since 1976.In 2008, she attended the funeral of an anti-government protester killed in violent clashes with police. Queen Sirikit suffered a stroke in 2012, after which she was rarely seen in public.She is survived by her son and three daughters. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, DelhiJioStarBill Gates appeared on Thursday night's episode to talk about maternal and child health with Smriti IraniA crossover no-one saw coming.That's how many in India are describing Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates's appearance in an iconic Hindi TV drama with actress and former federal minister Smriti Irani.Mr Gates appeared on Thursday night's episode of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi (Because the Mother-in-Law Was Also Once Daughter-in-Law) to talk about maternal and child health with Irani.The Gates Foundation has been working on curbing infant and maternal mortality for years with governments in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - the two northern Indian states with huge populations that are also among the most disadvantaged regions.Government data shows a significant improvement in maternal and child health indicators over the years, including in the two states. But in a country steeped in patriarchy, challenges remain.In such a scenario, experts say messaging becomes extremely important to keep the drumbeat going to change norms and to make people more aware of the need to take care of their girls and mothers.And to do that, Mr Gates perhaps couldn't have chosen a better platform than Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.First launched in July 2000, the series had a very successful long innings  had a very successful long innings with several thousand episodes that were broadcast almost daily on Star Plus for eight- and-a-half years before it was discontinued, says Shailaja Bajpai, columnist and Readers' Editor for Print new site. In July, 25 years after it first hit the screens, Kyunki... returned for its second innings.JioStarBill Gates' unexpected cameo seems to have brought the show back into the limelightIndian audiences found the show, based on the complex domestic relationship between Irani's character Tulsi and her mother-in-law, riveting. The trials and tribulations of the dutiful new bride had families reorganise their daily routines to ensure they didn't miss out a single episode.Irani's character was - and is - at the centre of this story of the fictitious Virani family. In the first season, she played a young woman who fell in love with and married the scion of a wealthy family. A quarter of a century later, Tulsi is middle aged, her children are all grown up and she is about to become a ma-in-law herself. But the battles she's fighting now are still with jealous and misguided family members and the drama - and the melodrama - of the original season remain in abundance, Ms Bajpai says.\"If you take away the gadgets, the mobile phones and the laptops, essentially remove all the window dressing, it's still the same story. It's just been updated.\" But, she adds that one thing that's different now is that the social messaging has increased. \"I think that's because it fits her profile more. She served as the minister for women and child development so the show now talks about divorce, child and maternal health and other socially-relevant issues.\"The four-minute-long segment with Mr Gates starts with the Microsoft founder greeting her in American-accented Hindi - \"Namaste Tulsi-ji,\" he says, asking her if he'd said it right?\"Yes, absolutely perfect,\" she beams.The call comes after Tulsi is seen in a viral video at a godh-bharai (baby shower) dishing out health advice to an expectant mother. Tulsi's son, who's posted the video, tells her that he had tagged Mr Gates, wondering if he'd be willing to talk to Tulsi on a video call. \"He's accepted,\" he squeals with delight.Tulsi initially seems a bit nervous. \"What will I say to him? I only do video calls with you all or your father about grocery shopping,\" she says.jiostarFirst launched in July 2000, the series ran for eight- and-a-half years. In July, 25 years after it first hit the screens, it returned for its second inningsBut once the laptop is fired up and Mr Gates comes in vision, Tulsi comes into her own, explaining the reason for the \"traditional\" ritual.\"We come together to bless a young expectant mother, we wish her lots of good health,\" she says.\"We tell women how essential it is to look after their health, their nutrition and diet. We tell them to follow the doctors' instructions and go to a hospital for their delivery.\"  The two agree that \"when mothers are healthy, children thrive and the world can make significant progress\".In a statement to the BBC, makers of the show JioStar Entertainment said the show was using storytelling to spotlight critical issues around maternal and child health.\"We believe that storytelling can do more than entertain, it can inform, inspire and drive awareness on issues that matter,\" JioStar's Sumanta Bose said. \"By weaving topics of social significance into our narratives, we aim to create impact that reaches beyond the screen and brings about a meaningful difference in people's lives,\" he added. The release says that Mr Gates will appear in three episodes of the show.In its second innings, Ms Bajpai says, the show has had to compete with a multitude of other offerings on OTT platforms and hasn't found the same resonance with the audience.But Mr Gates' unexpected cameo seems to have brought it back into the limelight - for now at least.A promo of the episode received more than six million views on Instagram alone in less than a day, with thousands of comments echoing a sense of surprise and amusement.\"What is this multiverse,\" said one comment which was liked by more than 17,000 people. Another said: \"It's so cringe but I also love it so much.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoYolande Knell and Jacob Evans,in JerusalemBBCThree year-old Zain Tafesh died from leukemia earlier this weekSo many lives in Gaza still hang in the balance.In different wards of Nasser Hospital lie two 10-year-old boys, one shot by Israeli fire and paralysed from the neck down, another with a brain tumour.Now that a fragile ceasefire is in place, they are among some 15,000 patients who the World Health Organization (WHO) says are in need of urgent medical evacuations.Amar Abu Said is paralysed from the neck and needs specialist treatmentOla Abu Said sits gently stroking the hair of her son, Amar.  His family says he was in their tent in southern Gaza when he was hit by a stray bullet fired by an Israeli drone.  It is lodged between two of his vertebrae, leaving him paralysed.\"He needs surgery urgently,\" Ola says, \"but it's complicated.  Doctors told us it could cause his death, a stroke or brain haemorrhage.  He needs surgery in a well-equipped place.\"Right now, Gaza is anything but that.  After two years of war, its hospitals have been left in a critical state.Ahmed al-Jadd and his sister Shahd lost their father in the warSitting by the bedside of her younger brother, Ahmed al-Jadd, his sister Shahd says her brother was a constant comfort to her through two years of war and displacement.\"He's only 10 and, when our situation got so bad, he used to go out and sell water to help bring some money for us,\" she says.  A few months ago, he showed the first signs of ill health.\"Ahmad's mouth started drooping to one side,\" Shahd explains. \"One time he kept telling me, 'Shahd my head hurts', and we just gave him paracetamol, but later, his right hand stopped moving.\"The one-time university student is desperate for her brother to travel abroad to have his tumour removed.\"We can't lose him. We already lost our father, our home and our dreams,\" Shahd says. \"When the ceasefire happened it gave us a bit of a hope that maybe there was a 1% chance that Ahmed could travel and get treated.\"ReutersInternational agencies are desperate to increase the number of evacuationsOn Wednesday, the WHO co-ordinated the first medical convoy to exit Gaza since the fragile ceasefire began on 10 October.  It took 41 patients and 145 carers to hospitals abroad via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, with ambulances and buses taking the group on to Jordan.  Some have stayed for care there.The UN agency has called for numbers of medical evacuations to be rapidly increased to deal with the thousands of cases of sick and wounded.  It wants to be able to bring out patients through Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt as it has done previously.However, Israel has said it is keeping the crossing closed until Hamas \"fulfils\" its commitments under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal by returning the bodies of deceased hostages. Israel has kept the Gaza side of the Egyptian border closed since May 2024 when it took control during the war.Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said \"the most impactful measure\" would be if Israel could allow Gazan patients to be treated in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as happened before the war.Top EU officials and foreign ministers of more than 20 countries - including the UK - have previously called for this, offering \"financial contributions, provision of medical staff or equipment needed\".A funeral was held for eight-year old Saadi Abu Taha who died this week from stomach cancer\"Hundreds of patients could be treated easily and efficiently in a short time if this route reopened to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network and the hospitals in the West Bank,\" says Dr Fadi Atrash, CEO of the Augusta Victoria Hospital on the Mount of Olives.\"We can at least treat 50 patients per day for chemotherapy and radiation and even more than that.  Other hospitals can do a lot of surgeries,\" the doctor told me.\"Referring them to East Jerusalem is the shortest distance, the most efficient way, because we have the mechanism. We speak the same language, we're the same culture, in many cases we have medical files for Gazan patients.  They've been receiving treatment in East Jerusalem hospitals for more than a decade before the war.\"The BBC asked Cogat, the Israeli defence body which controls Gaza's crossings, why the medical route was not being approved.  Cogat said it was a decision by the political echelon and referred queries to the prime minister's office, which did not offer further explanation.After the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, Israel cited security reasons for not allowing Gazan patients in other Palestinian territories.  It also pointed out that its main crossing point for people at Erez had been targeted by Hamas fighters during the assault.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that in the year to August 2025, at least 740 people, including nearly 140 children, died while on waiting lists.At Nasser hospital, the director of paediatrics and maternity, Dr Ahmed al-Farra, expresses his frustration.\"It's the most difficult feeling for a doctor to be present, able to diagnose a condition but unable to carry out essential tests and lacking the necessary treatments,\" Dr al-Farra says. \"This has happened in so many cases, and unfortunately, there's daily loss of life due to our lack of capabilities.\"Since the ceasefire, hope has run out for more of his patients.In the past week in the hospital grounds, a funeral took place for Saadi Abu Taha, aged eight, who died from intestinal cancer.A day later, three-year old Zain Tafesh and Luay Dweik, aged eight, died from hepatitis.Without action, there are many more Gazans who will not have a chance to live in peace.",

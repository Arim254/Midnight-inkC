    "body": "Jeremy Bowen: Syria feels lighter without the Assads' crushing weight - but now there are new problems3 days agoJeremy BowenInternational EditorBBCA year ago, the war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down.A rebel force had broken out of Idlib, a Syrian province on the border with Turkey, and was storming towards Damascus. It was led by a man known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and his militia group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Jolani was a nom-de-guerre, reflecting his family's roots in the Golan Heights, Syria's southern highlands, annexed by Israel after it was occupied in 1967. His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.One year later, he is interim president, and Bashar al-Assad is in a gilded exile in Russia. Syria is still in ruins. In every city and village I have visited this last 10 days, people were living in skeletal buildings gutted by war. But for all the new Syria's problems, it feels much lighter without the crushing, cruel weight of the Assads.Getty ImagesSyria is still in ruins. In cities and villages, many people are living in skeletal buildings gutted by warSharaa has found the going easier abroad than at home. He has won the argument with Saudi Arabia and the West that he is Syria's best chance of a stable future.In May, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia arranged a brief meeting between Sharaa and US President Donald Trump. Afterwards, Trump called him a \"young attractive tough guy\".At home, Syrians know his weaknesses and the problems Syria faces better than foreigners. Sharaa's writ does not run in the north-east, where the Kurds are in control, or parts of the south where Syrian Druze, another minority sect, want a separate state backed by their Israeli allies. On the coast Alawites – Assad's sect – fear a repeat of the massacres they suffered in March.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump called him a 'young attractive tough guy'A year ago, the new masters of Damascus, like most of the armed rebels in Syria, were Sunni Islamists. Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects. Sunnis are the majority. As well as Kurds and Druze, there are Christians, many of whom find it hard to forget Sharaa's jihadist past.Image of a man who outgrew his jihadist rootsIn the first week of December last year, it was hard to believe that the HTS offensive was moving so fast. It took them three days to capture Aleppo, Syria's northern powerhouse.Compare that with the tortured years between 2012 and 2016, when the regime's army and rebel militias had fought for control of the city: that had ended in victory for Assad after Russia's president Vladimir Putin deployed his air force and artillery to add decisive firepower to the regime's ruthless tactics.When I visited the former rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo a few weeks after they had fallen to the regime, large areas were devastated by Russian bombing. Some streets were blocked by rubble that went up to first-floor balconies.But by the end of 2024, across the country, government troops had melted away. Both reluctant conscripts and regime loyalists were no longer prepared to fight and die for a corrupt and cruel regime that repaid them with poverty and oppression.AFP via Getty ImagesOne year ago - celebrations marking the dawn of a new era for SyriaA few days after Assad fled with his family to Russia, I interviewed Syria's victorious new leader in the presidential palace.It perches high on a crag overlooking Damascus, designed as an ever-visible reminder for the city's citizens of the all-seeing power of the Assads. By then Jolani had discarded his name, along with his combat fatigues.Sharaa sat down in the chilly halls of the unheated palace wearing a smart jacket, pressed trousers and shiny black shoes. He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.Israel dismissed it, however. And jihadist hardliners branded Sharaa as a traitor, selling out his religion and his own history.Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-SharaaI had packed in a hurry to report on a war, never expecting the regime to crumble so fast. My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.A weakened IS in SyriaSharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.The reality is that IS in Syria is weak. Its attacks this year have been mostly against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east.That has changed in the last few weeks, leading up to the anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Getty ImagesThe war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down one year agoAs security forces have raided IS cells, the jihadists have killed three soldiers and two former Assad operatives in cities controlled by the government, according to data collected by Charles Lister, a leading commentator on Syria, and published in a newsletter Syria Weekly. IS social media channels monitored by the BBC continue to tell Syrian Sunnis that Sharaa has betrayed them.Without producing any proof, they have posted claims that he has been an agent of the US and UK, working to undermine the jihadist project.Winning over Trump and the westSharaa's overtures to the west have been remarkably successful.Within two weeks of taking power in Syria, he received a delegation of senior American diplomats. Immediately, the Americans scrapped the $10 million bounty the they had put on his arrest.Since then, sanctions imposed on Assad's Syria have been steadily reduced. The most swingeing, the Caesar Act, has been suspended and could be repealed by the US Congress in the new year.A major milestone came in November when Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit the White House.APTrump sprayed Sharaa with cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take homeTrump's welcome in the Oval Office was relaxed. He sprayed Sharaa with Trump-branded cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take home for his wife, jokingly asking him how many he has. \"One,\" Sharaa answered, as he blinked away clouds of fragrance.Away from the larking around for the cameras, Saudi Arabia as well as western governments see Sharaa as the best bet – the only one – to stabilise a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East. If Syria slipped back into civil war, there would be zero chance of reducing the violent turbulence in the region.One senior western diplomat told me that the conditions for civil war still exist. That is because of the lasting scars of half a century of dictatorship and 14 years of a war that started as an uprising against the Assads' oppressive rule and turned into an increasingly sectarian fight.AFP via Getty ImagesMany western governments see Sharaa as the best bet to stabilise Syria. His minister for foreign affairs, Assad al-Shaibani is front rightSharaa is a Sunni Muslim, Syria's largest religious group. His government does not control the whole country. In the last year he has not been able to persuade, or force, Kurds in the north-east and Druze in the south to accept the authority of Damascus. On the coast, the Alawite community is nervous and restive.The Alawites are a sect that originated in Shia Islam, with their heartland on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The Assads are Alawites.The founder of the regime, Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad, built his power on the Alawite minority, around 10% of the population. Just the sound of the Alawite accent, especially coming from a man in uniform – or worse, a leather-jacketed operative from one of the regime's intelligence agencies – used to make other Syrians nervous.Syria will not recover if sectarian killing continues. Stopping more serious outbreaks of violence in the next 12 months is the government's most serious challenge.The slow pace of justiceJust before the anniversary of Assad's fall, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressed serious concern about the slow pace of justice. A spokesman said, \"While the interim authorities have taken encouraging steps towards addressing past violations, these steps are only the beginning of what needs to be done.\"Some Syrians have taken matters into their own hands, along, at times, with government forces. The OHCHR said that hundreds have been killed over the past year \"by the security forces and affiliated groups, elements associated with the former government, local armed groups and unidentified armed individuals\".They added: \"Other reported violations and abuses include sexual violence, arbitrary detentions, destruction of homes, forced evictions, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"Alawite, Druze, Christian and Bedouin communities were mainly affected by the violence, the OHCHR said, which has been fed by rising hate speech both on- and offline.Anadolu via Getty ImagesA graduation ceremony for general security personnel last monthA big risk for 2026 is a repeat of last March's sectarian violence in Alawite areas.In the security vacuum that followed the fall of the Assad regime, the new government attempted to stamp its authority on the Syrian coast with a series of arrests. An investigation by OCHCR found that \"pro-former government fighters responded by capturing, killing, and injuring hundreds of interim government forces\".Damascus responded harshly and lost control of militant armed factions that carried a systematic series of deadly attacks on Alawites.The UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed in the ensuing massacres. The vast majority were adult men, but victims included approximately 100 women, the elderly and the disabled, as well as children.The Sharaa government cooperated with the UN investigation. Some of its forces managed to rescue Alawites and it has put some of the ringleaders of the massacres on trial. ReutersThe UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed during sectarian violence in Alawite areas in MarchThe UN Syria Commission of Inquiry confirmed it had found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks. But the concern then and for the future was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groups that had supposedly joined its security forces.In July in the southern province of Suweida, serious violence between Druze and Bedouin communities shook the Sharaa administration to its roots. The Druze religion developed out of Islam around a thousand years ago, and its followers, who some Muslims believe are heretics, amount to around 3% of Syria's population.When government forces entered Suweida, supposedly to restore order, they ended up fighting Druze militias. Israel, which has its own Druze community that is fiercely loyal to the Jewish state, intervened. Its airstrikes included the near destruction of the ministry of defence in Damascus. It took a rapid American intervention to force a ceasefire that stopped a spiral down into much worse violence. Tens of thousands of people were driven from their homes and remain displaced.Getty ImagesA UN inquiry found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks in March. But the concern was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groupsThe Israel questionIt is still not clear whether Sharaa and his interim government are strong enough to survive another crisis as serious as that. Israel remains a looming and dangerous presence to Syrians.After the fall of Assad, the Israelis launched a series of major air strikes to destroy what was left of the old regime's military capacity. The IDF advanced out of the occupied Golan Heights to take control of more Syrian territory, which it still holds.The Israelis were taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to weaken a country it saw as hostile, destroying weapons it said might be turned in its direction.More from InDepthAttempts by the US to broker a security agreement between Israel and Syria have stalled in the last two months or so.Syria wants to return to an agreement originally negotiated by Henry Kissinger when he was US Secretary of State in 1974. Netanyahu wants Israel to stay in the land it seized and has demanded that Syria demilitarises a large area south of Damascus.In the last month Israel has intensified its ground incursions into Syria. Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November. The IDF said they were arresting Sunni militants who were planning attacks. Local men fought back, wounding six Israelis as the raiding party was forced into a hurried retreat, abandoning a military vehicle that they later destroyed with an airstrike. The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel. The Damascus government called it a war crime. Calls for retaliation intensified.Dia Images via Getty ImagesThe border village of Beit Jinn was raided by IDF troops on 28 NovemberIn Washington, Trump was clearly worried by the raid. He posted on his Truth Social platform that he was \"very satisfied\" with Sharaa's efforts at stabilising Syria.He warned that it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous state\".In Beit Jinn I met Khalil Abu Daher on his way back from hospital, his arm in plaster after surgery for a bullet wound. He invited me to his home, which is close to where the Israelis were exchanging fire with village men.Khalil told me he was here with his family when the Israelis entered the village at 3:30 am. They tried to find a safe place.\"I was in my house with my children. We went from one room to another. They shot at my two daughters. One was hit, and the other died instantly. When I picked her up, I was shot in the hand.\"The dead girl was 17-year-old Hiba Abu Daher, who was shot in the stomach. They sheltered, Khalil said, alongside Hiba's dead body for two hours before they were rescued and taken to hospital.When I visited, Khalil's nine-year-old daughter was lying on a blanket on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hip.Khalil's nine-year-old daughter lying on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hipThe girls' mother, Umm Mohammad, sat with the women of the family, desperately worried about the future.\"We want peace of mind,\" she told me. \"We want to live in our homes, and we want a clinic and medical staff because we don't have one.\"We also want a doctor because there isn't one in Beit Jinn, nor is there a pharmacy. We want security.\"'We go to sleep and wake up afraid'A year after the end of Assad's rule, Syria's new rulers have scored some important achievements. They are still in power, which was not guaranteed when they took Damascus. President Trump has become Sharaa's most important backer. Sanctions are being lifted. The economy is showing signs of life and business deals are being done, including modernising oil and gas installations and privatising the airports in Damascus and Aleppo.But deals that are in the pipeline have not yet changed the lives of most Syrians. The government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individuals. Sectarian tensions are unresolved and could ignite again. The US-mediated dialogue with Israel has stalled.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individualsBenjamin Netanyahu insists that Damascus might demilitarise a large area of southern Syria and shows no signs of ordering the IDF to pull back. Both points amount to a major violation of Syrian sovereignty. The Beit Jinn raid makes it harder for Damascus to offer concessions.Government in Damascus is centred on Sharaa himself, assisted by the foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani and a few trusted associates. No serious attempt seems to be happening to create an accountable framework of government.Syria without the Assad family is a better place. But Umm Mohammad summed up the feelings of far too many Syrians.\"The future is difficult. We have nothing, not even schools. Our children are living in hell here. There is no safety for them. How will we live?\"We want safety. We go to sleep and wake up afraid.\"Top picture credits: AFP via Getty Images and Anadolu via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "1 day agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentBBCRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change.

    "body": "Italian cooking has been awarded special cultural heritage status by the United Nations' cultural agency Unesco. National favourites including pizza are already on Unesco's list of \"intangible cultural heritage\", but now Italian cooking traditions and the way they are practiced and transmitted have been awarded. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has been pushing for her country's cuisine to be recognised since her election, said: \"For us Italians, cuisine is not just food or a collection of recipes. It is so much more: it is culture, tradition, work, wealth.\" For millions of fans the news confirms what they already believed - from Sicilian Cannoli to Calabrian 'Nduja - Italian is the best. The announcement was made during a Unesco assembly meeting in the Indian capital Delhi on Wednesday. The cultural agency described Italian cuisine as a \"means of connecting with family and the community, whether at home, in schools, or through festivals, ceremonies and social gatherings\". Koshary, the spicy dish of lentils, rice, and pasta available at countless Egyptian food stalls, was also added to the list of intangible cultural heritage. Other countries have had their \"practices, skills, traditions and social practices related to foodways\" recognised by Unesco, a spokesperson from the agency told the BBC. Previous examples include \"Washoku, traditional dietary cultures of the Japanese, notably for the celebration of New Year, Breakfast culture in Malaysia: dining experience in a multi-ethnic society, or the Gastronomic meal of the French,\" the spokesperson added. Speaking to La Repubblica, the Rome-based daily newspaper, chef Michelangelo Mammoliti said the news filled him with a great sense of pride both personally as an Italian, as well as professionally as a chef. \"Italy is one of the nations where regional cuisine has a very big impact on culture and traditions,\" said the chef, whose restaurant La Rei Natura in Piedmont is the only new three-star restaurant in the 2026 Michelin Guide. Italy's industry leaders and government ministers will be hoping that the move further boosts tourism to the country, which already welcomes 80 million international visitors annually.Luigi Scordamaglia, CEO of Filiera Italia, which represents all the food and wine companies in the production chain, told Ansa news agency that the move from Unesco marked a success \"for the entire Made in Italy supply chain\". Mr Scordamaglia also spoke about the role of the Mediterranean diet in promoting good health.He added: \"When we talk about the Mediterranean diet, we're talking about our wonderful Italian cuisine, which shares its principles, first and foremost those of balance and variety.\"Swimming pool culture in Iceland; the practice of Cuban Son music and dance; and the art of playing, singing and making the lahuta from Albania also entered Unesco's list of intangible cultural heritage.

    "body": "At least 22 people have been killed and a further 16 injured after two buildings collapsed in the Moroccan city of Fez.The two four-storey residential buildings that came down early on Wednesday morning contained eight families, state media reports, citing local officials.Several Moroccan news outlets report that the buildings - located in the south-westerly Al Massira suburb of the new part of the city - had shown signs of deterioration for several years. An investigation is now under way.Fez, in north-eastern Morocco, is one of the North African nation's oldest cities, with parts dating back to the 8th Century, as well as being its third-most populous.A search and rescue operation is ongoing to find anyone who may still be trapped under the rubble. Footage from the scene shows people and diggers sifting through the debris under the cover of darkness.In one clip, published by news site Akhbarona, a body can be seen being carried away on a stretcher by emergency services.Residents of nearby buildings have been evacuated as a preventative measure, state media reports.Those taken to hospital suffered varying injuries.The public prosecutor's office in Fez said one of the buildings had been empty but that the other had been hosting a celebration for the birth of a child when the incident occurred, state media reports.It has now opened an investigation into the cause and circumstances of the collapse, local media reports. Residents were quick to blame haphazard construction.\"People shouldn't keep building and encroaching on the next building [over],\" one of them, Abdelali, told Hespress, adding that one of the buildings had fallen onto the other.Another, Idris, said the whole incident had occurred in less than two minutes.\"It was a sudden thing,\" he told the news site. \"We were shocked, we couldn't sleep, we ran away from our homes and went outside.\"Fez was among Moroccan cities caught up in youth-led anti-government protests a few months back, with improved housing and infrastructure among demonstrators' demands.The country's housing minister Adib Ben Ibrahim said in January that around 13,700 buildings nationwide were under imminent risk of collapse.Nine were killed when a condemned building collapsed in a different neighbourhood of Fez in May.Prior to that, five people were killed when a house in the old city crumbled in February 2024, following heavy rain and strong winds.",

    "body": "South Korea has lodged a complaint with the Chinese and Russian defence attaches based in the country, a day after their warplanes entered its air defence zone.Seoul said it sent up fighter jets to \"take tactical measures in preparation for any emergencies\" after seven Russian and two Chinese military aircraft \"briefly entered\" the zone on Tuesday, but noted they \"did not violate\" South Korea's airspace.Some countries delineate air identification defence zones, wherein they require foreign planes to identify themselves. These are not part of sovereign airspaces under international law.In March this year, Seoul also deployed fighter jets after several Russian warplanes flew into the zone.The Russian aircraft entered Korea's Air Defense Identification Zone (Kadiz) near Ulleung Island and Dokdo, while the Chinese aircraft entered near Ieodo, a Joint Chiefs of Staff official said, according to South Korean media. Both sides' aircraft then regrouped in the airspace near Japan's Tsushima Island, the official said.\"Our military will actively respond to aircraft activities from neighbouring countries in the Kadiz in compliance with international law,\" South Korea's defence ministry said on Wednesday when lodging the complaint.Both Japan and South Korea have laid claims to the Dokdo island grouping, as has North Korea. Ieodo - a submerged rock above the South Korean island of Jeju - is a point of dispute between Seoul and Beijing, each of whom have included it in their air defence zones.China on Wednesday confirmed that its air force had conducted a joint patrol with Russia in the East China Sea and Western Pacific airspace.The exercise was part of an \"annual cooperation plan\" between Beijing and Moscow to \"address regional challenges and maintain regional peace and stability\", said a national defence spokesman.China and Russia have entered South Korea's air defence zone without notification on several occasions since 2019, often during similar exercises.Russia does not recognise South Korea's air defence zone, describing it as \"unilaterally\" established and saying it should therefore not create any legal obligations for other countries.",

They were ordered to report to the Taliban's \"morality police\" on Sunday, and presented themselves for questioning in Herat the following day.\"They were promoting foreign culture and imitating film actors in Herat,\" Khyber wrote on social media, adding that they had undergone a \"rehabilitation programme\". They were not formally arrested, \"only summoned and advised and released\", Khyber told the BBC's US partner CBS News.\"We have our own religious and cultural values, and especially for clothing we have specific traditional styles,\" he said.\"The clothing they wore has no Afghan identity at all and does not match our culture. Secondly, their actions were an imitation of actors from a British movie. Our society is Muslim; if we are to follow or imitate someone, we should follow our righteous religious predecessors in good and lawful matters.\"The men could be seen thanking officials for their advice and saying they were unaware they had violated any laws in a video released by the ministry after they were questioned - though it is unclear under what circumstances the interview was recorded. \"I have innocently been sharing content that was against Sharia which had many viewers,\" one said in the recording.He said he had been \"summoned and advised\", and would no longer do \"anything like this\".In an interview with YouTube channel Herat-Mic uploaded at the end of November, before they were summoned, the friends said they admired the fashion displayed in the series, adding that they had received positive reactions from locals.\"At first we were hesitant, but once we went outside, people liked our style, stopped us in the streets, and wanted to take photos with us,\" one of the men said, according to a translation by CBS News.",

    "body": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles and ordered the troops be returned to the state governor's control.In June, Trump sent thousands of National Guard troops to the California city in the wake of protests over his administration ramping up immigration raids in Los Angeles. US District Judge Charles Breyer said the Trump administration had not proven that that the city's protests against immigration justified taking federal control of the state's National Guard. The Trump administration still has control over 300 California National Guard troops six months after they were federalised, Judge Breyer said.Breyer also denied the Trump administration's argument that the courts should not weigh in on a president taking control of state National Guard troops during an emergency.\"The Founders designed our government to be a system of checks and balances,\" Judge Breyer wrote in his ruling. \"Defendants, however, make clear that the only check they want is a blank one.\"Judge Breyer said his order would not go into effect until 15 December, giving the Trump administration time to make its expected appeal to a higher court.\"President Trump exercised his lawful authority to deploy National Guard troops to support federal officers and assets following violent riots,\"  said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in a statement to the BBC, adding \"we look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.\"This year, Trump has sent National Guard troops to several cities, including Portland, Oregon, and Washington DC, where the deployments have also been contested in courts and, in some cases, blocked by judges.California Governor Gavin Newsom sued soon after Trump first deployed thousands of troops in June, but a court of appeals sided with the administration, saying the protests in Los Angeles justified Trump's federalisation of the National Guard.Newsom filed a new legal challenge in November, arguing the protests in the city had largely subsided and therefore the troops were no longer necessary.In a hearing in the case on Friday, lawyers for the Trump administration said the troops should stay in LA because federal immigration agents there were still being targeted.But Judge Breyer seemed to question the need for troops to remain in the city months later.\"I think experience teaches us that crises come and crises go,\" he said, according to the Associated Press.In his ruling, Judge Breyer said the Trump administration was \"effectively creating a national police force made up of state troops\" by sending California's National Guard troops to other states as well.Judge Breyer previously ruled that the way Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles this summer was illegal.All 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and several territories have their own contingent of National Guard troops.President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard to several US cities has drawn a round of legal challenges by state and local officials.Trump has argued that his use of the troops is necessary to quell violence in Democratic-controlled cities, crack down on crime and support his deportation initiatives.",

    "body": "The US has asked Thailand and Cambodia to \"cease hostilities immediately\" as border clashes extended for a third day, killing at least 10 people and displacing hundreds of thousands.The two nations must follow de-escalatory measures outlined in a peace accord brokered by US President Donald Trump in October, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.Trump has also said that he would \"make a phone call\" to stop the fighting, which is the most serious escalation since clashes in July killed dozens of people.Both countries have blamed each other for re-igniting the fighting, which has seen air strikes and exchanges of artillery fire.The death toll over three days of hostilities stands at 10 - seven from Cambodia and three from Thailand. Thai officials said they evacuated more than 400,000 people, while Phnom Penh said 100,000 on the Cambodian side have been moved to shelters.Thailand's defence ministry said Wednesday military actions were \"limited in scope and employed as a  last option\". \"Peace must come with the safety and security of our citizens, full stop,\" the ministry's spokesman said.Cambodia on the other hand accused Thailand of launching \"aggressive military attacks\" that targeted civilian institutions and \"sacred cultural sites\", including historic temples along the disputed border.Also on Wednesday, Cambodia announced it was pulling out from the South East Asian Games that is being hosted in Thailand.The Cambodian National Olympic Committee cited \"serious concerns and requests\" from the families of its athletes for the withdrawal. It added that the decision was \"not made lightly\".United Nations' Secretary-General António Guterres urged both sides to \"exercise restraint and avoid further escalation\", noting how their dispute has led to \"significant civilian casualties, damage to civilian infrastructure, and displacement on both sides\".The century-old border dispute between the South East Asian neighbours dramatically escalated on 24 July with a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, followed by Thai air strikes.That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Later that month, Bangkok and Phnom Penh agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Trump - who at the time threatened to stop tariff negotiations until the hostilities stopped.In October, Trump claimed a historic achievement in ending the border conflict after both sides signed a ceasefire agreement, but tensions have continued to simmer.Violence this week has expanded into at least six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and five provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.Thailand and Cambodia have been contesting territorial sovereignty along their 800km land border for more than a century, since the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.This week, several countries, including the UK, US and Japan, have issued warnings against travelling to the border areas citing the renewed fighting.",

    "body": "48 minutes agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoShares of cloud computing giant Oracle plunged more than 10% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company's revenues fell short of Wall Street expectations.The company reported revenue of $16.06bn (£11.99bn) for the three months that ended in November, compared with the $16.21bn projected by analysts.Revenue growth was up 14%, with a 68% surge in sales at its AI business, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), the company said.OCI services major AI technology developers whose demand for Oracle's AI infrastructure helped the company's shares reach new highs this fall but Wednesday's results failed to quell fears about a potential AI bubble.In September, Oracle inked a highly sought-after contract with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI which agreed to purchase $300bn in computing power from Oracle over five years.Oracle chairman and chief technology officer Larry Ellison briefly became the world's richest man in September.Oracle stock has lost 40% of its value since peaking three months ago. Still, shares are up more than a third since the start of the year.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr Ellison struck a cautious tone.\"There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes,\" he wrote.Mr Ellison also appeared to snub Nvidia, the designer of highly-sophisticated AI chips, saying Oracle would buy chips from any maker in order to serve clients.\"We will continue to buy the latest GPUs from Nvidia, but we need to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy,\" Mr Ellison declared in a policy he called \"chip neutrality\".Oracle is involved in multiple AI infrastructure arrangements that have raised the prospect that major players in the sector are participating in 'circular financing' deals whereby companies finance purchases of their own products and services.\"Oracle's earnings arrive as investors weigh whether its massive OpenAI partnership might mean overexposure with a customer currently in the spotlight over profitability concerns,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne following the release of the company's quarterly report.Mr Bourne said Oracle faced mounting scrutiny over the increased debt the company has amassed to fund building data centres.Oracle raised a record $18bn in a massive bond sale in September, one of the largest debt issuances ever in the tech sector.\"Although Oracle's shares are buoyed by its September surge, this revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending,\" Mr Bourne said.The Ellison family, supporters of US President Donald Trump, also recently purchased Paramount and have spearheaded a bid to take over another major Hollywood studio, Warner Brothers Discovery.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAoife WalshWashingtonReutersA federal judge in New York has ruled the US Department of Justice can publicly release grand jury records from Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case. US District Judge Richard Berman's ruling reverses his previous decision to keep the material sealed. He cited a new law passed by Congress requiring the justice department to release files about Epstein.In his latest ruling, Judge Berman said the victims have the right to \"have their identity and privacy protected\", adding that their \"safety and privacy are paramount\".Esptein was charged with sex trafficking in July 2019. He died in a New York prison cell a month later while awaiting trail. Judge Berman in August had denied the justice department's request because of concerns about \"possible threats to victims' safety and privacy\".But in Wednesday's ruling, he said the materials could now be released because of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was signed into law by US President Donald Trump last month.The law requires the justice department to release investigative material related to Epstein by 19 December, including unclassified records, documents and communications.It also allows the department to withhold files that involve active criminal investigations or raise privacy concerns.Judge Berman is the third federal judge to grant similar requests from the justice department since the new law was introduced. On Tuesday, another judge made a similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating Epstein's abuse.During her trial, prosecutors argued Maxwell recruited and groomed girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year sentence. Last Friday, a judge in Florida granted a different request to unseal grand jury transcripts from another investigation into Epstein from 2005 and 2007. Getty ImagesA judge made a similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell on TuesdayThe Trump administration has faced months of pressure over the Epstein files. The president was a friend of Epstein's, but has said they fell out in the early 2000s, years before the disgraced financier was first arrested. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. During the 2024 presidential campaign, he promised to make the files public, and early in the year his administration released thousands of pages of documents from the Epstein investigation – mostly flight logs. However, justice department officials in July said in a memo no further material would be released. That prompted anger from within both parties, and lawmakers introduced a resolution forcing the files' release.Trump, who previously dismissed calls to release the files, signed the bill into law in November marking a major reversal in his position. The family of Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim who died by suicide earlier this year, said Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\".The files which must be made public this month are different to the documents released by the House Oversight Committee, which had subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier in the year.US CongressImages were recently released by a congressional committee showing Epstein's home in the US Virgin IslandsThose documents included images of Jeffrey Epstein's US Virgin Islands home, which showed several bedrooms, a room with masks on a wall and a phone with names written on speed-dial buttons.Multiple survivors have alleged that they were trafficked to and abused on the island, known as Little St James, which Epstein purchased in 1998.The images from 2020 also showed what appeared to be a dental chair, and another room that had a black chalkboard on the wall with the words \"truth\", \"deception\" and \"power\" scrawled across it. The committee's Democratic leader, Robert Garcia, said the material was released to \"ensure public transparency\".Republicans, who are in the majority on the committee, criticised Democrats for releasing selective information in advance and then released a further batch of documents.",

    "body": "13 hours agoMatt MurphyBBC Verify      Getty ImagesTwo US fighter jets were tracked circling the Gulf of Venezuela on Tuesday as tensions continue to escalate between the two countries.The F/A-18 Super Hornets appeared on flight tracking sites near Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city, at around 13:00 (17:00 GMT), before circling the gulf for about 40 minutes.A US defence official told the Associated Press the F/A-18 jets had conducted a \"routine training flight\" in the area.The incident comes amid a wave of US strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea, which the White House said were trafficking drugs to the US from Venezuela. Experts have raised questions over the legality of the strikes, which have killed more than 80 people.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using the strikes to destabilise the country and oust him from power.In an interview conducted with Politico the day before the jets approached Venezuela's coastline, Trump declared that Maduro's days in power were \"numbered\", and declined to comment on whether US troops could be deployed to the country.A separate jet, an EA-18G Growler, also appeared just before the F/A-18s on the tracking site FlightRadar24. Data shows the jet flew loops just north of Venezuela's coast.They are the latest in a number of unusual US air force activities that have been tracked since September. B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers previously flew up to and along the Venezuelan coast.But the F/A-18s, which are capable of engaging targets both on the ground and in the air, appear to be the first to approach the Venezuelan coastline so publicly in recent months. The F/A-18s came within 20 nautical miles of the coastline, flight tracking data showed, but the US official said the jets remained in international airspace. Neither the F/A-18s or the Growler showed a point of origin or a destination on FlightRadar24, and all three aircraft only turned on their transponders when they arrived near the Venezuelan coastline. Justin Crump, head of the risk consultancy Sibylline, suggested the move was intended to \"support the administration's signalling and put pressure on the [Venezuelan] leadership\".The F/A-18s - which operated under the callsigns RHINO11 and RHINO12 - flew six loops up and down the Gulf of Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Growler jet - flying under the codename GRIZZLY2 - also flew circles along the coast. Greg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshal and president of the Air and Space Power Association, told BBC Verify that the flights appeared to be \"probing\" Venezuelan defence and trying to check for responses such as radio traffic and encrypted signals related to defence systems.\"The Growlers would have been listening for [signals intelligence], whilst the Super Hornets would have been providing air defence cover for the Growlers,\" Baswell said. He said the Growlers would also detect \"active missile sites\".\"It could be construed as the early gathering of intelligence for subsequent operations, or just a warning of such,\" he added.Crump said the jets also had the capacity to test out \"jamming capabilities\", adding: \"This also helps send a message, when successful, potentially indicating to Venezuela's leadership that these systems cannot or should not be relied upon,\" he said.The US has deployed troops, ships and jets to the Caribbean in recent months, which officials have said is to combat drug trafficking in the area.On Tuesday the US Southern Command published photos of an F/A-18 operating from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which has been sent to the Caribbean.Analysis of satellite images and ship tracking websites by BBC Verify has made it possible to identify at least nine military vessels that have been deployed to the region over recent weeks.Satellite images also show that an airbase in Puerto Rico, which was closed in 2004 by the Pentagon, has been re-activated. Repairs have been carried out to the runway at Roosevelt Roads base and F-35s - America's most advanced fighter - have been sent to the base.",

    "body": "The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to pioneering elephant conservationist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, who died aged 83 at his home in Nairobi on Monday.Douglas-Hamilton spent his life studying and campaigning to protect African elephants, becoming a world-leading expert on their behaviour in the wild. His groundbreaking research exposed the devastating effects of poaching - often at great risk to his own safety - and was instrumental in the banning of the international ivory trade.Prince William praised the zoologist as \"a man who dedicated his life to conservation and whose life's work leaves lasting impact on our appreciation for, and understanding of, elephants\".\"The memories of spending time in Africa with him will remain with me forever,\" added Prince William, who is a royal patron for the African wildlife conservation charity, Tusk, of which Douglas-Hamilton was an ambassador. \"The world has lost a true conservation legend today, but his extraordinary legacy will continue,\" the charity's founder Charles Mayhew said in a statement.Born in 1942 to an aristocratic British family in Dorset, England, Douglas-Hamilton studied biology and zoology in Scotland and Oxford before moving to Tanzania to research elephant social behaviour.It was there at Lake Manyara National Park that he began documenting every elephant he encountered, eventually becoming so familiar with the herds he could recognise them by the unique shapes of their ears and wrinkles on their skin.\"The thing about elephants is that they have a lot in common with human beings,\" he said in a 2024 documentary about his work, A Life Among Elephants.Friend and fellow conservationist Jane Goodall, who died in October, was featured in the documentary, and said he had shown the world that elephants are capable of feeling just like humans.\"I think his legacy will be one of a man who did so much to help people understand how majestic, how wonderful elephants are, and to learn more about their way of life,\" Goodall said.But that work did not always come easy: he was charged at by elephants, almost killed by a swarm of bees and shot at by poachers. In 2010, a flood destroyed his research facility in Kenya and years of work was lost.Despite the hardships, Douglas-Hamilton remained steadfast in his mission to raise awareness of the plight of African elephants, becoming one of the leading voices to alert the world of the ivory poaching crisis, which he described as \"an elephant holocaust\".He later campaigned for an international ban on the commercial trade in ivory, and in 1989 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species was signed, an international agreement between governments.After the agreement failed to wipe out the trade completely, Douglas-Hamilton turned his attention to China and the US, the two main markets for ivory. Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-US President Barack Obama agreed to a near-total ban on its import and export in 2015.Douglas-Hamilton established Save the Elephants in 1993, a charity dedicated to safeguarding the animals and deepening human understanding of their behaviour.The organisation's CEO Frank Pope, who is also his son-in-law, said: \"Iain changed the future not just for elephants, but for huge numbers of people across the globe. His courage, determination and rigour inspired everyone he met.\"In his own words, Douglas-Hamilton expressed optimism for the future of his life's work.\"I think my greatest hope for the future is that there will be an ethic developed of human-elephant coexistence,\" he once said.Iain Douglas-Hamilton is survived by his wife Oria, children Saba and Dudu, and six grandchildren.",

    "body": "Does Japan's megaquake warning mean the 'big one' is coming?2 days agoShaimaa Khalil,BBC News, TokyoandFlora Drury,BBC News, LondonAFP via Getty ImagesAfter a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck north-eastern Japan on Monday, authorities again warned of the possibility of a future megaquake.It means that thoughts in Japan are turning to the \"big one\" - a once-in-a-century quake.In September, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough  - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - within the next 30 years. In April authorities had warned that a megaquake had the potential to trigger a tsunami of more than 20m (66ft) which could hit parts of Tokyo and other prefectures. They predicted that there would be around 300,000 deaths and trillions of dollars in economic damage.So, what is the \"big one\", can it be predicted - and is it likely to strike any time soon?What did the latest warning say?Officials urged residents in seven prefectures from Hokkaido in the north to Chiba in central Japan to stay on high alert for a potential megaquake.This is a vast area with millions of people.A government official said there was a possibility that \"a large-scale earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or higher could occur as a follow-up earthquake\" in the region.Authorities also told people to check evacuation routes, secure furniture, and prepare emergency kits, including food, water and portable toilets.However, an evacuation order was not issued. Japan's director for disaster management said at a news conference that global earthquake data suggests there's a possibility, not a prediction, of a larger tremor to come.Officials said the possibility of a larger quake occurring is about one in 100. What is a megaquake?APThe last megaquake occured along the Nankai Trough almost 80 years agoJapan is a country used to earthquakes. It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year. The vast majority do little damage, but there are some - like the one which struck in 2011 measuring magnitude 9.0, sending a tsunami into the north-east coast and killing more than 18,000 people.But the one that authorities fear may strike in this more densely populated region to the south could - in the absolute worst-case scenario - be even more deadly.Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough have already been responsible for thousands of deaths. In 1707, a rupture along its entire 600km length caused the second-biggest earthquake ever recorded in Japan and was followed by the eruption of Mount Fuji.The Nankai Trough sits between Suruga Bay, in central Japan, and the Hyuganada Sea in Kyushu to the southThese so-called \"megathrust\" earthquakes tend to strike every hundred years or so, often in pairs: the last ones were in 1944 and 1946.And this long-anticipated event is, according to geologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A Hubbard, \"the original definition of the 'Big One'”.\"The history of great earthquakes at Nankai is convincingly scary\" so as to be concerning, the pair acknowledged in their Earthquake Insights newsletter last year.But can earthquakes actually be predicted?Not according to Robert Geller, professor emeritus of seismology at the University of Tokyo.When authorities issued a megaquake warning last year, after a 7.1 quake struck southern Japan, Prof Geller told the BBC that the warning had \"almost nothing to do with science\".The advisory was \"not a useful piece of information\", he said.This, he argued, is because while earthquakes are known to be a \"clustered phenomenon\", it is \"not possible to tell in advance whether a quake is a foreshock or an aftershock”.Indeed, only about 5% of earthquakes are \"foreshocks\", said Bradley and Hubbard.However, the 2011 earthquake was preceded by a 7.2 magnitude foreshock, they note - one which was largely ignored.The warning system was drawn up after 2011 in an attempt to prevent a disaster of this scale again. August 2024 was the first time the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) used it.Getty ImagesA massive earthquake in 2011 killed more than 18,000 peopleBut, crucially, while it told people to be prepared, it did not tell anyone to evacuate. Indeed, they were keen to play down any massive imminent risk.\"The likelihood of a new major earthquake is higher than normal, but this is not an indication that a major earthquake will definitely occur,\" the JMA said at the time.Additional reporting by Chika Nakayama and Jake Lapham",

    "body": "Elon Musk says he would not lead the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) if he had his time again, but has maintained that its tumultuous efforts to shrink the size of the US government under President Donald Trump was \"a little bit successful\".The billionaire boss of Tesla and SpaceX gave his reflections during a nearly-hour long interview on The Katie Miller Podcast on Tuesday.Musk left Doge in May after initially promising to save as much as $2tn (£1.5tn) a year by slashing federal jobs and shuttering government programmes, among other cost-cutting measures.Doge's website, which was last updated on 4 October, claims to have saved an estimated $214bn so far this year.Conservative podcast host Miller, a former White House adviser herself who worked as a spokesperson for Doge, asked Musk whether he would do his work for the organisation again if he could rewind to the start of the year.\"I mean no, I don't think so,\" Musk replied.Instead, he said he would have \"worked in my companies, essentially\", explaining that \"they wouldn't have been burning the cars\".His comments reference a series of vandalism attacks on Tesla showrooms and vehicles earlier this year, which came in response to the highly visible political role in the Trump administration for the world's richest man.Musk's involvement in US politics sparked global protests and boycotts against Tesla, and led to a spike in vandalism of Tesla's Cybertruck vehicles. In April, the firm said sales had fallen to their lowest level in three years and warned investors that \"changing political sentiment\" could continue to hurt demand.But Musk said he believed Doge had been \"a little bit successful, we were somewhat successful\".\"You really want the least amount done by government as possible,\" he explained, adding that Doge had \"stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense\".Musk told Miller that Doge, which was created by an executive order on Trump's first day back in the White House, was a \"made-up\" name \"based on internet suggestions\". The advisory group, which is not an official government department, tackled Musk's vision at a fierce pace. It pushed for massive reductions in the federal workforce, as well as the shuttering of programmes and even agencies such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Some of Doge's moves were met with legal fights, or were reversed. When the group's cost-cutting resulted in bird flu officials at the US Department of Agriculture being fired, the Trump administration looked to re-hire them days later.Musk's time at the helm of Doge not only appeared to cause issues for his business empire - it also led to an explosive falling-out with the president himself.Musk donated millions of dollars to the Trump campaign during the election and was a fixture at the White House for months, speaking at cabinet meetings and standing behind the president at events in the Oval Office.But that relationship came to a grinding halt in June when Musk broke with the White House narrative and criticised a Trump-backed spending bill. It led to a war of words on social media, with Trump at one point threatening to order Doge to look into Musk's own business dealings with the US government.The pair's relationship now seems to be mended. Musk was spotted at a White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in November.And Musk spoke positively of Trump in his interview with Miller, saying the president was the funniest person he knows and has \"great sense of humour\".",

    "body": "Portugal is facing severe disruption to transport, flights, hospitals, schools and other public services on Thursday, as the two main union federations stage a general strike over unprecedented labour reforms.The last time the CGTP and the generally less militant UGT joined forces was during the eurozone debt crisis in 2013, when a \"troika\" of international institutions demanded cuts in salaries and pensions as part of Portugal's bailout.Twelve years later, Portugal's economy has become the fastest growing in the eurozone in recent months, but Prime Minister Luís Montenegro says it is still necessary to tackle \"rigidities\" in the labour market \"so companies can be more profitable and workers have better salaries\" as a result.\"I will not give up on having a country with the ambition to be at the forefront, to be at the vanguard of Europe,\" he said on the eve of the strike.However, Montenegro appears to have been taken aback by the strength of feeling against his minority right-of-centre government's plans: one of his Social Democrat MPs is on the UGT executive and even he voted for a strike.The prime minister tweaked some proposals after calling the federation in for talks late last month, but it was clearly not enough.Among the most controversial of the more than 100 proposals are:letting employers roll over temporary contracts for years on endlifting a ban on sacking workers then immediately rehiring them indirectly via outsourcingremoving a requirement to reinstate employees who were unfairly dismissed.It is Portuguese in their 20s who are likely to be most affected by the changes - and opinion is rather mixed.Diogo Brito, who works as an air steward but has friends who do casual work in tourism, supports the right to strike but backs the package: \"It has to be done. We have to catch up with richer countries and with these measures I think we can evolve more.\"But self-employed photographer Eduardo Ferreira says he knows many people who already cannot find secure jobs and is pleased to see the unions unite at a \"critical moment\" for Portugal: \"Things have been tough ever since the troika, and workers haven't reacted until now.\"The CGTP has condemned the package as \"an assault on the rights of all workers, particularly women and young people\", while the UGT calls it \"so out of step, in a context of economic growth, financial stability and a strong labour market, that… it reflects a clear bias in favour of employers\".The UGT also complains that formal talks between unions, government and business were \"unbalanced, restrictive and detrimental to workers\".Montenegro's governing coalition lacks a majority in parliament, and is seeking support for the bill not only from the small, free-market Liberal Initiative (IL) but from hard-right Chega, which since May's general election has been the second-largest party. Its leader, André Ventura, has expressed reservations about the way some measures might affect family life, but looks open to negotiations.Before the election, Montenegro had ruled out deals with Chega, and the unions and the third-biggest party, the Socialists, say the prime minister's mask has slipped.They also warn that politicians on the right want to amend Portugal's 1976 constitution to loosen employment safeguards considered among Europe's strongest.The issue has also become caught up in the campaign for January's presidential election, with several candidates arguing that the labour reform bill flouts Portugal's 1976 constitution.Under Portugal's \"semi-presidential\" system, the head of state can decline to sign bills approved by parliament. Bills can instead be sent to the Constitutional Court for review or the president can exercise a veto that, while it can be overturned by a majority of elected MPs, delays the process, ensuring further discussion.With the government seeking to overhaul so much of the labour code, such scrutiny might stoke voter unease about its radicalism, particularly since the plans were not in the coalition's election manifesto.Unlike many strikes here, Thursday's day of action is not limited to the public sector. At Portugal's largest factory, VW-owned Autoeuropa, south of Lisbon, almost 1,000 employees voted unanimously last week to back it.\"I believe there is no worker in this country unaffected by the negative measures in this reform,\" said UGT secretary-general Mário Mourão, after the Autoeuropa gathering. \"It must be responded to appropriately.\"",

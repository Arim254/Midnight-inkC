    "body": "31 minutes agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesTsugaike Kogen Mountain Resort is a popular skiing destination in JapanAn Australian woman has died after becoming trapped in a ski lift at a resort in central Japan, officials have said.The 22-year-old woman had been using a chairlift at Tsugaike Mountain Resort in Otari, Nagano prefecture, when part of her backpack became caught in the lift mechanism, leaving her suspended in midair.The woman then suffered a heart attack and was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead, officials said.The Tsugaike Mountain Resort and Tsugaike Gondola Lift Co issued a joint apology and said an investigation had been launched into the incident, which occurred around 09:00 local time (0:00 GMT) on Friday. The resort's chief executive Tsuneo Kubo expressed his \"deepest condolences to the bereaved family\" and said safety measures would be strengthened.He said in a statement that an unfastened buckle on the woman's backpack had become hooked to the chair while the bag's chest strap was still fastened, causing her to be dragged along with it after trying to disembark.The lift was stopped by an attendant who pressed the emergency button, after which first aid was administered and the woman was transported to hospital by ambulance, Kubo added.The accident took place at the top of the two-person Tsuga No.2 Pair Lift. The woman had been riding the lift with another person, police told local media.The lift operator said it was co-operating with police and other authorities as the cause of the accident was investigated and safety procedures reviewed.\"We will take concrete measures to prevent recurrence,\" Kubo said. \"We take this situation very seriously and will strive to operate the ski resort in a safe manner so that our customers can use it with peace of mind.\"Police are questioning resort staff and inspecting the lift equipment as part of their inquiry, according to local media.Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that one of its citizens had died in Japan and said it was providing consular assistance to the family.\"We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time. Owing to our privacy obligations we are unable to provide further comment,\" a spokesperson said.",

    "body": "3 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America online editorReutersLaura Fernández sailed to victory in the first round with no need for a run-offThe candidate for the governing conservative Sovereign People's Party, Laura Fernández, has won the presidential election in Costa Rica. With more than 88% of the votes counted, Fernández had over 48% of the votes, far ahead of the second-placed centrist candidate, Álvaro Ramos, who conceded defeat.Fernández ran on a promise to deepen the tough-on-crime approach of the outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves, who had handpicked her as his successor. Voters had said they were concerned about a surge in drug-related violence in the Central American country. The size of her vote share - which exceeded the 40% needed to win outright in the first round - means that there is no need for a run-off.Fernández will be sworn in on 8 May.In her victory speech, the 39-year-old said she would plough ahead with the policies introduced by Chaves, whose chief of staff she was.Under Costa Rica's constitution, presidents are not allowed to serve two consecutive terms and Chaves was therefore barred from standing for re-election. Fernández has hinted she may appoint him to a post in her cabinet. Costa Rica, one of Central America's safest countries and a stable democracy, has seen a rise in crime over the past years as transnational criminal gangs have expanded in the region.On the campaign trail, Fernández said she would emulate some of the policies of the El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele.Bukele has sky-high approval ratings with Salvadoreans saying they are grateful for his iron-fist approach to crime, which has seen the murder rate plummet.Fernández has said she will declare a state of emergency in areas where gangs hold sway and finish the construction of a high-security jail similar to the Cecot prison in El Salvador.Addressing concerns by her critics that her policies could erode the rights of citizens, Fernández declared in her victory speech that her government would be one of \"dialogue and national harmony, respectful and firmly based in the rule of law\".She did however strike a combative note too, criticising the opposition for its \"obstruction and sabotage\" in a reference to the challenges Chaves faced getting some of his policies approved in parliament, which was dominated by opposition lawmakers.With her party winning 30 out of the 57 seats in parliament, Fernández is expected to have more backing in the legislature than her predecessor in office.ReutersBefore running for the presidency, the 39-year-old served as planning minister as well as in other posts.But above all, she is seen as the heir to Chaves, whose direct and sometimes confrontational style she shares.She is also expected to maintain the close ties her predecessor built with the US.Chaves signed a \"safe third-country migrant agreement\" with the US, which means the Trump administration can deport migrants from countries other than Costa Rica to the Central American nation.The agreement allows the US to remove migrants from countries deemed unsafe to a third country considered safe. The Trump administration has described Costa Rica as a \"key global cocaine transshipment point\", adding that is had \"become an increasingly significant waypoint for criminal organisations trafficking cocaine\" to the US.Fernández has said she would be would be willing to declare a state of emergency - and lift some of citizens' rights - if organised crime where to further take hold in certain areas. She will become the second woman to govern the Central American nation after Laura Chinchilla, who was elected president in 2010.",

    "body": "9 hours agoKoh EweCCTVA Guangdong court convicted more than 20 of the Bai family's members and associates of fraud, homicide and injuryChina has executed four members of the Bai family mafia, one of the notorious dynasties that ran scam centres in Myanmar, state media report.They were among 21 of the family's members and associates who were convicted of fraud, homicide, injury and other crimes by a court in Guangdong province.Last November the court sentenced five of them to death including the clan's patriarch Bai Suocheng, who died of illness after his conviction, state media reported.For years, the Bais, Mings and several other families dominated Myanmar's border town of Laukkaing, where they ran casinos, red-light districts and cyberscam operations.Among the clans, the Bais were \"number one\", Bai Suocheng's son previously told state media after he was detained.The Bais, who controlled their own militia, established 41 compounds to house cyberscam activities and casinos, authorities said. Within the walls of those compounds was a culture of violence, where beatings and torture were routine. The Bai family's criminal activities led to the deaths of six Chinese citizens, the suicide of one person and multiple injuries, the court said.The Bais rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing - who now leads Myanmar's military government.The military leader had been looking for co-operative allies, and Bai Suocheng - then a deputy of the warlord - fitted the bill.But the families' empires crashed in 2023, when Beijing became frustrated by the Myanmar military's inaction on the scam operations and tacitly backed an offensive by ethnic insurgents in the area, which marked a turning point in Myanmar's civil war.That led to the capture of the scam mafias and their members were handed to Beijing. In China, they became subjects of state documentaries which emphasised Chinese authorities' resolve to eradicate the scam networks. With these recent executions Beijing appears to be sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers. Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the United Nations.Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese as well.",

There are no suggestions he ever visited Epstein's private island and he has not been accused of any crime by Epstein's victims.  The US justice department has said allegations about him are unfounded and false.Trump responded to Noah's joke by saying he would be \"sending my lawyers to sue\". Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!!\"I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.\"Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.\"He added: \"Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!\"Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor.He had purchased his private island in 1998. Multiple survivors have alleged that they were trafficked there and abused. Trump has engaged in legal action with multiple media organisations in recent years, including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.In December, he filed a multi-billion dollar lawsuit in a Florida court accusing the BBC of defamation and of violating a trade practices law over the editing of a Panorama programme.Noah is a South African-born comedian who hosted The Daily Show on Comedy Central in the US for seven years.

    "body": "19 hours agoHenri AstierWikipedia CommonsJavier Tarazona was arrested in July 2021 - photo Juanjoseco123, Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 4.0Prominent Venezuelan rights activist Javier Tarazona has been freed, in the latest prisoner release announced by the government amid US pressure for reforms.Tarazona, the head of human rights NGO Fundaredes, was arrested in 2021 and detained in the notorious El Helicoide prison in the capital Caracas. His release was announced on Sunday by Fundaredes.Foro Penal, another Venezuelan rights group, said it had verified the liberation of more than 300 political prisoners since 8 January.On Friday acting President, Delcy Rodríguez said the government would introduce an amnesty law that is expected to benefit hundreds of political prisoners. Under the bill, El Helicoide is also due to be closed.In its statement on Sunday, Fundaredes said Tarazona had been jailed \"for defending human rights, denouncing abuses, and speaking out\".It added that his release did not \"erase the injustice he suffered\", but represented \"a necessary step in a process marked by criminalisation, persecution, and a lack of due process\".Tarazona had alleged that government officials had links with guerrillas in Colombia, with which Venezuela has a 2,000km (1,200-mile) border. The government accused him of treason, terrorism and incitement to hatred.Maduro's dramatic capture by US special forces on 3 January has encouraged families of opposition and human rights figures arrested under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez to step up their campaign for releases.Venezuela has long denied holding political prisoners, but families and rights advocates have demanded charges against detainees be dropped. Opposition politicians, journalists, and activists have faced charges including terrorism and treason, which their families describe as arbitrary.The amnesty bill announced by Rodríguez is expected to be approved by the National Assembly in the coming days. Its aim, the acting president said, is to \"heal the wounds of political confrontation, violence, and extremism\".Foro Penal has said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped.This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group added.",

    "body": "38 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloCorbis via Getty ImagesCrown Princess Mette-Marit said she regretted having any contact with Epstein at allNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has said he agrees with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's admission of \"poor judgement\" after it emerged she had extensive contacts with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The princess features hundreds of times between 2011-14 in the latest files released by the US Department of Justice relating to Epstein.This latest embarrassment for the royal family comes on the eve of her son's seven-week trial in Oslo on 38 charges including rape and assault.Princess Mette-Marit married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon as a commoner when her son Marius Borg Høiby was four and is in line to become queen when her husband accedes to the throne.As the content of her email exchanges began to emerge, the princess released a statement on Saturday saying: \"I showed poor judgement and regret having any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.\" She went on to express her \"deep sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the abuses committed by Jeffrey Epstein\".Although the prime minister did not go further than agreeing with the princess's admission of poor judgement, his implicit criticism of her is considered unusual.  Støre said he also believed that ex-Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland had exercised \"poor judgement\", after it emerged that he had planned a family holiday on Epstein's private island, though he then cancelled it. Jagland was expected to make a statement on the issue on Monday.The latest cache of Epstein files suggests that the correspondence between Princess Mette-Marit and Epstein began in autumn 2011. The warm nature of the messages has appalled commentators in Norway. An email from the HRH Crown Princess account on 23 October 2011 implies she had by then become aware of his initial jail term in 2008. \"Googled u after last email,\" she wrote. \"Agree didn't look too good.\"By this time, Epstein was a registered sex offender.It also emerged that the crown princess spent four days at Epstein's house in Palm Beach, Miami in January 2013, when he was not present.In one email, Epstein was asked whether a mother should suggest naked women carrying a surfboard for her son's wallpaper.US Department of JusticeNorway's royal family has been buffeted by a succession of scandals of late, including the marriage of the crown prince's sister, Princess Märtha Louise to a self-styled American shaman.But the latest revelations concern the future queen of Norway, and the wider monarchy. Princess Mette-Marit is patron of several organisations including the Red Cross.Norwegians are already preparing for the trial of her son, Marius Borg Høiby, and questions are being asked about his mother's failure to realise the toxic nature of maintaining contact with Epstein, and especially the role of her advisers.Her 29-year-old son, who is not part of the royal family, denies the most serious charges against him. One charge of rape involves intercourse while a woman was asleep. Three others allege sexual assault while women were incapacitated, which also counts as rape in Norway.If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in prison.No member of the royal family will attend the trial, which starts at Oslo district court on Tuesday. However, in an emotional statement to reporters last week, Crown Prince Haakon said \"our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by this case... we understand that this is a difficult time for many of you, and we sympathise\".Although his stepson was not a member of the royal family, he said: \"We care about him, and he is an important member of our family.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterThe Kennedy Center in Washington DC will be closed for a two-year renovation beginning in July, US President Donald Trump has announced.Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday that the centre would close on 4 July this year \"in honour of the 250th Anniversary of our Country\". The move follows several artists cancelling performances at the storied institution after it was recently renamed as the Trump Kennedy Center.Shortly after taking office, the president fired several of the board members at the centre and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board.The new board renamed the institution the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in December. New signage appeared on the building's exterior the following day.Several musical acts, including Wicked composer Steven Schwartz and a group called Doug Varone and the Dancers, cancelled performances at the centre in the following weeks because of the name change. On Thursday, the venue hosted a premiere screening of a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump.The US president said there would be a \"scheduled grand reopening\" of the facility and that the renovations had already been financed. \"I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for construction, revitalisation, and complete rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest performing arts facility of its kind, anywhere in the world,\" he wrote.\"In other words, if we don't close, the quality of construction will not be nearly as good, and the time to completion, because of interruptions with Audiences from the many events using the facility, will be much longer.\"Trump had lambasted the physical state of the centre and had worked with the US Congress to allocate more than $250m (£182m) to rebuild it, one of many renovation projects he has taken on in his second term. Some US lawmakers and legal scholars have argued that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, Congress must have a say on any name change.Last December, Democratic US Representative Joyce Beatty filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name for that reason. Some members of President John F Kennedy's family have also denounced the move. The centre was named in Kennedy's memory shortly after his assassination.Joe Kennedy III, a former US House of Representatives member and grandnephew of the late president, said the venue was \"a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoMadeline HalpertNew YorkAFP via Getty ImagesThe partial US government shutdown entered its third day on Monday without resolution as Democrats continued to demand immigration reforms as part of any funding deal to reopen the government.Senate Democrats and Republicans agreed to a package of five spending bills on Thursday, but stripped out a sixth bill on full fiscal year funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The Senate instead approved a two-week funding for the DHS that gives lawmakers more time to work out disputes over its long-term budget.Democrats want changes to the immigration enforcement operation, including requiring agents to wear body cameras turned on and to not wear masks.The package approved by the Senate must now be cleared by the House of Representatives before it is sent to President Donald Trump's desk for signature.The Senate package includes funding for the defence department, the health department, the treasury, the federal court system and other agencies until the end of the 2026 fiscal year on 30 September.But funding for these federal agencies ended at midnight on Saturday, resulting in a partial shutdown, as the House is yet to approve it. The effects will be minimal though, as many government services do not operate over the weekend.The House Rules Committee is expected to meet on Monday afternoon to consider the funding package.The Senate-approved package must first clear a procedural hurdle known as the rule vote, which Democrats are expected to vote against.Speaking to NBC News on Sunday, California Democratic Representative Ro Khanna said he was advocating for his colleagues to vote no on the DHS stopgap funding. \"I just don't see how in good conscience Democrats can vote for continuing ICE funding when they're killing American citizens,\" he said. Yet Republican leaders said they were confident they could pass all the bills soon. \"We'll get this done by Tuesday, I'm convinced,\" said Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Fox News Sunday. The Republican leader told NBC that a winter storm could make it difficult to get lawmakers back in town to vote, and Republicans only have a one-vote majority in the House.The impasse comes as thousands of people have taken to the streets in Minneapolis, to protest against Operation Metro Surge - a Trump administration immigration enforcement effort that has drawn widespread outrage after federal agents fatally shot two US citizens.Democrats have demanded changes in funding to DHS in light of the fatal shootings, and have advocated for changes to ICE protocol such as banning agents' use of masks and having stricter warrant requirements. The DHS is a sprawling department encompassing multiple agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Coast Guard and Secret Service.Thousands of federal agents from ICE and CBP have been deployed to Minnesota as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.",

    "body": "1 day agoJaroslav LukivEPAAttackers struck cities across Balochistan including the provincial capital QuettaA series of gun and bomb attacks across Pakistan's south-western Balochistan province have killed 31 civilians and 17 security service personnel, the region's Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti says.Security forces responding to the violence killed at least 145 attackers during a 40-hour gun battle, he said. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group had earlier said it was behind the attacks, claiming dozens of soldiers were killed.It marks an escalation of violence in the impoverished but resource-rich province, where Pakistan's government has been battling an ethnic insurgency for decades.Pakistan accused India of supporting the BLA. Delhi has repeatedly denied such accusations.Grenade and gun attacks in the provincial capital Quetta and cities and towns across the province targeted hospitals, schools, banks and markets, Pakistan's junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry said.\"In each case, the attackers came in dressed as civilians and indiscriminately targeted ordinary people working in shops,\" he said, adding that the attackers had used civilians as human shields.Armed attackers also opened fire at security installations, attempted to carry out suicide bombings and briefly blocked roads in urban areas.Some key administrative buildings in Quetta and nearby roads were reported to have been sealed off during the day. Mobile phone services were jammed, and regional train services were suspended.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later praised the military, pledging to \"continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication\".The BLA said it had launched a coordinated operation dubbed Herof, or \"black storm\" against security forces, and claimed to have killed 84 members of the security forces and kidnapped a further 18. The claim has not been independently verified and the Pakistani military has not commented.The BLA accuses Pakistan's federal government of exploiting the rich mineral resources of its largest province without the local population benefiting. Local activists also blame Pakistani security forces for enforced disappearances, which Islamabad denies.Balochistan covers nearly 44% of the country's total land, sharing a volatile border with Iran and Afghanistan and covering part of the Arabian Sea coastline. It is home to about 5% of the country's more than 240 million people. The province is also the richest in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals. The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which is the largest ethnic group there. Resistance against the Pakistani government and an insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan gained independence from the British Empire.",

    "body": "6 hours agoMaia DaviesArmed Forces of Ukraine/TelegramThe miners were travelling in a bus when it was hit by a drone, officials sayTwelve miners have been killed by a Russian drone strike in eastern Ukraine, the country's largest private energy firm has said.DTEK said a bus carrying workers after a shift in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region had been targeted in Sunday's attack. At least 15 people were injured, state emergency services said.Earlier, at least two others were killed and nine injured in separate Russian attacks overnight and on Sunday, including six people who were hurt when a drone hit a maternity hospital in Zaporizhzhia.The strikes come while Russia had agreed not to target population centres and energy infrastructure for the duration of a cold snap.Strikes have continued in regions of Ukraine near the front line but cities like the capital, Kyiv, have largely been untouched over the past few days.Moscow did not mention the cold weather when confirming the move, instead saying it was to facilitate peace negotiations due to be held in Abu Dhabi this week.Zaporizhzhia regional head Ivan Fedorov called the hit on the maternity hospital - which occurred as two women were giving birth - further \"proof of a war directed against life\" in a post on Telegram.BBC Verify confirmed the site was Maternity Hospital No.3 on Bocharova Street in the east of the city.Footage shared across social media carried the watermarks of national and local administrations and showed offices, rooms with beds for patients, and a children's room with the windows broken and covered in debris. Some footage showed degrees of fire damage, while two videos showed a fire still burning on the first storey. Another showed fire fighters breaking down interior doors and ferrying patients away.EPAA woman gathers her belongings from a room in the maternity hospital after the strikeReutersNo deaths were reported after the strike at the hospital on SundayUkrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said the hospital attack showed Russian President Vladimir Putin was pursuing a \"war against civilians contrary to peace efforts\".Fedorov later reported three people had been injured by a separate strike in a residential area.After the strike on the DTEK bus in the town of Ternivka, the company said 15 miners had been killed. It later revised the death toll down to at least 12.Elsewhere, a man and a woman were killed by a drone strike in the central city of Dnipro, Ganzha said. He also reported that a 72-year-old man had been injured in Nikopol.Separately, a 59-year-old woman was seriously wounded by shelling in Kherson, while three others were injured in a strike in Kharkiv, officials said.Moscow launched a wave of targeted attacks on Ukraine's power grid in January, leaving millions without heating or electricity during an extraordinarily cold winter - with temperatures forecast to plunge below -20C in places.US President Donald Trump had said on Thursday that Putin had agreed to halt aerial attacks on towns and cities including Kyiv during the cold snap. The Kremlin later said the pause would expire on Sunday.Also on Sunday, Ukraine said it was working with Elon Musk's SpaceX to stop Moscow using the firm's Starlink satellite system for drone attacks.Kyiv's military relies on the system for internet connection, but said this week it had found Starlink terminals on long-range drones used by Russia.Musk said steps to stop the \"unauthorised\" use appeared to have worked, while Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov thanked him for being \"a true friend of the Ukrainian people\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a second round of three-way talks to end the fighting - nearly four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine - would take place on Wednesday and Thursday, rather than Sunday as had been planned.He earlier said the talks in the United Arab Emirates between Russian, Ukrainian and US officials may have to be postponed due to ongoing tensions between the US and Iran.Negotiations on a peace plan have for months been mediated by the US, with a key sticking point being Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.Moscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine, including most of the eastern Donbas region. It wants Kyiv to hand over the areas of the Donbas it has not yet taken by force, while Ukraine reportedly wants Russia to hand back control of its largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia.Additional reporting by Richard Irvine-Brown, BBC Verify",

    "body": "1 hour agoMadina MaishanuBBC Africa, AbujaBBCThe chairs strewn across the floor of one of the churches raided last month hints at the panic the attack caused Dozens of worshippers kidnapped by gunmen in Nigeria's northern Kaduna state have returned home weeks after their abduction, police have confirmed.They were among 177 people seized last month from three churches in the remote village of Kurmin Wali.The 80 people escaped on the day they were taken but hid in neighbouring villages for a fortnight \"due to fear of being captured again\", state police spokesman Mansur Hassan told the BBC.The authorities say efforts are ongoing to secure the release of the remaining 86 people still being held. The attack was part of a wave of kidnappings for ransom affecting many parts of Nigeria, but no group has said it was behind the abductions.The raid was initially denied by police, who only confirmed the kidnappings on 21 January after local residents had reported to the BBC that 177 worshippers were abducted, with 11 escaping shortly afterwards.The official response drew criticism from Amnesty International, which accused Nigerian authorities of \"desperate denial\".The rights group urged officials to \"take immediate and concrete measures to prevent rampant abductions that are gradually becoming the norm in Nigeria.\"In November, more than 300 students and teachers were taken from a Catholic school in Niger state, which neighbours Kaduna, before being released in two groups.Nigeria faces multiple, overlapping security challenges beyond kidnappings, including an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and frequent clashes between herders and farmers in central regions over land and water.Security experts say efforts to tackle these crises are hampered by corruption, poor intelligence sharing, and underfunded local police forces.The security situation has drawn international attention. In December, the US conducted airstrikes in north-western Nigeria on Christmas Day, targeting two camps run by an Islamist militant group.Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is home to more than 250 ethnic groups and is roughly divided between a predominantly Muslim north and a largely Christian south, with significant mixing in central regions. The government maintains that people of all faiths have been victims of the widespread violence.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "34 minutes agoGrace Eliza GoodwinX / Congresswoman Ilan OmarFive-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias are back in MinnesotaA five-year-old boy and his father who were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minnesota have returned home, a US congressman has said.Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat, announced on Sunday that Liam Conejo Ramos and his father Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias had been released from a detention centre in Dilley, Texas and had travelled back to Minneapolis.\"Liam is now home. With his hat and his backpack,\" Castro said.The detainment of the pair sparked protests outside the detention facility where they were being held and led to a national outcry. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement: \"ICE did NOT target or arrest a child.\"Their return home came after US District Judge Fred Biery granted an emergency request from the family's lawyer and ordered their release on Saturday. The judge condemned their detention as driven by a \"perfidious lust for unbridled power\".\"The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children,\" Biery wrote in his ruling.Biery, an appointee of former US President Bill Clinton, said deportations through the US immigration system should occur in a more orderly and humane way than what was currently policy.While the father and son were still in the Texas detention centre, Castro had  written on social media that the young boy was not doing well being away from his family, classmates and home.  The DHS has said the pair entered the US illegally, while a lawyer for the family said they followed proper protocols to seek asylum.On Sunday, the DHS said in a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS News: \"The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and common sense to our immigration system, and will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country.\"Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Democrat and outspoken critic of ICE, also posted on social media about the father and son's return to Minnesota. \"Liam is home now and we are grateful to [Joaquin Castro] for traveling to Minneapolis with him and his dad,\" she wrote. \"Welcome home Liam.\"Just after Ramos and his son left the Texas detention centre, DHS said \"all movement\" at the centre had been halted after medical staff confirmed two detainees had \"active measles infections\".There have been conflicting reports about what happened during the ICE operation in which Ramos was first approached by ICE agents.Officials at the school Ramos attended have said the boy had just arrived home from pre-school when an ICE agent asked the child to knock on the door of the home to see if anyone else was there.A school official said another adult living in the home asked to take the young boy inside, but was refused.School board member Mary Granlund said she was at the scene and told immigration officials she could take Ramos, but they still detained him.ICE denied the child had been detained in a post on X.\"A criminal illegal alien ABANDONED his child as he fled from ICE officers, and our officers ensured the child was kept SAFE in the bitter cold,\" the agency said.\"ICE made multiple attempts to get the family inside the house to take custody of the child. They refused to accept custody of the child. The father told officers he wanted the child to remain with him,\" the agency said.US Vice-President JD Vance told reporters that ICE had no choice because \"the father ran\".Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, said the father and son \"did everything right\" when they came into the country from Ecuador in 2024.They entered the US at a port of entry to seek asylum, they used the CBP One app, they made an appointment, they presented themselves to Customs and Border Protection, and they had shared all their information with the government, Prokosch said.\"This family was not eluding ICE in any way. They were following all the established protocols pursuing their claim for asylum, showing up for their court hearings and pose no safety, no flight risk, and never should have been detained,\" he added.",

    "body": "1 day agoAleks PhillipsUS Department of JusticeThe director of the new documentary on US First Lady Melania Trump has appeared embracing a young woman in images released by the US Department of Justice on Friday.Brett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.When the images were taken remains unclear, though they appear to have been taken in the same location as photos of Ratner and Epstein alongside the late French modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel that were released in December.There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment.The newly released images were part of a tranche of millions of files relating to the late sex offender, who died in custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.A series of thumbnails of the picture collection shows Ratner, Epstein and Brunel smiling and relaxing with different women, all of whose identities have been concealed.The law that led to the files' release mandates that they be redacted to protect victims or ongoing investigations - though a lawyer representing many of them has said the identities of numerous survivors were disclosed in the drop.The files were released the same day as Melania: 20 Days to History, a behind-the-scenes look at the first lady's life in the days leading up to her husband's January 2025 inauguration.It is Ratner's first project since he was accused of sexual misconduct at the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017. Ratner has denied the allegations.He had been under investigation on suspicion of the rape of minors and trafficking of minors for sexual exploitation. Prosecutors suspected him of transporting young women for Epstein.",

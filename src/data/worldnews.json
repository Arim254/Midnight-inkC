    "body": "Murder and MI5: How an extraordinary battle erupted over what the state keeps secret3 days agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent BBCPaul Thompson was shot dead while being driven home in a taxi through Belfast in April 1994. He was murdered in a sectarian attack by loyalist paramilitaries who had set out to kill Catholics.The taxi driver was a friend who was collecting a fare at another address in the Springfield Park area in the west of the city. But no one at the address had rung the taxi firm. The call is suspected to have been a deliberate decoy by the killers who wanted to lure a taxi as prey. Paul was not specifically targeted. They could not have known he would ask for a lift or be in the area.One resident described hearing a heavy burst of gunfire after 23:00, running to the car and finding Paul.Members of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killing. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the group repeatedly murdered Catholic civilians like Paul.Family Handout/PA WireMembers of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for killing Paul, who was nicknamed TopperOn the morning of the day that Paul was killed, locals had told police about a hole in a barrier – known as the 'Peace Line' – which separated the largely Catholic Springfield Park area from a largely Protestant neighbouring area. The residents were concerned the breach could give loyalist paramilitaries access to launch an attack.The hole was not fixed. After the murder, those responsible escaped through it.An inquest into Paul's death was opened in 1995 but never concluded. No-one has ever been held to account. There has never been a full investigation.Left by themselves to fight for answers, his mother Margaret and brother Eugene, both now dead, came to suspect collusion between British security forces and informants – meaning state agents - in the group responsible.In 2024, a coroner decided to release to the family a summary of secret information held by the police. This was said by the coroner to be of central relevance to the case and the police supported the move. But the British government and MI5 argued this would prejudice national security and mounted a legal challenge.PA MediaPaul Thompson was killed by the UDA, which used the cover name of the Ulster Freedom FightersThe case, which centred on who had the power to decide to release the information, reached the Supreme Court last summer, with Paul Thompson's brother, Eugene, tuning in to hearings from a hospice, as he neared death from cancer.The case is widely viewed as a major test of the state's policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) information involving national security.Who decides what is secret?The NCND policy is a position adopted by the government and security services when responding to questions about sensitive matters. It means there will be no confirmation, no denial, and no acknowledgement that the information requested is true, false, or even exists.Eugene Thompson's barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes KC, said the family had concluded the murder happened because the authorities were colluding with the \"very group that actually perpetrated the killing\". She said Eugene was \"trying to find out why his younger brother was murdered\" and felt a \"deep responsibility\".PA MediaEugene Thompson, who has since died, spent years trying to find out the truth about his brother's deathEugene, she added, believed the public should be able to trust that those who kill will be held accountable, especially when they are agents of the state. She asked the judges not to let the NCND policy be used to \"conceal the involvement of state parties in the killing of an ordinary citizen\".Just before Christmas, the court ruled that the government's assessment of damage to national security \"should have been accepted by the coroner\" unless it was plainly irrational or there was no supporting evidence.The justices found the coroner had failed to understand it was \"solely\" for the government to make submissions on national security, not the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, who had argued for the release of the summary of police files.PA WireJon Boutcher argued for the release of the summary of police filesPaul Thompson's case is part of a battle over the truth and whether it can be told. The battle concerns official secrets, often connected to state agents, and it pits bereaved families and senior police officers against the government and the security service, MI5.It raises a profound question: can the state, especially when it is implicated in killing, be trusted as the arbiter of what should remain secret?The spycatcher who was himself a spyOther cases in the coming months will force these issues further into the spotlight – and they come at a time when MI5's integrity is under significant scrutiny.Yet the Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case creates a precedent that says the government and MI5 can withhold information from bereaved families, for national security reasons, even when the police want it to be disclosed.Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, described it as a \"grim day for truth\" and part of a pattern of \"national security being used as a shield to cover up and conceal the state's role in very serious crimes such as murder and other serious human rights violations.\"The government, by contrast, welcomed the court's \"unanimous judgment\".\"This is a highly complex case with wide-ranging implications,\" it said. \"The government will therefore take time to fully consider all aspects of this judgment.\"The Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case has created a precedentDuring the Troubles, the state made widespread use of informants, otherwise known as agents, who were tasked with carrying out actions and often paid. Agents existed in the IRA and in loyalist paramilitary groups. They were run by the police, the army, and MI5.The former Met Police chief Lord Stevens, who led UK government-commissioned investigations into collusion in Northern Ireland between the 1980s and 2000s, once said that of 210 people arrested during his enquiries, only three were not state agents.Collusion occurred in a number of ways, he said, ranging from the state withholding intelligence and evidence from investigators, to state agents being involved in murder. In some cases agents told the authorities in advance about planned attacks but nothing was done to stop them.One of the most notorious agents was codenamed Stakeknife. It has been publicly known for more than 20 years that Stakeknife was a man called Freddie Scappaticci. He died under MI5 protection in 2023 having never been charged with any of the many murders and other crimes to which he is linked.Pacemaker Press/ PAFreddie Scappaticci, or Stakeknife, died under MI5 protection in 2023Scappaticci was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit, which was tasked by IRA leaders with identifying and killing British agents in the organisation. But, with the spycatcher himself a spy, the result was one British agent killing other agents, or people accused of being agents, and the state repeatedly not intervening to save them.Intelligence agencies and historic wrongdoingA long-running police investigation into Stakeknife, Operation Kenova, was forbidden from officially naming Scappaticci in its final report, published in December, despite the fact that his identity was widely known.The head of the Kenova team, Sir Iain Livingstone, pleaded with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn for the right to name Scappaticci in his report, but Benn said he would decide after the Supreme Court ruling in the Paul Thompson case, which came later in December.That ruling has, in effect, strengthened Benn's power to stop him being named. If permission is granted, a revised version of the Kenova report can be published.Jon Boutcher, who was Livingstone's predecessor leading the Kenova investigation, has described the situation preventing Scappaticci being named as a \"pantomime\". It leads to the truth being \"suppressed,\" he argues, with \"profound and severe adverse impacts on victims and families, legitimate public discussion and debate, media freedom, open justice and public confidence in state agencies and the criminal justice system\".PA WireThe integrity of MI5, which is currently led by Sir Ken McCallum, is under scrutinyBoutcher, the PSNI chief constable, is involved in a significant and extraordinary stand-off with the government and MI5 over NCND.He has called for reform of the policy, a principle he fully supports but believes is being wrongly applied and has become a dogma that can be used to conceal wrongdoing.He has recommended the policy is reviewed to ensure it is applied proportionately and only where genuinely necessary for the protection of life or national security. The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy.Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened.\"I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing.\"More from InDepthIn the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being \"thoroughly disingenuous\" and that \"politics is being played with national security\". He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.Trust, state secrecy and the publicBoutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife. Scappaticci was engaged in a pretence to help shore up his reputation: publicly fighting a legal case, while hoping – and expecting – he would lose.VCG via Getty ImagesMany families of those killed or injured in the Troubles are still fighting through the courtsHowever, the government feared Scappaticci would win because a judge would assume he was not Stakeknife and force ministers to be honest.Jon Boutcher has now confirmed an extraordinary fact: the judge who heard the case did so after being secretly briefed on the real identity of Stakeknife.That judge, the then Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord Carswell, ultimately allowed the government to maintain NCND, creating the legal precedent on the policy.\"The full facts about this and the government's explanation will never be known while it is able to hide behind the shield of NCND,\" Boutcher has said.There is a second extraordinary fact: the government barrister who did the secret briefing was Philip Sales, who as Lord Sales was one of the Supreme Court justices in the Paul Thompson case. This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware.This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role.I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case.In a statement, the court said: \"Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court.\"A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none.\"The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean BrownTwo further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court.Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police.The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR.Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary \"the final say\" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body.The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The lead respondent in the case is Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was killed in 1997.PA WireMartina Dillon's husband Seamus was killed in 1997 by the paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)The paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility. A coroner had opened an inquest on the basis there was evidence of collusion by state authorities, but the inquest was halted by the Legacy Act. No-one has ever been held accountable.The government has also registered an appeal in another key case.Sean Brown was also murdered in 1997 by members of the LVF. The 61-year-old father-of-six was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports club in County Londonderry. There were investigative failures by police and no-one has been brought to justice.PA MediaSean Brown, a father of six, was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports clubDecades later, a coroner issued a summary of secret material stating that \"a number of the individuals linked through intelligence to the murder were agents of the state.\" Sean's family want a public inquiry, and have won judgments over the past two years at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The government, which was found to have acted unlawfully by refusing a public inquiry, has registered an appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the issue has constitutional significance regarding who should order inquiries.'The state viewed itself as above the law'At its heart, this vast battle over secrecy centres on two core claims by the state: that only the government and MI5 can ultimately be fully trusted on national security, and that their decisions on what information to release are solely about protecting the public.But these claims have been undermined by MI5's actions and omissions in several recent cases, all during the leadership of MI5's current director general, Sir Ken McCallum.A public inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people, concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The inquiry chairman only uncovered what MI5 had done through his own persistent investigations during secret evidence sessions.The government has been resisting calls by families bereaved by the Manchester Arena attack for MI5 officers to be fully included in planned new legislation - known as the Hillsborough Law - that's designed to stop cover-ups and enforce truth-telling by public officials.Getty ImagesA public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of key intelligence it heldAnother ongoing case is an example of how MI5's evidence cannot always be taken at face value: MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about having maintained its NCND secrecy policy in relation to an abusive neo-Nazi agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete. But MI5 had in fact told me the man was an agent when attempting to prevent me from investigating him. In the Stakeknife investigation, MI5 disclosed key documents years after enquiries began, aer Scappaticci had died and charging decisions had been made, and at a point when the Legacy Act banned police from investigating further. The new material revealed MI5 had greater and earlier knowledge of Stakeknife than detectives had previously been told, including that MI5 had been involved in tasking him. The lead detective said it was a \"significant failure on the part of MI5\". A review commissioned by MI5 found no deliberate wrongdoing.Cover-ups and failures to disclose information have a long history in Northern Ireland. Lord Stevens, recalling his investigations, has said: \"I was misled deliberately, I was criminally obstructed from doing my job by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and military, whilst MI5 failed to disclose information.\"Judge Pomerance, who was senior counsel on another major investigation, concluded bluntly: \"The state viewed itself as above the law\".The battle of bereaved familiesLast July, days before Eugene Thompson died, Jon Boutcher delivered a letter of apology on behalf of PSNI. He apologised for the police's failure to take action that may have prevented Paul Thompson's murder, and for failures in the investigation, including not properly pursuing suspects.Mark Thompson from Relatives for Justice (no relation of Paul and Eugene Thompson) says the apology was \"important\" but that Eugene was by this stage \"very ill\".Thompson familyJust before he died, Eugene Thompson (right) received an apology for police failings over the murder of his brother Paul (left). Their mother Margaret is also picturedMark had watched the Supreme Court hearings with Eugene on a laptop in his hospice and describes the experience as \"tough\". Eugene was \"praying and hoping that before he died the judgment could be made\", Mark says.Bereaved families caught up in these cases have had to battle for decades, trying to fill voids left by the lack of proper investigations by the state.\"You became an investigator, tracking down witnesses. You became an expert in the law in that field. And you fought your own case tooth and nail.\"Eugene Thompson became an \"accidental lawyer and expert in his own case\", he says, as he campaigned for answers about why his brother Paul was murdered.\"I think if we take anything from the legacy of him, it's the example of never giving up.\"Top image credit: PA MediaEmail: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @investigation.56Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge4 days agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"Back in Columbia University, all those years ago, the student from Pakistan had asked me a question. \"Don't you find it interesting,\" he said, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based international order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "5 hours agoMaia DaviesMetropolitan PoliceMatvei Rumiantsev, 22, was convicted on Wednesday at Snaresbrook Crown CourtA Russian man has been found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after Donald Trump's son told UK police he had seen a woman being beaten up on a video call.Barron Trump, 19, contacted officers when he was in the US to say his friend had been attacked by Matvei Rumiantsev in London in January 2025, a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.Prosecutors said Rumiantsev, 22, had been jealous of the woman's friendship with Trump. Rumiantsev, who lived in Canary Wharf, east London, was also convicted of perverting the course of justice. He was found not guilty of one count of rape and intentional strangulation, and another of rape and assault alleged to have occurred in November 2024.The trial had heard that Trump called the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on 18 January last year and contacted UK police shortly afterwards.\"I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up,\" he said, according to a transcript of the call released by the Crown Prosecution Service.Asked by the operator how he knew the woman, Trump said: \"I don't think these details matter, she's getting beat up but OK fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters.\"The operator responded: \"Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions?\"A few months later, in May 2025, Trump told police in an email that what he saw had been \"very brief indeed but indeed prevalent\".The 19-year-old said his video call to the woman had been picked up by \"a shirtless man with darkish hair\".This view lasted \"maybe one second\" before the camera flipped to \"the victim getting hit while crying\", he told police, adding: \"This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds.\"Jurors heard that Rumiantsev and the woman had been drinking together on the evening of 17 January and into the next morning.The prosecution said he assaulted the woman on 18 January 2025, including hitting her in the face. Getty ImagesBarron Trump is the US president's fifth and youngest childJudge Mr Justice Bennathan KC had cautioned the jury not to rely on Trump's account as the main basis for a conviction, noting he had not given evidence under oath or been cross-examined.Prosecutor Serena Gates said Rumiantsev had been jealous of the woman's friendship with Trump, perhaps because of his \"public profile\".Asked during cross-examination whether he was jealous of men the victim might speak to, Rumiantsev said: \"What I was really unhappy about was that she was frankly leading him [Trump] on.\"Mr Justice Bennathan KC told Rumiantsev the trial was about whether he \"attacked her or not\".Rumiantsev responded: \"I am being portrayed as a jealous person who can lose his temper due to jealousy. I want to just make clear that her actions towards him was wrong and it was not fair.\"He added: \"I was jealous to some extent.\"The conviction for perverting the court of justice relates to a letter Rumiantsev wrote to the woman from prison after the 18 January attack, asking her to withdraw her allegations.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSoroush PakzadBBC PersianBBCX-rays showed birdshot embedded in the legs of a wounded protester\"People helped us and we got into a car... I said, 'Don't take us to a hospital.'\"Tara and her friend were attending a protest in the central Iranian city of Isfahan when security forces arrived on motorcycles and began shouting at the crowd.\"My friend told an armed member of the security forces, 'Just don't shoot us,' and he immediately fired several shots at us. We fell to the ground. All our clothes were covered in blood,\" she said.They were bundled into a stranger's car, but Tara said they were too frightened to be taken to the hospital because of the risk of being arrested. \"All the alleyways were full of security forces, so I asked a couple standing at their front door to let us in.\"They stayed at the couple's home until it was almost dawn and then managed to find a doctor they knew, who cleaned the birdshot wounds on their legs, according to Tara.She said a surgeon was later able to remove some of the birdshot at home but warned them: \"They cannot all be removed and will remain in your bodies.\"All names in this article have been changed for their safety.Warning: This story contains details and images which some readers might find distressing.The full scale of the bloodshed resulting from the crackdown by security forces on the anti-government protests that swept across Iran this month is still not known because of an internet shutdown and a ban on reporting by most international news organisations.But the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, 112 children, 50 bystanders and 214 affiliated with the government. It is also investigating reports of 17,091 more deaths.At least another 11,000 protesters were seriously wounded, according to HRANA.Some of them have told the BBC that they have avoided seeking treatment for their injuries at hospitals because they fear being arrested.That has left them reliant on doctors, nurses and other volunteers willing to risk their own safety by treating them secretly at their homes.Healthcare workers have also told the BBC that security forces are present in hospitals and that they are constantly monitoring patients' medical records to identify injured protesters.Tara was able to find doctors willing to treat her wounds at their homesNima, a surgeon in Tehran, said he witnessed many young people being injured in the streets on his way to work on 8 January, when authorities responded to the escalating protests with lethal force.\"I put one of the wounded in the boot of my car to take him to hospital, as I was worried that we would get in trouble if we were stopped by the police,\" he told the BBC.Nima said armed officers stopped him but allowed him to go after seeing his hospital identification card.\"For almost 96 hours straight - without interruption, without sleep, without even closing our eyes for a moment - we were operating. We were crying and operating. Nobody complained.\"\"All our clothes and hospital gowns were covered in blood - our outer clothes, our underwear, everything was soaked in the blood of these young people.\"Nima described operating on one man who had been shot in the leg and face at a protest.\"A bullet had entered through his chin, ripped through his mouth and exited through his upper jaw,\" he recalled.Nima also said many of the young people treated at his hospital suffered gunshot wounds to their vital organs and limbs that required amputation and left them with permanent disabilities.Blood was seen on the floor of a hospital in TehranIranian authorities have said more than 3,100 people have been killed during the unrest, but that majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Health ministry spokesman Hossein Shokri was also quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency as saying that around 13,000 operations had been carried out during the unrest.\"Fortunately, people trust the ministry of health and hospitals, and confidence that all injured individuals are treated impartially in medical centres has led around 3,000 people who had been treating themselves at home over the past six days to seek care at hospitals,\" he added.The head of the Farabi Eye Hospital in Tehran, Dr Qasem Fakhrai, told Isna, another semi-official news agency, that it had treated a total of 700 patients with severe eye injuries requiring emergency surgery as of 10 January, and referred almost 200 to other hospitals. He said almost all of the patients were admitted after 8 January.Imanemunmusic/XVideo footage from a street in eastern Tehran showed wounded people fleeing the sound of gunfire at a protestSaeed told the BBC that his friend's eyes were hit by birdshot fired by security forces during a protest in the central city of Arak.Local doctors told him to go to a specialist eye hospital in Tehran, he said.Upon arrival, nurses took protesters with eye injuries to operating theatres through the back by using staff lifts.According to Saeed's friend, around 200 people with eye injuries from different cities were being treated at that hospital.\"He had two operations, but the surgeon did not charge him,\" Saeed said.A healthcare worker in Tehran also said that doctors were trying to avoid mentioning gunshot wounds in medical records because they were being constantly monitored by security forces.Vahid OnlineVideo footage from early January showed security forces storming a hospital in Ilam where activists said wounded protesters were being treatedSina took his brother to a hospital after he was shot in the legs during protests in Tehran.\"It was like a battlefield hospital - there were so many wounded that there were no blankets or medical kits,\" Sina told the BBC.\"When I asked a nurse for a blanket for my brother, she told me to bring one from home because there were too many injured and not enough supplies.\"Sina said they had no choice but to give their actual ID number in order to use their health insurance. \"At any moment, the security forces could raid our home,\" he added.In smaller cities, the situation is believed to be even more dire.Reports received by the BBC said security forces had abducted patients from hospitals and that they had not been seen again.HRANADr Alireza Golchini, a surgeon in Qazvin, has reportedly been arrested for treating injured protestersHuman rights groups have also said that medics and others who have treated injured protesters are now themselves being targeted by security forces.Iran Human Rights (IHR) said last week its sources on the ground in Iran had reported the arrest of at least five doctors and a volunteer first responder. \"Security agencies appear to be aiming to intimidate the public and obstruct treatment for injured protesters by arresting doctors and raiding makeshift medical shelters,\" the Norway-based organisation warned.And this week, sources close to Dr Alireza Golchini, a surgeon from the northern city of Qazvin, said he had been beaten up at his home by security forces when they arrested him for treating injured protesters.They added that he had been accused of \"moharebeh\" (enmity against God) - an offence that can carry the death penalty under Iranian law.Additional reporting by Faren Taghizadeh and Maryam Afshang, BBC Persian",

    "body": "12 hours agoKelly NgandHosu Lee,SeoulAFPKim Keon Hee was also ordered to return a diamond necklace and pay back 12.85 million wonThe wife of South Korea's ousted former president has been sentenced to 20 months in jail for accepting bribes from the controversial Unification Church.However, the court cleared 52-year-old Kim Keon Hee on charges of stock price manipulation and receiving free opinion polls from a political broker before the 2022 presidential election, which her husband Yoon Suk Yeol won.Yoon has already been sentenced to five years' in jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024.This marks the first time in South Korea's history that a former presidential couple are convicted at the same time.On Wednesday, Judge Woo In-sung at the Seoul Central District Court ruled that Kim had \"misused her position as a means of pursuing personal gain\".\"The higher [one's] position, the more consciously one must guard against such conduct... The defendant failed to reject solicitations and was preoccupied with self-adornment,\" the judge said.In a statement after the verdict, Kim said: \"I humbly accept the court's sterm admonition and will not take its weight lightly\". \"Once again, I sincerely apologise to everyone for the concern I have caused,\" she added. Kim had previously denied all charges.A special counsel team appointed to the case said Kim received 80m won ($56,000; £40,600) of gifts, which include a Graff diamond necklace and several Chanel handbags, from the Unification Church between April and July 2022, in exchange for business and political favours. The team had sought a 15-year jail term and a fine of 2bn won for all three charges heard on Wednesday - for which Kim was convicted of one - but the judge noted that Kim was not the one who demanded or solicited the bribes, and that she had \"no significant criminal record\". She was however ordered to pay back 12.85m won in cash and the court also ordered the confiscation of the diamond necklace.Kim has also been charged over her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit Unification Church followers to the conservative People Power Party that her husband was part of, and accepting gifts in exchange for government job appointments. The court has yet to hear those cases. The former first lady had denied all charges, saying they were \"deeply unjust\", although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she said she later returned without using.She made a public apology when she appeared for questioning last August. \"I am truly sorry that a nobody like me has caused concern to the people,\" she said.Investigations into Kim's dealings with the Unification Church had also led to the arrest of church leader Han Hak-ja. Apart from the criminal allegations, Kim has also been the subject of other controversies. Last year, Sookmyung Women's University annulled an art education degree she graduated with in 1999, after an ethics panel found she had plagiarised her master's thesis.Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi in Seoul",

    "body": "2 days agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerifying Iran footage as internet blackout continuesVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

    "body": "5 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterReutersSir Keir is greeted by Chinese government officials as he lands in BeijingPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in China for a three-day visit - the first by a British prime minister in eight years.Sir Keir is seeking to strengthen trading and cultural ties between the two nations after years of acrimony.But he has faced criticism from opponents at home over the risk posed by China to the UK's national security and Xi Jinping's human rights record.The PM - who will meet President Xi on Thursday - said the trip will bring benefits to the UK and it was important to maintain a \"strategic and consistent relationship\" with the world's second largest economy.As he arrived at the airport in Beijing, Sir Keir was greeted by a delegation of Chinese government officials and presented with a bouquet of flowers. Union flags were seen flying in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.Addressing the 60 British business leaders accompanying him on the trip, the PM said: \"On this delegation, you're making history. You're part of the change that we're bringing about.\"We are resolute about being outward-looking, about taking opportunities, about building relationships...and always being absolutely focused on our national interest.\"For a UK prime minister, the politics of engaging with China is tricky.In addition to China's human rights record, there are concerns about the scale of its espionage activities in the UK, with the head of MI5 recently warning that Chinese state operatives presented a daily national security threat.Sir Keir declined to be drawn on what he would seek to raise with Chinese leaders.\"In the past, on all the trips I've done, I've always raised issues that need to be raised, but I don't want to get ahead of myself on the specifics until I've had the opportunity,\" he told reporters travelling with him.He added: \"Part of the reason for engaging with China is so that issues where we disagree can be discussed, and the issues where we agree can be progressed, and so that's the approach.\"ReutersThe union flag flies alongside the national flag of China in Tiananmen SquareSir Keir will be hoping his visit - the first by a UK prime minister since Theresa May in 2018 - will mend relations with China, while keeping US President Donald Trump on side.He has insisted the UK will not be forced to \"choose between\" China and the US, amid rising trade tensions between the two superpowers in recent years.The UK would maintain \"close ties\" with the US on business, security and defence, he said, but added that \"sticking your head in the sand and ignoring China... wouldn't be sensible\".Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she would not visit China \"at this time\" if she was prime minister. \"We should be talking more to those countries who are aligned with our interests, not the country that is doing everything it can to undermine our economy,\" she told reporters.\"I think that that is what the prime minister should be talking about and he needs to show strength, not approving a super-embassy which many people think is going to become a spy hub.\"She had earlier said she was \"worried about what he's [Starmer] going to be doing when he gets to China\".\"He's probably going to give away the Isle of Wight before he comes back. Let's have an actual foreign policy, one that is rooted in realism and focusing on Britain's national interest,\" she added.Sir Keir also faced criticism from the Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons, where deputy prime minister David Lammy stood in for him at his weekly question time session.Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Whilst the Chinese regime still holds British citizen Jimmy Lai captive in prison, and whilst the Chinese regime continues to hunt down pro-democracy protesters on the streets of Britain with bounties on their heads, the British prime minister has gone cap in hand to China to ask for a trade deal on the promise of a super-embassy from which the Chinese regime will continue to spy on us.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoAbdujalil Abdurasulov,KyivandLaura GozziSoldier describes rescue effort after train drone attackA Ukrainian soldier has described the moment a passenger train was targeted by Russian drones, killing five people.When a carriage on the train was hit in northeastern Ukraine, passengers threw themselves on the floor in panic and the military officer told them to get out immediately. Without his instruction, issued moments before the carriage burst into flames, many more passengers could have died.The officer, whose army call-sign is Omar, is part of Ukraine's 93rd brigade. He was among the passengers travelling on a route from Chop, on the border with Slovakia, to Barvinkove, the last stop before the front line in eastern Ukraine.The first of three Russian drones landed near the train, forcing it to come to a halt. \"Then we heard the rumble of another drone, and then an explosion,\" Omar tells the BBC. \"The blast was so strong that parts of the carriage shattered into splinters.\"As the commander of a drone unit, he quickly realised he and the other passengers had to get out as the train could get hit again. In all, 291 people were on the train at the time, officials say.Omar/93rd brigadeFive people were killed in the attack, which President Zelensky said was \"terrorism\"\"After the second hit, I understood that the drone operator was observing what kind of target it was hitting,\" Omar says, and a stationary train was an easy target.The carriage that suffered a direct hit quickly became engulfed in flames. \"I am in the military and I am prepared for such attacks,\" says Omar. \"But for others it was a shock to be so close to death.\"Many passengers evacuated the train in a state of deep distress, and videos from the scene show people screaming and crying as they move away from the smouldering wreck. It was too dangerous for such a large number of people to stay near the burning carriages, so he urged them to start moving towards a nearby motorway.Omar/93rd brigadeOmar said he realised that the drone operator was keeping an eye on the kind of target he had hitHe then went back to the train with some of the other passengers to check if anyone had been left behind. Inspecting the carriages, he saw a body and continued to look for survivors. Five people lost their lives in the attack.In the final carriage, Omar found a young woman with a baby.\"She was very scared and had no idea what to do but thank God she was alive,\" he says. She barely had time to put on warm clothes, and screamed she needed to go back to the carriage to retrieve her suitcase and documents, the officer says.\"I came here to bring my son,\" she told Omar as she was getting off the train. Later, Omar understood she had been travelling to the front line so that her soldier husband could see their child.The attack on the passenger train in Kharkiv region was condemned by President Volodymyr Zelensky as terrorism.It hit the heart of the railway system - a symbol of resilience in a country where the airspace has been closed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Millions of Ukrainians rely on the 21,000km-long (13,000-mile) railway network to travel around the country and to cross the border into neighbouring countries, from which they can then catch flights.Although the railways have been targeted in the past, by and large Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia rail company has been able to keep people moving on its vast network - although escalating attacks on infrastructure and severe weather have led to increasingly long delays. Trains to the frontline city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region were eventually suspended last autumn, once the area became too dangerous due to sustained aerial Russian attacks. On Wednesday, flags flew at half-mast in railway stations across Ukraine. The daily minute of silence observed across the country was dedicated to the victims of the drone strike on the train.Hours after the attack had taken place, services were running again on the Barvinkove-Chop line.",

    "body": "The politician whose death leaves a vacuum in India's richest state7 hours agoZoya MateenMumbaiGetty ImagesAjit Pawar died in a plane crash on WednesdayThe sudden death of an influential leader has left a political vacuum in India's richest state.Ajit Pawar, the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, died on Wednesday in a plane crash along with four others.Maharashtra's political landscape is notoriously complex - a web of shifting alliances, regional loyalties and rivalries. And for decades, Ajit Pawar navigated it with a mixture of pragmatism and shrewdness, swiftly rising through the ranks. Yet, beneath the public triumphs, his journey was also deeply personal: a struggle to emerge out of the formidable shadow of his uncle Sharad Pawar - the founder of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and a dominant figure in Indian politics. Born in 1959, Ajit Pawar entered politics in the 1980s under his uncle's mentorship, particularly focusing on the Pawar family stronghold of Baramati, a rural area in western Maharashtra where sugar cooperatives, banks and local institutions helped secure both economic influence and political loyalty. From an early age, Ajit Pawar was seen as the uncle's visible heir. But he was determined to forge his own path. To many, Sharad Pawar represented old-school authority: patient and strategic, he was known for his coalition-building skills and political instincts. Ajit Pawar, on the other hand, focused on regional power, governance and control over local political networks.Getty ImagesAjit Pawar (left) with his uncle Sharad Pawar, founder of NCPHis style was also markedly different. Where Sharad Pawar spoke in measured tones, Ajit Pawar was blunt and practical, his mercurial personality earning him both loyal supporters and vocal critics.But as his authority grew, so did his frustration. Ajit Pawar had risen quickly through the ranks of NCP, yet he was often seen as a lieutenant rather than a leader. Decisions were still made by the elder Pawar.The tensions simmered for years before erupting in public. In 2019, Ajit Pawar shocked Maharashtra by briefly breaking ranks with his uncle and aligning with the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form the government and claim the deputy chief minister's post.His effort to strike out by himself collapsed within days, undone by Sharad Pawar who intervened to reclaim control of the party and help his allies form the governmentBut for the first time, the family rift was out in the open. Ajit Pawar returned to the party, but the breach never fully healed.Things finally came to head four years later in 2023, when Ajit Pawar broke away from his uncle's NCP party, joined a new governing coalition led by the BJP and claimed the post of the deputy chief minister once again. This time, he also managed to split his uncle's party and claim the name and electoral symbol of NCP as his own.Getty ImagesAjit Pawar (right) with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis (left) and Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde (centre) at a joint press conference after their victory in the 2024 Maharashtra state assembly electionsFrom then, family gatherings dwindled, public appearances were mostly separate, and the Pawar name, once seen as a single axis of power, fractured into two rival camps.For Ajit Pawar's supporters, the defection was long overdue and a courageous step, reflecting his ability to adapt in India's political system, where even bitter ideological opponents might join hands to come to power. To critics, he symbolised opportunistic politics.The rupture has since become one of the most remarked-upon political dramas in Maharashtra, one that transformed its fault lines.In recent days, after civic elections in Pune and Mumbai, conversations had begun about the possibility of a reconciliation between the two factions of the NCP, led by uncle and nephew. Some speculated that Ajit Pawar might even emerge as the leader of a united party.His sudden death has brought those possibilities to an abrupt halt. Questions now swirl about whether the lawmakers who had left with him will accept the authority of his cousin, Supriya Sule - Sharad Pawar's daughter - or his wife or son, and whether the fragile alliances he nurtured can endure.Ajit Pawar leaves behind him a divided political legacy - and a reminder of how personal ambitions and familial ties can shape politics in the most surprising ways.Additional reporting by Nilesh Dhotre from BBC Marathi",

    "body": "'I couldn't save them' - US mum's horror as three sons die falling through pond ice8 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosCheyenne Hangaman says she tried to save her three children by lifting them out of the waterThree young brothers have died in Bonham, north Texas, after falling through ice on a private pond on Monday.Cheyenne Hangaman, the boys' mother, said she tried to rescue them by lifting them out of the water and placing them on the ice, but it kept breaking.\"There was three of them and only one of me... that's why I couldn't save them,\" she told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.She described her sons, aged six, eight and nine, as full of personality and urged families to \"make sure that you hold your kids tight, always tell them that you love them\".This story contains graphic content that some readers may find distressing.Hangaman, a mother of six, first learned of the accident when her daughter ran over to her, shouting that the boys had fallen in.The children had been out playing near the pond, about 100ft (30m) away from the house where the family had been staying. The youngest fell through first after trying to \"ice skate\" on the layer of ice on the water, Hangaman said, adding that the two older boys then jumped in after him.\"When I seen them, they were struggling, and I know their bodies were already in shock,\" she said. \"The water was freezing cold.\"AFPHangaman said she had warned the boys to stay away from the waterWhile trying to save them, she began to struggle and was rescued by a neighbour.\"I tried to fight for my kids' life, where I had to watch them struggle and drown and I couldn't help them,\" she said.The neighbour, a football coach at the school the boys attended, heard her screams and was able to pull her out of the water.\"He said he heard the screaming or the call for help and came running. My friend had a horse rope, and he pulled me out with it,\" Hangaman said.In a statement, the local sheriff's office said the two older boys were pulled out of the water first by emergency workers and a neighbour, and taken to a local hospital.The six-year-old was later recovered after \"an extensive search of the pond\", the office added.Handout/AFP(From left to right) Kaleb, Howard and EJ were full of personality, their mother saidAuthorities did not release the children's names, but family members identified them as Howard Doss, six, Kaleb Doss, eight, and EJ Doss, nine.Describing her sons, Hangaman said EJ dreamed of becoming a football star, Kaleb loved to dance and sing, and the youngest, Howard, \"liked making people laugh\".The boys' school said they were \"devastated by this unimaginable loss\" in a letter to families seen by CBS News and that counsellors would be available to meet students and staff.",

    "body": "Ecuador says ICE agent attempted to enter its Minneapolis consulate9 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlineWatch: ICE agent attempts to enter Ecuador's Minneapolis consulateThe government of Ecuador has condemned what it described as an attempt by a US federal immigration agent to enter the Ecuadorean consulate in Minneapolis.The agent was prevented from gaining access by consular officials, who acted \"to guarantee the protection of the Ecuadoreans who were inside the consulate at the time\", a statement by Ecuador's foreign ministry said. Ecuador, whose president is an ally of Trump, has filed an official complaint.The incident comes at a time of high tension in the US city, just days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot dead by border agents during protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.Ecuador's foreign ministry said in a statement that an agent of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) had \"tried to enter the premises of the consulate\" at 11:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday.According to the Convention, the authorities of the country where the consulate is located \"shall not enter\" the parts of the consulate used for work \"except with the consent of the head of the consular post\".Ecuador said that its officials had not consented to ICE entering the consulate. While the Vienna Convention goes on to say that consent may be assumed in certain cases, they are limited to incidents where \"prompt protective action\" is required, such as in the case of a fire or some other disaster.In a video shared by Ecuadorean media, which has not been independently verified by the BBC, a consular official can be seen rushing to the entrance door and telling an ICE agent \"this is the consulate, you're not allowed in here\".The agent tells the official that \"if you touch me, I will grab you\". The consular official then states again that \"you can not enter here, this is a consulate, this is a foreign government's office\", before closing the door. In its statement, Ecuador's foreign ministry said that it had \"immediately\" handed an official letter of protest to the US embassy in Quito.The protest letter constitutes a rare note of discord between Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and the Trump administration. Just over two months ago, the presidents agreed to strengthen their countries' commercial and economic relationship and Noboa has in the past thanked Trump for designating two Ecuadorean criminal gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organisations.Photo by Jim Watson - Pool/Getty ImagesICE agents are among the 3,000 officers deployed to the region as part of a crackdown on immigrantsThe actions of immigration and border agents in Minneapolis - in particular the fatal shooting of Pretti on 24 January and that of Renee Good a few weeks earlier - have triggered protests in the city and beyond. There are currently 3,000 immigration agents and officers in the region. Securing the US's borders and implementing tougher enforcement of immigration rules has been one of Trump's top priorities. According to a 20 January statement by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, her department removed \"more than 675,000 illegal aliens\" from the US since Trump was sworn in to a second term a year ago.

The aviation regulator has launched an investigation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Pawar's death \"shocking and saddening\" and praised his service to the people of Maharashtra. His funeral will be held on Thursday morning.Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis described his death as \"an immeasurable loss\" and announced three days of mourning in the state. Pawar was one of Maharashtra's most influential leaders, governing in coalition with India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The 66-year-old was affectionately called 'dada', a term for elder brother in the Marathi language, by party workers and the public.Sanjay Raut, from the state's opposition Shiv Sena (UBT) party, said Pawar's death was a \"dark day\".\"Without Dada, the political landscape of Maharashtra is incomplete. He had an open-hearted personality and every party worker admired him,\" he said.Federal Home Minister Amit Shah, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and others have also paid tribute.Getty ImagesSharad Pawar (left) and his daughter, Supriya SuleWho was Ajit Pawar?Ajit Pawar was a towering figure in Maharashtra's politics.For decades, he was a key member of the Nationalist Congress Party founded by his uncle, veteran politician Sharad Pawar.In his early years in politics, he focused on the grassroots and built networks with workers' unions and local co-operative banks.He was elected to the Maharashtra legislative assembly from Baramati for the first time in 1991 and would be re-elected from the same constituency several times, reflecting his strong connection with voters.Pawar also served as the state's deputy chief minister many times and headed key ministries within different governments, including agriculture and finance.But his last couple of years in politics were marked by turbulence and rebellion as he sought to move away from the shadow of his uncle and pursue his own political ambitions.Obituary: The politician whose death leaves a vacuum in India's richest stateIn 2019, he made a dramatic move by breaking away from the NCP to join the state's ruling BJP government as the deputy chief minister. But lacking  support from the NCP's cadre, the alliance collapsed and Pawar returned to his party within days.He was made deputy chief minister again when the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena joined hands to form the government and played a key role in the coalition for the next three years.But tensions within the NCP continued to rise and in 2023, Pawar once again split from the party, this time with a large group of legislators, causing the NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena alliance to collapse. India's Election Commission would later recognise his faction as the official NCP.Pawar then helped form the state's new tri-party coalition government led by the BJP.He continued to serve as deputy chief minister but shared the post with another politician.In recent months, there were reports about a possible reconciliation between uncle and nephew, but neither of them officially confirmed this.Getty ImagesPawar (right) with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis (centre) and the other Deputy Chief Minister Eknath ShindeHow did his plane crash?Pawar was reportedly travelling to Baramati to address public meetings related to upcoming local elections when his plane crashed. India's aviation regulator has said that the aircraft he was travelling on was a  Bombardier Learjet 45, which is a small business jet commonly used for charter flights and VIP travel in India.Pawar was accompanied by two staff members and two crew members who also died in the crash.\"The aircraft was cleared for landing in Baramati on Wednesday morning after multiple attempts but, having finally received landing clearance, it did not give any \"read-back\" or response to the Air Traffic Control and moments later burst into flames on the edge of the runway\", the federal aviation ministry said in a statement.How will Pawar's death affect Maharashtra's politics?Pawar's death will leave a vacuum in his party and also in Maharashtra's political landscape.He enjoyed huge support from his party members and was also loved by the public.Pawar was regarded as a shrewd administrator and skilled orator, and his witty remarks and fiery speeches made headlines and landed him in controversies many times. Over his decades-long career, he was accused of corruption, but he always denied the allegations against him.In the past decade or so, he had chartered a new trajectory for the NCP by embarking on surprising political alliances and managing to stay in power despite it taking a toll on his family.It's unclear who, or if anyone at all, will be able to fill Pawar's shoes in the NCP.Pawar's death will also have ramifications for the ruling alliance in Maharashtra as his party is left without its strongest leader.While the BJP-led ruling coalition has the numbers to run the government even without all of Ajit Pawar's lawmakers, any defection could lead to even more turbulence in Maharashtra's political landscape.",

    "body": "A string of scandals and luxury handbags: Who is South Korea's former first lady?14 hours agoGavin ButlerandHyojung Kim,BBC World ServiceGetty ImagesThe scandals Kim Keon Hee faces predate her husband Yoon's ill-fated political careerTwo Chanel handbags, a BMW dealership and a controversial church were at the centre of a trial faced by South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee.The wife of disgraced former president Yoon Suk Yeol, she was arrested in August over a raft of charges including bribery, stock manipulation, and political interference - all of which she denies.Prosecutors had accused Kim, 52, of making more than 800 million won ($552,570; £404,050) by participating in a price-rigging scheme involving the stocks of Deutsch Motors, a BMW dealer in South Korea, between October 2010 and December 2012.She was also accused of accepting luxury bags, a diamond necklace and other gifts worth up to 80m won as bribes from the controversial Unification Church in exchange for business favours, and receiving 58 free opinion polls, worth 270 million Korean won, from political broker Myung Tae-kyun before the 2022 presidential election.On Wednesday, a court found her guilty of accepting bribes from Unification Church officials, sentencing her to 20 months in jail. However, she was cleared on charges of stock price manipulation and violating South Korea's campaign financing laws. There are still two cases against her that the court is yet to hear. The verdict comes less than a fortnight after her husband was sentenced to jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid.It also marks the first time in history that a presidential spouse has been indicted while detained.But it is far from the first time Kim herself has been embroiled in controversy.Questionable credentialsBefore she was South Korea's first lady, Kim Keon Hee – born Kim Myeong-sin – was a businesswoman and art lover.She graduated with an art education degree from Sookmyung Women's University in 1999, but would later face repeated allegations of plagiarism over her time as a student there – leading the university to annul her degree in 2025 after its research ethics panel found her thesis was compromised.She has never commented on these allegations publicly. In 2009, she founded art exhibition company Covana Contents, for which she is still CEO and president – but in 2019 South Korean media reported that she had allegedly evaded paying taxes and received kickbacks for hosting art exhibitions. Kim, who has stood down from her role, was cleared of these charges in 2023, but the special counsel is currently re-examining the case.Then, ahead of the 2022 presidential election which her husband ultimately won, allegations emerged that Kim had submitted applications to universities and companies containing false qualifications and awards, sparking a scandal over potentially fabricated credentials.In response to these allegations, which some opposition members had sought to use as a political cudgel against Yoon, Kim issued a public apology for what she described as \"exaggerations\" on her resume.She further pledged that if her husband became president she would \"focus solely on my role as his wife\".It is her conduct while in that role, however, that has drawn some of the fiercest backlash.The handbag scandalIn late-2023, spy camera footage surfaced showing Kim receiving a luxury handbag from an individual in a Seoul office in September 2022.The footage was reported to have been secretly filmed by the pastor Choi Jae-young using a camera embedded in his watch – and its publication intensified public scrutiny on both Kim and Yoon.It appeared to show Mr Choi walking to a store to purchase the greyish-blue calfskin bag, with a receipt putting its cost at 3 million won ($2,200; £1,800). Mr Choi then visits Covana Contents, a company in Seoul owned by the first lady, where Ms Kim then asks the pastor: \"Why do you keep bringing me these things?\"South Korean law makes it illegal for public officials and their spouses to receive gifts worth more than 1 million won in one go, or a total of 3 million won within a fiscal year.And while the video did not explicitly show Ms Kim accepting the gift, the Korea Herald reported at the time that the presidential office confirmed receipt of the bag and said that it was \"being managed and stored as a property of the government\".Getty ImagesYoon Suk Yeol and Kim Keon Hee mark the first time both a former president and former first lady have been jailedThe presidential office did not immediately respond to the coverage, further fuelling the controversy, as civic groups filed complaints with the prosecution citing potential violations of the Anti-Graft Act.This incident was one of 16 allegations looked into by the special counsel team, 12 of which were passed to police for further investigation.Wednesday's verdict, however, focused on Kim allegedly accepting other bribes from the Unification Church, as well as her alleged involvement in Deutsch Motors stock manipulation and alleged election meddling.Kim denied the charges - although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she says she later returned without using.Prosecutors had last month called for a 15-year prison term and a fine of 2 billion won, saying she had \"stood above the law\" and colluded with the Unification Church to undermine the \"constitutionally mandated separation of religion and state\".DisgraceWhile Kim's string of scandals cast a shadow over her husband's presidential career, it was Yoon himself who ultimately sealed his own fate as one of South Korea's most disgraced former leaders.On 16 January, Yoon was found guilty of abuse of power, falsifying documents and obstructing justice when he tried and failed to impose martial law in the country in 2024. He has also been sentenced to five years in jail.It was the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to Yoon's shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said while delivering the verdict, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".It was during a year-long probe into Yoon's failed martial law attempt that special prosecutors started investigating many of the allegations against Kim.Together, the once-powerful-couple make a historic pair: while South Korea has a history of former presidents being indicted and imprisoned, Yoon and Kim mark the first time both a former president and former first lady have been jailed.",

    "body": "1 day agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoGetty ImagesTikTok has reached a settlement to avoid it being involved in a landmark social media addiction trial - a matter of hours before jury selection was due to begin in California.The plaintiff, a 20-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health.\"The parties are pleased to have reached an amicable resolution of this dispute,\" the Social Media Victims Law Center said of the TikTok settlement, adding the terms were confidential.'Dangerous and addictive algorithms'The named social media companies have said the plaintiff's evidence falls short of proving they are responsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders.The case going to trial marks a distinct shift in how the US legal system treats tech firms, which face mounting claims that their products lead to addictive behaviours.The companies have long argued that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress in 1996, exempts platforms from liability for what third parties post.But at issue in this case are design choices about algorithms, notifications and other features that affect how people use their apps.KGM's attorney, Matthew Bergman, told the BBC the case will be the first time a social media company has been held to account by a jury at trial.\"Unfortunately, there are all too many kids in the United States, the UK, and around the world who are suffering as KGM does because of the dangerous and addictive algorithms that the social media platforms foist on unsuspecting kids,\" he said.\"These companies are going to have to explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the lives of our young people.\"Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, told the BBC that losing these cases in court could pose an existential threat to the social media companies.But he said it may be difficult for plaintiffs to prove physical harms can be blamed on content publishers.\"The fact that the plaintiffs have been able to sell that idea has opened the door to a whole bunch of new legal questions that the law wasn't really designed to answer,\" he said.'The tech industry has been given deferential treatment'At trial, jurors are expected to see an array of evidence, including excerpts from internal company documents.\"A lot of what these companies have been trying to shield from the public is likely going to be aired in court,\" said Mary Graw Leary, a law professor at Catholic University of America.Meta says it has introduced dozens of tools to support a safer environment for teens online.\"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,\" it said in a statement.The companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users.One highly-anticipated witness the jury will hear from is Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who is due to testify early in the trial.In 2024, he told US senators \"the existing body of scientific work has not shown any causal link between social media and young people having worse mental health outcomes\".During that same hearing, at the prodding of one senator, Zuckerberg apologised to victims and their loved ones who had crowded into the chamber.Tech executives \"are often not good under pressure\" said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at George Washington University. She said the firms were \"very much much hoping\" they could avoid having top bosses testify.The trial comes as the companies face growing scrutiny from families, school districts, and prosecutors worldwide.Last year, dozens of US states sued Meta, alleging the company misled the public over risks of social media use and had contributed to a youth mental health crisis.Australia has enacted a social media ban on under-16s, and the UK signalled in January it may follow.\"There is a tipping point when it comes to the harms of social media,\" Franks said. \"The tech industry has been given deferential treatment - I think we're seeing that start to change.\"",

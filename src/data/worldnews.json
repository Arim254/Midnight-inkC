The banking secrecy laws, now much diluted, were designed to shield an individual's personal finances from the prying eyes of the state.</p><p>For years, Google Street View was controversial in Switzerland - and even today, following a ruling by the Swiss Federal Court, images taken close to schools, women's refuges, hospitals or prisons must be automatically blurred before going online. </p><p>There are also far fewer CCTV cameras in Switzerland than in many of its European neighbours.</p><p>Opponents of digital ID cards, who gathered enough signatures to force another referendum on the issue, argue that this measure could still undermine individual privacy.</p><p>They also fear that, despite the new restrictions on how data is collected and stored, it could still be used to track people and for marketing purposes.</p><p>The latest opinion polls, however, show that this time, voters may be ready to give electronic IDs a chance. </p><p>They have already had experience of the government's Covid ID, which was used during the pandemic to show vaccination status and was mandatory to enter restaurants and bars. </p><p>Initial scepticism turned to satisfaction when people realised it allowed them, finally, to get out and about again.</p><p>As for the concerns about marketing of personal data, most Swiss have smartphones and are keen users of social media. </p><p>Tech giants are already harvesting their likes and dislikes, many voters realise, so believe that allowing the Swiss authorities to check on a few details from time to time will not make a big difference.</p></div>"

Officers later found his abandoned vehicle and located him with the help of Iowa State Patrol. </p><p>Mr Roberts has an existing weapons charge from February 2020 and had originally entered the US on a student visa in 1999, according to ICE.

It empowered a high commissioner to behave like a dictator [and] Palestinian people bore the brunt,\" he said.</p><p>\"Recognition alone does not deal with all these historic problems which for Palestinians are not history but the living reality to this day,\" said Prof Kattan, an expert in public international law at the University of Nottingham.</p><p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) would not confirm whether ministers had been made aware of the legal petition saying it did not \"routinely comment on\" them, although the BBC understands that Deputy Prime Minister and former Foreign Secretary David Lammy is to ask officials to look into the submission.</p><p>It documents three decades of alleged abuses by UK forces during mounting violence until 1948, after which the UK rapidly withdrew and the State of Israel was declared.</p><p>The alleged abuses by British forces range from murder, torture, expulsion and collective punishment which the submission says repressed the Arab Palestinian population amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-63145992\">In 2022, a BBC review of some of the historical evidence involved found details of arbitrary killings,</a> arson of entire villages, \"caging\" of civilians in the open air, the use of human shields by strapping them to the front of military vehicles and the introduction of home demolitions as collective punishment. </p><p>The evidence included audio recordings made decades later in which British soldiers and police officers described abuses. Some were conducted within formal policy guidelines for UK forces at the time or with the consent of senior officers.</p><p>The UK Ministry of Defence said in 2022 it was aware of historical allegations against armed forces personnel during the period, and any evidence provided would be \"reviewed thoroughly\".</p><p>During World War One, Britain invaded Palestine, driving out the Ottoman Turks, and it facilitated its promise for a Jewish homeland made in the 1917 Balfour Declaration. </p><p>In the decades that followed, violence mounted between Arabs and Jews. </p><p>An insurgency known as the Arab Revolt broke out against British rule from 1936 until 1939. It was brutally suppressed by the British leaving about 10% of the adult male Arab Palestinian population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled, according to one estimate.</p><p>The Palestinian petitioners seek to build on previous concessions made by the UK over colonial-era war crimes, including this year's apology for the 1948 Batang Kali massacre in Malaya and the settlement over abuses of Kenyans during the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s.</p><p>The decision by the UK, France and several other countries to recognise a Palestinian state saw them join more than 150 nations that already do so. </p><p>The move was welcomed by Palestinians - but rejected by Israel and the US, which argued it damaged efforts to mediate a ceasefire in the war in the Gaza Strip.</p></div>"

Obey the order of humanity!\"</p><p>Petro added: \"As happened in the First World War, I want the young people, sons and daughters of workers and farmers, of both Israel and the United States, to point their rifles not toward humanity, but toward the tyrants and toward the fascists.\"</p><p>The US State Department strongly criticised the remarks, saying he had \"urged US soldiers to disobey orders and incite violence\".</p><p>It wrote on social media that the revocation of his visa was \"due to his reckless and incendiary actions\".</p><p>Colombia's Interior Minister Armando Benedetti wrote on X on Friday night that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visa should have been annulled rather than Petro's.</p><p>\"But since the empire protects him, it's taking it out on the only president who was capable enough to tell him the truth to his face,\" he said.</p><p>Relations between Petro - who leads Colombia's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-61860887\">first ever left-wing government</a> - and the Trump administration have worsened in recent months.</p><p>The Colombian leader used his speech at the UN to launch an excoriating rebuke of US strikes on boats suspected of being used to transport drugs, arguing they were not about controlling the drug trade but serving a need to use \"violence to dominate Colombia and Latin America\".</p><p>He said some of those killed by the strikes may have been from Colombia, which is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-66784678\">the world's biggest cocaine producer</a>, and claimed US officials were allied to drug gangs while his government was persuading farmers to not grow coca.</p><p>Petro likened the air strikes to an \"act of tyranny\" in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8rjp178mno\">interview with the BBC</a>.</p><p>Washington contends the actions are part of a US anti-drug operation off the coast of Venezuela, whose president it accuses of running a cartel.</p><p>The US also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdym32z9v7o\">denied visas for Mahmoud Abbas</a>, the Palestinian president, and 80 Palestinian officials, blocking them from attending the UN General Assembly, despite world leaders conventionally being permitted to attend the body's headquarters regardless of their relations with the US.</p></div>"

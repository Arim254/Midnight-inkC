    "body": "Dutch volleyball player and convicted child rapist denied visa to compete in Australia14 hours agoLana LamSydneyReutersSteven van de Velde was due to compete in Adelaide next monthA Dutch Olympic volleyball player convicted of raping a British girl a decade ago has been denied a visa to compete in Australia.Steven van de Velde, 31, was due to play at the Beach Volleyball World Championships in Adelaide, South Australia, next month.In 2016, the then 21-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of raping a 12-year-old girl in Milton Keynes and was sentenced to four years in jail. He had met the girl on Facebook and travelled to England from Amsterdam before raping her in her home in 2014.Two weeks ago, South Australia's Attorney-General Kyam Maher wrote to the federal government, calling on authorities to reject his visa as his crimes were \"utterly abhorrent\".The letter also said \"we do not believe that foreign child sex offenders should be granted entry to this country\".Australia's Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government will \"continue to use every tool we have available to ensure that Australians can be safe and feel safe in their communities\".After the rape in 2014, Van de Velde returned to the Netherlands but in 2016, he was extradited to the UK and arrested. Ahead of his sentencing, the court heard he was aware of the girl's age.He served 12 months of his four-year sentence and restarted his professional sporting career in 2018, playing for his national team in several global tournaments.Last year, he represented the Netherlands at the Paris Olympics and was booed by some people in the crowd. Earlier, an online petition calling for him to be banned from the Olympics had attracted 90,000 signatures.The BBC has contacted the organisers of the world championship event in South Australia and the Dutch national volleyball association for comment.

    "body": "16 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoOpenAI has released new estimates of the number of ChatGPT users who exhibit possible signs of mental health emergencies, including mania, psychosis or suicidal thoughts.The company said that around 0.07% of ChatGPT users active in a given week exhibited such signs, adding that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognizes and responds to these sensitive conversations.While OpenAI maintains these cases are \"extremely rare,\" critics said even a small percentage may amount to hundreds of thousands of people, as ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users, per boss Sam Altman.As scrutiny mounts, the company said it built a network of experts around the world to advise it.Those experts include more than 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in 60 countries, the company said.They have devised a series of responses in ChatGPT to encourage users to seek help in the real world, according to OpenAI.But the glimpse at the company's data raised eyebrows among some mental health professionals.\"Even though 0.07% sounds like a small percentage, at a population level with hundreds of millions of users, that actually can be quite a few people,\" said Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor who studies technology use among young adults at the University of California, San Francisco.\"AI can broaden access to mental health support, and in some ways support mental health, but we have to be aware of the limitations,\" Dr. Nagata added.The company also estimates 0.15% of ChatGPT users have conversations that include \"explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\"OpenAI said recent updates to its chatbot are designed to \"respond safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\" and note \"indirect signals of potential self-harm or suicide risk.\"ChatGPT has also been trained to reroute sensitive conversations \"originating from other models to safer models\" by opening in a new window.In response to questions by the BBC on criticism about the numbers of people potentially affected, OpenAI said that this small percentage of users amounts to a meaningful amount of people and noted they are taking changes seriously. The changes come as OpenAI faces mounting legal scrutiny over the way ChatGPT interacts with users.In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple sued the company over the death of their teenage son alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life in April.The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.In a separate case, the suspect in a murder-suicide that took place in August in Greenwich, Connecticut posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fuelled the alleged perpetrator's delusions.More users struggle with AI psychosis as \"chatbots create the illusion of reality,\" said Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law. \"It is a powerful illusion.\"She said OpenAI deserved credit for \"sharing statistics and for efforts to improve the problem\" but added: \"the company can put all kinds of warnings on the screen but a person who is mentally at risk may not be able to heed those warnings.\" ",

    "body": "Most countries fail to submit new climate pledges ahead of summit5 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesOnly 64 countries have submitted new plans to cut carbon, the UN says, despite all being required to do so ahead of next month's COP30 summit.Added together these national pledges would fail to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C, a key threshold to very dangerous levels of climate change.While the UN review does show progress in curbing carbon emissions over the next decade, the projected fall is not enough to stop temperatures surging past this global target.The report underlines the scale of the task facing world leaders who head to Belém in northern Brazil next week for the COP30 climate gathering.Ten years after the Paris climate pact was agreed in 2015, the efforts of countries to restrict the rise in global temperatures are under renewed scrutiny.Every signatory agreed to submit a new carbon-cutting plan every five years, which would cover the next decade.But only 64 countries managed to put a new pledge in place this year, despite many extensions of the deadline. These represent around 30% of global emissions.In addition, the UN's review includes statements from China and the EU on their future plans made at Climate Week in New York in September.Taken together, the efforts mean that global emissions of carbon dioxide should fall by around 10% by 2035.However, scientists say that such a drop is nowhere near enough to keep the rise in temperatures under 1.5C.To keep that goal alive will require steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, up to 57% by 2035, according to the UN last year.\"This report shows that we are going in the right direction but too slowly,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, often referred to as a key architect of the Paris Agreement.\"It is essential to acknowledge the missing national pledges and confront the persistent gap between ambition and actual implementation.\"The 1.5C limit, agreed at Paris, has long been seen as the threshold of very dangerous warming. In 2018, scientists outlined the massive benefits to the world of keeping the rise under 1.5C as compared to allowing them to rise to 2C. Passing 1.5C include more frequent and intense heatwaves and storms, increased damage to coral reefs and growing threats to human health and livelihoods, UN scientists have said.However, that limit was breached in 2024 for a whole year for the first time. UN leaders are increasingly accepting the fact that the threshold will be breached permanently by the early 2030s at current rates.Getty ImagesBrazil's President Lula visits Belém ahead of COP30 in November\"One thing is already clear: we will not be able to contain the global warming below 1.5C in the next few years,\" UN secretary general António Guterres told delegates at a meeting of the World Meteorological Organisation last week.\"Overshooting is now inevitable. Which means that we're going to have a period, bigger or smaller, with higher or lower intensity, above 1.5C in the years to come.\"Despite this, the UN is keen to stress that there are some significant green shoots in the new report that provide hope.Many more countries are expected to lodge plans as their leaders gather for COP30 in Belém in Brazil.Large carbon producers such as India and Indonesia haven't yet unveiled their carbon plans. They will likely do so during COP30 and these may have a significant impact on the overall projections for 2035.Some countries are also likely to cut faster and deeper than they've promised, say experts.\"It's actually completely reasonable to look at China,\" said Todd Stern, former US Special Envoy for climate change.\"They'll put down a certain number, which is not great, and then they will overachieve it, and China does that a lot.\"The UN says they are confident that emissions globally will likely peak and start to decline in the next few years, for the first time since the industrial revolution in the 19th century.They say the plans in place show clear stepping stones to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming \"greenhouse\" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere.One important factor is that the cuts assessed by the UN include the planned US pledge submitted under President Biden.While President Donald Trump has said he will pull out of the Paris agreement, that process is not completed yet, so the UN are keeping the US plans in their calculations even if these won't happen as planned.",

The aircraft was flying from the popular beach resort of Diani to an airstrip in the world-famous Maasai Mara game park when it went down at 05:30 local time (02:30 GMT), the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) said. Mombasa Air Safari said the plane was carrying eight Hungarians, two Germans and a Kenyan pilot, all of whom had been killed in the crash. \"Our primary focus right now is on providing all possible support to the families affected,\" it added in a statement.Local media have published images of the plane in flames, with debris scattered at the site of the crash.Kwale County Commissioner Stephen Orinde told the BBC that the plane crashed about 10km (six miles) from Kwale town after flying out of Diani.It was on its way to Kichwa Tembo, an airstrip in Maasai Mara, popular with holidaymakers because of its wildlife. \"The passengers were all tourists,\" Orinde said.He said that investigations into the cause of the crash were ongoing but suggested it could have been due to bad weather.\"The weather is not very good here at the moment. Since early in the morning, it is raining and it is very misty, but we cannot preempt [the findings],\" Orinde said.In August, a light aircraft belonging to the medical charity Amref crashed on the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi, killing six people and injuring two others.",

    "body": "A statue of a Confederate general that was torn down and set on fire in 2020 during social justice protests in Washington has been reinstalled under orders from President Donald Trump. General Albert Pike's statue has long been a source of controversy, as have many Confederate monuments across the US which were erected decades after the Civil War.The National Park Service announced in August its plan to return the refurbished statue, after Trump signed an executive order called \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\".Democratic Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia, called the restoration  “offensive to members of the military who serve honorably”.On Monday afternoon,  videos showed the area surrounding Pike's statue in Washington with a sign that read  \"Area close. Historic preservation work in progress\". \"The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic-preservation law and recent executive orders to beautify the nation’s capital and restore pre-existing statues,\"  the National Park Service in a statement.These confederate statues caused US protests. Knocked down, they're the centre of a new art showThe statue, which was built in 1901, has been a source of controversy for many years. Members of local government have been calling for its removal for decades. Holmes Norton, a long-time critic, has introduced legislation to remove the Pike statue permanently multiple times. \"Pike himself served dishonourably,\" she said in a statement after the statue was restored. \"He took up arms against the United States, misappropriated funds, and was ultimately captured and imprisoned by his own troops.\"\"Confederate statues should be placed in museums as historical artifacts, not remain in parks or other locations that imply honor,\" Holmes Norton added. Pike's statue was the only monument to a Confederate general in the nation's capital before it was pulled down in 2020.Pike was a longtime leader of the Freemasons, a centuries-old secretive society, who paid for the statue. His body is interred at the Washington headquarters of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which also contains a small museum in his honour.Pike's critics have accused him of being instrumental in the formation of the Ku Klux Klan. Masons insist that evidence doesn't support the allegations.The plaque that previously labelled the statue read \"author, poet, scholar, soldier, jurist, orator, philanthropist and philosopher\". Anti-racism protesters used ropes and chains to pull down the Pike statue following the murder of  George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of a police officer in 2020.Then-President Trump, in his first term, condemned the toppling on Twitter, writing: \"The DC police are not doing their job as they watched a statue be ripped down and burn. These people should be immediately arrested. A disgrace to our country.\"Floyd's death ignited a nationwide reckoning with systemic racism, prompting widespread calls to remove Confederate monuments. Ultimately, more than 300 such memorials were taken down across the country.Since returning to the White House, Trump has ordered statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled. ",

    "body": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the makers of Tylenol, claiming the companies hid alleged dangers that the drug posed to children's brain development. The lawsuit comes a month after President Donald Trump promoted an unproven link between taking Tylenol - also known as paracetamol - during pregnancy and autism in children.  Paxton is suing Johnson & Johnson, which previously sold the drug, the only pain reliever recommended for pregnant women, and Kenvue, which now manufacturers it.  In a statement, he said they \"betrayed America by profiting off of pain and pushing pills regardless of the risks.\"Kenvue says there is no credible evidence tying Tylenol to autism.\"These corporations lied for decades, knowingly endangering millions to line their pockets,\" Paxton, a Republican, said.Kenvue said in a statement that it was \"deeply concerned by the perpetuation of misinformation on the safety of acetaminophen and the potential impact that could have on the health of American women and children\".On its website, Kenvue also said it had \"continuously evaluated the relevant science and there is no credible data that shows a proven link between taking acetaminophen and autism\". Organizations representing doctors and healthcare providers agree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said acetaminophen - the main ingredient in Tylenol - is one of the few options for pregnant women to treat pain and fever, which can pose serious health risks if left untreated. \"In more than two decades of research on the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children,\" the group said. The lawsuit cites recent announcements from the Trump administration in arguing the drug is allegedly unsafe.Last month, Trump raised alarms from public health officials when he told pregnant women to \"fight like hell\" not to take Tylenol when ill. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a notice that doctors should consider limiting the use of Tylenol, while also stating that \"a causal relationship\" between the drug and autism in children has not been established. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who oversees the FDA, had pledged in April to undertake \"a massive testing and research effort\" that would determine the cause of autism in a matter of months. But experts cautioned that finding a single cause of autism - thought by researchers to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors - would not be simple. Autism is a form of lifelong neurodivergence and disability that affects how people experience and interact with the world, and is diagnosed using doctors' observations.In his court filing, Paxton - a Trump ally who is running for US Senate - alleges Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson \"willfully ignored and attempted to silence the science\" around acetaminophen and autism. The lawsuit seeks to make the companies \"destroy any marketing or advertising\" that claims Tylenol is safe for pregnant women. The Texas lawsuit echoes the complaints of a group of parents of children with autism and ADHD who sued the makers of Tylenol in 2022.  A federal judge dismissed the case, saying research from the parents' expert witnesses was not conclusive. ",

    "body": "1 hour agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS Department of DefenseOne person survived the strikes and was rescued by Mexican search-and-rescue teams. US forces have killed 14 people in strikes on four alleged drug boats in the Pacific, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth says.He said one survivor was rescued by Mexican search and rescue personnel. It is the latest in a series of attacks on boats the US says have been carrying drugs in both the Pacific and Caribbean.The latest strikes in the eastern Pacific, which Hegseth said happened on Monday at the direction of President Donald Trump, mark an escalation in what it says is a campaign to target drug traffickers. The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. Members of the US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have also raised concerns and questioned the president's authority to order them.At least 57 people have now been killed in the strikes, which has led to increasing tensions between the US and the governments of both Colombia and Venezuela. Most strikes have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but more recently it has carried out attacks in the Pacific Ocean as well.In a statement on X, Hegseth said the four vessels hit on Monday \"were known by our intelligence apparatus, transitioning along known narco-trafficking routes and carrying narcotics\".Hegseth added that eight \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the first strike. Four and three were killed in the following two strikes. ANALYSIS: What is Trump's endgame in Venezuela?One person survived the strikes. According to Hegseth, Mexican search-and-rescue authorities \"accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue.\" The condition of the survivor or his current whereabouts are unclear. Hegseth's post included videos that show several vessels catching fire after being struck by US munitions. \"The department has spent over two decades defending other homelands,\" he wrote. \"Now, we're defending our own.\" At least four of the strikes have so far taken place in the Pacific, which is a far more significant drug-trafficking corridor, with the rest taking place in the Caribbean. President Trump has said he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters, but suggested last week that he may seek approval from Congress if the campaign is expanded to include targets on land. Trump has said he is \"totally prepared\" to strike land-based targets, which would mark a significant escalation in the campaign.The strikes, however, have drawn criticism from international law experts and both the Venezuelan and Colombian governments. In an interview with the BBC's Newsday programme last week, Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Mauricio Jaramillo said the strikes were \"disproportionate and outside international law\".Jaramillo said those on the vessels had \"no possibility to defend themselves\" and were struck with \"no process\" and \"no judicial order\". The strikes also come as tensions ratchet up with both governments. The US has placed sanctions on Colombian president Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\".In the Caribbean, the US has deployed troops, aircraft and naval vessels and last week ordered the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - to the area. Trump has accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power.The country's attorney general told the BBC there is \"no doubt\" that Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government. He accused the US of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás Maduro",

She is due in court again on Monday.In May, she was stopped at Tbilisi International Airport after 12kg (26lb) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lb) of hashish were found in her luggage. Miss Culley  previously claimed she was tortured to bring the drugs.Under the plea bargain agreement, her family paid 500,000 Georgian Lari (£137,000) to reduce her sentence.More than 90% of drug-related crimes in Georgia are resolved through plea bargains.ReutersLyanne Kennedy, speaking to reporters outside court, said her 19-year-old daughter was \"looking strong\"Speaking outside court, her mother said: \"We've confirmed that the funds have been sent but they need to confirm that they have been received and that is not going to happen until tomorrow.\"She is looking big, pregnant, but she is looking strong.\"Malkhaz Salakaia, representing Miss Culley, said the negotiations \"are nearing completion\".\"Plea bargain conditions are known to the family,\" he said.\"There is a technical issue to be resolved which will take a few days.\"Mr Salakaia previously said he planned to appeal to the president of Georgia to pardon her after finalising the plea deal.Rayhan Demytrie/BBCBella Culley is being detained at prison number 5Miss Culley initially went missing in Thailand before being arrested at Tbilisi International Airport on 10 May.It is understood she arrived on a flight from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates and police seized drugs from a travel bag.At a hearing in July, she pleaded not guilty to charges of possession and trafficking illegal drugs and claimed she had been \"forced to do this through torture\".\"I just wanted to travel,\" she said. \"I am a good person. I am a student at university. I am a clean person. I don't do drugs.\"More on this story",

    "body": "4 hours agoDavid GrittenJerusalemEPAIsraeli security forces saluted as the coffin arrived at the National Institute for Forensic MedicineIsrael says a coffin handed over by Hamas on Monday did not contain the body of another deceased hostage but more of the remains of another person held captive whose body had been previously returned.Forensic tests showed the remains belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, whose body was recovered by Israeli forces in late 2023, and not to any of the 13 deceased hostages still in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.It accused Hamas of a \"clear violation\" of the two-week-old Gaza ceasefire deal and said Netanyahu would discuss \"steps in response\".Israeli media say officials are discussing punitive measures against Hamas for returning only 15 of the 28 deceased hostages.There was no immediate comment from Hamas. The group has said it is committed to the deal brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, but that it needs help to find remains buried under the rubble left by two years of war.On Monday evening, Hamas's military wing announced that it would hand over to the Red Cross the body of an Israeli hostage which had been recovered earlier in the day.A few hours later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that its troops in Gaza had received a coffin and taken it to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification procedures.On Tuesday afternoon, the Israeli prime minister's office said it was found that \"remains belonging to fallen hostage Ofir Tzarfati – of blessed memory, who was returned from the Gaza Strip in a military operation about two years ago – were returned\".\"This constitutes a clear violation of the agreement by the Hamas terrorist organisation,\" it added. \"Prime Minister Netanyahu will hold a security discussion with the heads of the security establishment to discuss Israel's steps in response to the violations.\"Tzarfati, a 27-year-old Israeli-French dual national, was shot and wounded while being abducted by Hamas gunmen at the Nova music festival during the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, which triggered the Gaza war.At the start of December 2023, the IDF announced that his body had been found by its forces in Gaza and brought back to Israel.In March 2024, additional remains belonging to him were returned for burial, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel.\"We went to sleep last night with anticipation and hope that another family would close an agonising two-year circle and bring their loved one home for burial. But once again, deception has been inflicted upon our family as we try to heal,\" Tzarfati's family said in a statement.They added: \"This morning we were shown video footage of our beloved son's remains being removed, buried, and handed over to the Red Cross - an abhorrent manipulation designed to sabotage the deal and abandon the effort to bring all the hostages home.\"Israeli authorities have not released the footage. But Israeli media reported that an IDF drone had filmed Hamas members removing the remains from a building in Gaza City, burying them in the ground in a different location, and then calling in a Red Cross team to help dig them up.ReutersExcavators were filmed digging in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza on MondayThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum demanded an urgent meeting with the prime minister to discuss responses to what it called Hamas's \"despicable actions\".\"Hamas's repeated violations and the IDF's documentation prove what we have known and stated clearly and unequivocally: Hamas knows the location of the hostages and continues to act with contempt, deceiving the United States and mediators while dishonouring our loved ones,\" it said.\"The Israeli government cannot and must not ignore this, and must act decisively against these violations.\"It is understood that Israeli officials are discussing with US mediators various possible responses to Hamas's failure to return all the deceased hostages' bodies within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect on 10 October.One being considered is said to be expanding the area of Gaza under IDF control, which is demarcated by the so-called \"Yellow Line\".Public broadcaster Kan News said the first step taken by Israel would be to stop allowing Hamas members and Red Cross representatives to visit IDF-controlled territory to help an Egyptian team with earth-moving equipment search for the remaining dead hostages.Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian had confirmed on Monday that such visits had been permitted \"under close IDF supervision\".\"Hamas knows where they are located and there is no other option but for them to be released back home,\" she told a briefing.But Qatar-based Al Jazeera quoted Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem as saying the claim that it knew all the locations were \"false\".All 20 living Israeli hostages were released soon after the ceasefire took effect on 10 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages previously returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Eleven of the dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai. On Saturday, Hamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said the group was facing \"challenges\" because Israeli forces had \"altered the terrain of Gaza\".\"Moreover, some of those who buried the bodies have been martyred or no longer remember where they buried them,\" he added.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,500 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLiv McMahon,Technology reporter and Osmond Chia,Business reporterAmazon has confirmed it plans to cut thousands of jobs, saying it needs to be \"organised more leanly\" to seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI).The tech giant said on Tuesday it would reduce its global corporate workforce by \"approximately 14,000 roles\".Earlier reporting had suggested it was planning to lay off as many as 30,000 workers.Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon, wrote in a note to staff that the move would make the company \"even stronger\" by shifting resources \"to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs\".She acknowledged that some would question the move given the company was performing well.At the end of July, Amazon reported second quarter results which beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn).But Ms Galetti said the cuts were needed because AI was \"the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet\" and was \"enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.\"\"We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\" she added.The note, shared with Amazon employees earlier on Tuesday, said the company was \"working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted\" - including by helping those affected find new roles within Amazon.Those who cannot will receive \"transition support\" including severance pay, it said.The BBC has asked if it will affect employees in the UK.The company has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide.This includes around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, according to figures that Amazon submitted to the US government last year.Like many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services.Amazon boss Andy Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in AI tools to boost efficiency.Mr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools will likely lead to job cuts as machines take over routine tasks.\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" he said then.Amazon has carried out several rounds of cuts to its corporate division in recent years.It laid off around 27,000 workers over several months in 2022, as rivals similarly looked to reverse hiring increases made during the pandemic.After the company posted its latest financial results in July, its more subdued profit guidance for the forthcoming quarter left some sceptical of whether - or when -  its enormous AI investments would pay off.Slower growth for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, also sparked concern among some investors.Amazon will report its latest results on Thursday for the period ending 30 September.Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said the wider industry would be watching Amazon closely as it embarked on its latest round of cuts.\"We are already seeing jobs in software development be shed thanks to the capabilities of some of these AI tools, and the big companies will be looking to redistribute and restructure their workforces accordingly,\" he told the BBC. \"They have the data and can apply AI in a way that unfortunately means job losses are inevitable.\"Additional reporting by Philippa Wain",

    "body": "Rare earths, Nobel nomination and cheers: Trump ends Japan leg of Asia tour6 hours agoAnthony Zurcher,North America correspondent and Shaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentWatch: Trump addresses cheering troops on US carrier in JapanPraise, Nobel nominations and promises of foreign investment in the US - Japan's newly-elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi rolled out the red carpet for Donald Trump on Tuesday.Trump in turn had warm praise for Takaichi, telling her that the US would be there for \"anything you want, any favours you need, anything… to help Japan\".The two leaders signed a deal on rare earth minerals, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations which reiterated the commitment of the two countries to implement deals struck earlier, including the 15% tariff deal negotiated earlier this year.The pageantry and the venue also seemed tailor-made for the US president.A full military guard of honour and band welcomed Trump to the ornate Akasaka Palace, with its vaulted ceilings and gold-encrusted walls not unlike what the president wants in his planned White House ballroom.Over lunch, Trump congratulated Takaichi for becoming Japan's first female prime minister.Notably, according to a White House readout, that lunch was \"American rice and American beef, deliciously made with Japanese ingredients\" - a move that will no doubt have delighted Trump, who has long demanded that Japan buy rice from the US.China controls the rare earths the world buys - can Trump's new deals change that?Takaichi also accompanied Trump aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, where they were greeted by thousands of cheering American troops. Takaichi took the stage and praised what she called the  \"greatest alliance in the world\" and pledged to increase defence spending.Trump has in the past criticised Japan's lack of defence spending. In April this year, he lambasted a security treaty with Japan as being \"one-sided\", saying: \"We pay billions of dollars to defend them, but they don't pay anything.\"Ahead of their meeting on Wednesday, Trump said he was sure that he would have a \"fantastic relationship\" with Takaichi, who had a strong connection with former PM Shinzo Abe, a Trump favourite who was shot dead in 2022.\"She was a great ally and friend of Abe, who was my friend… He was one of the best… I know they were very close, and I think philosophically they were close, which is very good,\" he told reporters while flying over to Japan from Malaysia on Tuesday.Trump is spending a week in Asia. He will leave Japan for South Korea on Wednesday, and is expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping there on Thursday.Getty ImagesDonald Trump met Sanae Takaichi, Japan's new prime minister, on the visitThe meeting with Trump was seen as a critical early test for Takaichi, who was elected as prime minister by Japanese lawmakers earlier this month.Both countries have long been allies, but navigating a relationship with a fickle Trump, who has in the past appeared to waver in his commitment to Japan, lies at the core of the country's foreign policy.On Wednesday, Takaichi described Trump as a \"partner in a new golden era\", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East. She announced that Japan would be nominating him for the Nobel peace prize.She also presented Trump with a collection of golf-related gifts, according to Trump's assistant Margo Martin.These included a golf bag signed by Hideki Matsuyama, the first male Japanese golfer to win a major golf championship, as well as a putter used by Abe. They also signed two caps printed with the words: Japan is back.In turn, Trump described her as a \"close friend\" and described the US alliance with Japan as a \"beautiful friendship\" that was \"born out of the ashes of a terrible war\". He also announced he had approved the first delivery of long-awaited US missiles for F-35 fighter jets to Japan, which would take place this week.Pleasantries have set a positive tone to the meetings so far,  but behind the smiles and the pagentary, there is real pressure on Japan.During the working lunch, Takaichi presented Trump with a map showing the investments that Japanese companies have made in the US. And during his speech on the USS George Washington, Trump said Takaichi had told him earlier about plans for Toyota to put $10bn (£7.5bn) into building plants \"all over\" the US.But Trump also wants more access to Japan's markets - not just getting them to buy more rice, but also soybeans, and to open its market to US vehicles.Getty ImagesThe US president was hosted in the ornate Akasaka PalaceBut Takaichi also needs to protect domestic industries and doesn't want to anger crucial interest groups at home, like the powerful farming lobby.Tokyo is heavily reliant on exports, and cannot afford a tariff fight especially when it comes to its auto industry. Automakers - the country's largest exporters to the US - faced 24% tariffs and tens of billions of dollars in losses.Tariffs have now been lowered to 15%, in step with rivals in the region such as South Korea.Tomohiko Taniguchi - former special adviser to  Abe - said there were things that Takaichi could draw on from Trump's relationship with her late mentor. He said it was important for Takaichi to be \"straightforward and say bluntly what Japan's national interests are, and to see where those two nations national interests overlap, and always mindful that Japan's safety must be in hands of the Japanese\".But Takaichi won't just have to balance Japan's interests and its alliance with the US – she'll also have to do that while maintaining the country's crucial trade partnership with China.Rintaro Nishimura senior associate at the Asia Group said: \"Takaichi will have to walk a very fine line, maybe tone down some of her more hawkish tendencies on China... but also assure Trump that the US-Japan relationship is the most important.\"",

    "body": "A man accused of killing former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial.Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, told a court in the capital Tokyo that \"everything is true\", according to local media. Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara in 2022.Abe - who was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\" - was struck several times, and died in hospital later the same day, sending shockwaves around the world.The assassination shone a spotlight on links between Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Unification Church, more popularly known as the \"Moonies\".Yamagami is reported to have told investigators he targeted Abe because he blamed the 67-year-old for allegedly promoting the church, which he said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.He alleged his mother made donations, said to total about 100 million yen ($660,000), as proof of her faith to the church.The allegations prompted investigations into the church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings, and led to four ministers resigning.Then, in March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the disbandment of the church, stripping it of its tax exempt status and requiring it to liquidate its assets. But Yamagami's mother - who is expected to be called as a witness - has reportedly not wavered in her beliefs, telling Japanese media that the killing has made her faith stronger, according to the Japan Times.Yamagami's trial is not expected to conclude until January, with the defendant denying charges relating to violation of arms control laws. His lawyer told the court the homemade weapon did not fall into the correct category, Japan's NHK said.Japan, which has very low levels of gun violence, has further strengthened its laws around homemade guns since Abe's killing.",

    "body": "The Indian village which saw the  homecoming of one of the world's oldest rebels15 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentAPAfter more than 60 years, Thuingaleng Muivah returned to his native village in Manipur last weekLast week, a helicopter appeared over the green, folded hills of Ukhrul in India's north-eastern state of Manipur.By the time it touched down on a makeshift helipad outside Somdal village, the crowd had already begun to sing. When the door opened, the crowd surged towards a frail man in dark glasses and a black suit. Quickly, they draped him in a traditional shawl.After more than half a century, Thuingaleng Muivah, India's oldest rebel, had come home.  Now 91, Mr Muivah is the general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), or NSCN (I-M), the most powerful of the Naga insurgent factions that once fought the Indian state in one of Asia's longest-running rebellions - though today the organisation is often regarded as a shadow of its former self.His supporters see him as the keeper of a demand India has never recognised - a separate state for Naga people. His critics remember something else: a movement accused of targeted killings and running a parallel government in Nagaland through \"taxes\" many call extortion - allegations the NSCN (I-M) denies.Nagaland, a largely Christian state wedged between Myanmar and Bangladesh, is home to a people spread across neighbouring Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states. Muivah seeks either full sovereignty or a \"Greater Nagaland\" uniting Nagas across borders, especially in Manipur.Muivah himself was born in what is now Manipur state  - a reminder that the Naga identity extends far beyond Nagaland's borders.This was his second attempt to return home - the first, in 2010, was blocked by the Manipur government, which cited the risk of unrest and security concerns. When he finally made it back with his wife last week, almost the entire village gathered to welcome the Avakharar - the \"eldest father\", as they called him. Among them was his only surviving sibling, 84-year-old Asui Muivah.\"Generation comes and goes, but the nation stays,\" he wrote in a message read aloud by his deputy, VS Atem, as he was too weak to speak himself. \"The issue we are fighting for is greater and older than most of us.\"APHundreds had gathered to welcome Muivah, the general secretary of the most powerful Naga insurgent faction called NSCN (I-M)Muivah had left this same hillside village in 1964, trekking east to join the Naga struggle for sovereignty - a journey that would take him to the jungles of northern Myanmar, the ideological camps of Maoist China and the negotiation tables of Delhi. After coming out of the jungles for a ceasefire in 1997, Muivah has lived in Delhi and a sprawling camp in Hebron in Nagaland, which serves as the NSCN (I-M)'s headquarters, complete with signs declaring, \"Freedom is the birthright of all nations\". \"His return to his village is more personal than political - driven by a longing for home. His calls for a separate Naga flag and a constitution are expected, and they help keep him politically relevant. But the broader idea of 'Greater Nagaland' has largely faded over the years,\" says Pradip Phanjoubam, editor-in-chief of the Imphal Review of Arts and Politics.The Naga struggle predates India itself. In 1918, returning World War One labourers formed the Naga Club to assert a distinct identity. When India became independent in 1947, Naga leaders refused to join the new republic, declaring, \"We are not Indians\", and held their own unrecognised plebiscite for independence in 1951.As armed conflict began to intensify, the Indian government sent in troops in 1955. What followed was decades of insurgency, factional splits and ceasefires. The rebellion claimed thousands of lives, displaced generations and militarised the lush, Christian-majority hills. \"The Naga conflict,\" says political scientist Sanjib Baruah, \"is among the world's least-known but longest-running armed movements.\"Muivah was born in March 1935 in Somdal, where his family often went hungry. Educated at a local Christian school, he was drawn early to the ideas of revolution and Naga nationalism. By his teens, Muivah was already a Naga nationalist, singing \"God Bless My Nagaland\" at school and questioning why his people lived in \"humiliation\" under the colonial government. After studying at St Anthony's College in Shillong and reading Marx, Hegel and Rousseau, he joined the Naga National Council (NNC) - the first political organisation of the Nagas to demand independence from India - in 1964.APPeople waved the Naga flag - the symbol of an unfulfilled political dream - as they waited for Muivah's arrival last weekTwo years later, 31-year-old Muivah joined more than 130 guerrillas on a 97-day trek through the jungles of northern Myanmar to China's Yunnan province. \"We carried our own rice and slept on grass in clearings,\" he said in a 1998 interview. \"I could stand the hunger, but sometimes there was no water to drink.\" They crossed rivers on bamboo rafts hacked through thick undergrowth, and trudged on in subzero cold. Beijing trained the rebels in guerrilla warfare, Marxist-Leninist theory and \"people's war\". Muivah studied briefly in Beijing's College of Diplomacy, visited Vietnam and came back speaking reverently of Mao and Zhou Enlai - though he would later fuse their ideology with a deeply Christian nationalism. He returned to Nagaland after five years.In 1980, Muivah and his comrades Isak Chishi Swu and SS Khaplang founded the NSCN, breaking away from the older NNC that had signed a controversial peace accord with Delhi. Their faction later split again - into the NSCN (I-M) and NSCN (K), led by Khaplang of Myanmar - spawning smaller offshoots across the northeast. At its height, the NSCN (I-M) was the mother of all insurgencies in the region, training and arming smaller ethnic groups and running what India's intelligence agencies called a \"shadow state\" across the hills, according to Subir Bhaumik, a veteran chronicler of the region. The group faced accusations of extortion, killings and human rights abuses.Critics within the Naga insurgency also point to a violent legacy. The Zeliangrong United Front (ZUF) has accused Muivah of ordering \"merciless killings of many prominent leaders\" and carrying out arson in villages \"in the name of taxation or fighting the Indian Army,\" leaving \"common Nagas\" to bear the cost, its spokesperson Louis Gangmei said.Over the years, Muivah transformed from jungle commissar to political negotiator. After decades of exile - in Thailand, the Netherlands and the borderlands of Myanmar -  he entered a ceasefire with India.But his demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution remains a stumbling block. In a interview in 2020, Muivah told journalist Karan Thapar: \"The Nagas will never be part of the Indian Union, nor accept its constitution. There can be no solution without our flag and our constitution.\"The Indian government has offered greater autonomy, but rejects any concession implying sovereignty; the 2015 Framework Agreement, once hailed as a breakthrough, now languishes. \"We have not surrendered our free existence and sovereignty ,\" Muivah declared last week. \"Come what may, we shall defend it to the last.\" APArmed cadres of Muivah's group kept guard as they waited for his arrivalYet over the past decade, as Muivah's health declined and the movement splintered into dozens of factions, the NSCN (I-M)'s once-formidable influence has waned. A younger generation of Nagas, weary of blockades and extortion, now increasingly seeks peace and economic stability. At the same time, experts like Prof Baruah say that the \"proud display of Naga flags in his home village testifies to the vitality and resilience of the Naga movement\"  - a reminder that while its horizons may have narrowed, the sentiment endures.More importantly, he adds, \"even objectively strong states can choose live-and-let-live deals with armed groups rather than trying to disarm and demobilise them\".Muivah says his group has held more than 600 rounds of talks with New Delhi on a Naga homeland since the late 1990s. Yet critics remain unsparing. The Manipur-based ZUF dismissed his return as \"empty-handed,\" arguing there is \"no reason to glorify an individual who failed the Nagas on all fronts.\" Supporters believe he is war-weary, unsure of peace, and still waiting for the political settlement that has defined his life's struggle.As early as 2006, he told Mr Bhaumik, the journalist, \"I am very tired. I feel doubly tired because there seems to be no result coming out of the talks.\" The wait goes on.Additional reporting by Abhishek Dey",

    "body": "Who is Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian leader who helped Trump preside over a 'peace deal'?16 hours agoKelly NgSingaporeGetty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is greeted by Malaysian PM Anwar when he arrives in Kuala Lumpur in October 2025\"I was in prison but you almost got there,\" Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim joked to US President Donald Trump as the cameras rolled.It was a dicey joke - one he quickly moved on from given Trump's less-than amused demeanour - but also arguably one only a veteran politician basking in his recent wins would dare make.He had just signed a deal with Trump to lower tariffs on Malaysian exports to the US from 24% to 19%. Although many other details remain unclear, any assurance that levies will not rise further is welcome amid all the uncertainty. But most important of all, Anwar had secured Trump's attendance at a regional summit whose relevance has been repeatedly questioned. The US president was at the meeting of Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean, in Kuala Lumpur solely to preside over a highly publicised \"peace deal\" between Thailand and Cambodia, which Anwar orchestrated. He also brokered the fragile ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia after deadly border clashes earlier this year - he stepped in after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on both sides if the fighting didn't stop. Some called it a diplomatic victory for Malaysia, while others said Anwar was simply in the right place at the right time - this year, it was the Malaysian PM's turn to lead Asean. But Anwar would argue he waited 25 years for his turn - a turbulent time in the wings, during which he was jailed twice. Tumultuous path to powerAnwar first made his name as a charismatic firebrand student leader who founded Malaysia's Islamic youth movement, ABIM.In 1982, he joined the long-ruling party United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), surprising many who had expected him to steer clear of the establishment.But it proved a canny political move - he climbed up the ladder rapidly and held multiple ministerial posts.Getty ImagesAnwar Ibrahim has for decades waited in the wings to lead MalaysiaIn 1993, he became deputy to then-prime minister Mahathir Mohamad and was widely seen as his heir-apparent. That was until they fell out over the handling of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, which hit Malaysia hard. Anwar was sacked the next year, then jailed for sodomy and corruption - charges he denies to this day, arguing they were part of a smear campaign to remove him as a political threat.In 2004, a year after Mahathir stepped down, Malaysia's Supreme Court overturned the sodomy conviction and freed Anwar. He emerged as the leader of an invigorated opposition, leading it to its strongest-ever performance in the 2013 elections.Less than a year later, while preparing to fight a state election, new sodomy charges were filed against him, sending him back to jail.Getty ImagesAnwar (L) and Mahathir during the 2018 election campaign Then in 2016, in a shock turn of events, Mahathir came out of retirement to run for top office, as then-leader Najib Razak faced  corruption allegations.Mahathir, then 92, struck an unlikely deal with the still-imprisoned Anwar, where he promised to free Anwar if elected, and eventually hand over the PM job to him. Their coalition scored a historic victory in 2018, but the alliance began to unravel as the nonagenarian kept shifting the goalposts for handing over power.In the 2022 election, Anwar's coalition won the most seats but still fell short of the number needed to form a government. After days of deadlock, the king appointed him PM.Some thought his term would be short-lived. But nearly three years on, the 78-year-old has already held on to the job for longer than his three predecessors.Stable but polarisedAnwar's biggest achievement is perhaps the political stability he appears to have brought to a country that has cycled through three prime ministers between 2020 and 2021.\"Malaysia these days is sometimes seen as among the most stable in South East Asia... which has also made it relatively attractive for investors,\" says Syaza Shukri, a political science professor at the International Islamic University Malaysia.But cost of living is rising, as it is in so many other countries. In July, 20,000 protesters took to the streets in Kuala Lumpur demanding Anwar's resignation, over rising costs and a lack of economic reforms.And expensive investments in semiconductor manufacturing and data centres are yet to pay off. That's why the tariff deal with the US was crucial for the export-driven economy. Others accuse his administration of not doing enough to promote a more inclusive Malaysia in the face of rising Islamism. Religious outrage has sometimes spilled into violence in the Muslim-majoirty country, which also has a sizeable ethnic Chinese population. In 2024, a convenience store chain sparked an outcry for selling socks printed with the word \"Allah\" – the Arabic word for God – which many Muslims saw as an insult to Islam. The store was attacked with Molotov cocktail attacks as people called for it to be boycotted and for the company's executives to be charged.Getty ImagesFrustrated with the rising cost of living and lack of reforms, 20,000 protesters took to the streets in July to demand Anwar's resignationIn 2023, a Chinese Muslim restaurant had to publicly apologise after it came under fire over a staff member wearing a crucifix necklace.\"The middle ground for Malaysian politics is no longer a tolerant multiracial Malaysia, but a conservative Malaysia with an Islamic outlook... Anwar's position on political Islam may just move the country to unchartered territory,\" professor of Asian studies James Chin wrote in a commentary published by CNA.Critics also accuse Anwar of favouritism and question his anti-corruption pledges -  in a contentious move, public prosecutors dropped 47 corruption charges in 2023 against a key Anwar ally, the deputy PM.The diplomatic danceInternationally, Anwar has been more successful. As prime minister, he has a deft balancing act ahead to make sure the emerging, economy he is in charge of doesn't get caught between the US and China.He had also invited China's leader Xi Jinping to the summit. Xi had made an official visit to Malaysia in April, after a 12-year gap, but he skipped this week's summit. But Trump's presence was no small thing for South East Asian economies that rely on the US market. It meant other countries, like Thailand and Vietnam, could also discuss details and gain assurances on tariffs - which they would count as a win, for now.    Anwar has been very active on the diplomatic front. Within his first year as PM, he visited all Asean countries, apart from Myanmar, where a civil war has been raging since the army seized power in 2021.It has been one of Asean's most intractable challenges - while Anwar has been praised for speaking up more on the issue, little has changed on the ground, partly because China has the most influence over the military junta. Still, Professor Chin believes Anwar has \"moved the needle a little\" in restoring Asean's relevance.His role in the Thailand-Cambodia ceasefire also boosted Anwar's standing, but these diplomatic wins mean little to ordinary Malaysians.ReutersAnwar (centre), Cambodia's PM Hun Manet (left) and Thailand's acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai attended peace talks in Kuala Lumpur in JulyWhat's resonated at home is his advocacy for the Palestinian cause, which has become louder since the war in Gaza began in 2023.  \"Anwar needs to fly the Palestinian flag to the hilt to satisfy public opinion and fortify himself against attacks from opponents who accuse him of not going far enough,\" says Ariel Tan, coordinator of the Malaysia programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.But Anwar also faces a dilemma because he needs to maintain good ties with Washington, Israel's most powerful ally, Ms Tan says.\"Since Trump's re-election, he has reduced his criticism of the United States' role in the conflict. Engaging the US has become more critical, particularly with the tariff threat.\"The question is, will Anwar be able to balance the demands at home with those abroad, and start to replicate his international success on a local stage?The answer to that will be crucial to his survival in the next election, due in 2028.",

    "body": "1 day agoJohn SudworthReporting from KyivReutersAt the market in Kyiv, people were visibly shaken by the attack on their neighbourhoodFollowing another week of intensive and lethal Russian bombardment of Ukraine's cities, a composite image has been doing the rounds on Ukrainian social media.Underneath an old, black-and-white photo of Londoners queuing at a fruit and vegetable stall surrounded by the bombed-out rubble of the Blitz, a second image - this time in colour - creates a striking juxtaposition.Taken on Saturday, it shows shoppers thronging to similar stalls in a northern suburb of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, while a column of black smoke rises ominously in the background.\"Bombs can't stop markets,\" reads the caption linking the two images.The night before, as the city's sleep was interrupted once again by the now all-too-familiar booms of missile and drone strikes, two people were killed and nine others injured.The implication is clear. Rather than destroying public morale, Russia's dramatic ramping up of attacks on Ukrainian cities is conjuring a spirit of resilience reminiscent of 1940s Britain.When I visited the market - with the black fumes still billowing from the missile strike on a nearby warehouse - that sense of fortitude was evident.But there was plenty of fear, too.Halyna says she believes the situation will get worseHalyna, selling dried prunes and mushrooms, told me she saw little cause for optimism.\"In my opinion, according to the scriptures of the saints, this war hasn't even started yet.\"\"It will get worse,\" she added. \"Way worse.\"A shopper who told me she had felt her house tremble from the force of the blast was still visibly shaken by the experience.Inspiring memes about blitz-spirit are all very well, but for Ukraine the far bigger question is not how to endure this war, but how to stop it.And with President Donald Trump proclaiming his powers as a peacemaker and pushing that question back to the centre of global politics, another term from that same period in history is once again looming large – 'appeasement'.The question of whether Ukraine should fight against or negotiate with an aggressor has been there since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.But more than three years after it launched its full-scale invasion, the war is entering a new phase, and that word has re-entered the global debate.On the battlefield, fighting has reached a brutal stalemate, and Russia is now increasingly targeting Ukrainian cities far from the front line.Its aerial attacks – using ballistic missiles, explosive-laden drones and glide bombs – have gone from an average of a few dozen each day last year to nightly, and often run into the many hundreds.ReutersUkraine has seen an increase in strikes over the past few monthsWhat the Kremlin insists are \"military and quasi-military\" targets now regularly include Ukraine's civilian rail stations, passenger trains, gas and electricity supplies, and homes and businesses.According to UN figures, almost 2,000 civilians have been killed this year, bringing the total since the start of the war to more than 14,000.As well as the human toll, the financial burden is rising exponentially, with the cost of the air defence systems significantly higher than that of the waves of cheap drones being sent to overwhelm them.Just over a week ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky set off for his meeting in Washington with President Donald Trump in optimistic mood.The US, he believed, was running out of patience with Russia.But he was wrong-footed by a surprise Trump-Putin phone call while en route, and subsequent talk of another summit between the two leaders in Budapest.Zelensky's own exchange with Trump in the White House was reportedly a difficult one, with the US president once again repeating his old talking points.Framing the conflict as little more than a fight between two men who didn't like each other, Trump insisted they needed to settle the war along the existing front line.Warning of the risks of escalation, he also refused to grant Ukraine the use of the long-range Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russia.ReutersZelensky's most recent visit to the White House did not go to plan after Trump held a phone call the evening before with Russia's President PutinGregory Meeks, a senior Democrat on the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, called Trump's strategy \"weakness through appeasement\".Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X that \"appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace\".Although the comments from the Ukrainian president were slightly more guarded – having learned the hard way not to criticise Trump too strongly – they implied the same meaning.\"Ukraine will never grant terrorists any bounty for their crimes, and we count on our partners to take the same position,\" Zelensky wrote on social media after arriving back in Kyiv. With Russia making it clear that it wasn't anything like as ready as the US president had hoped to end the fighting - vowing instead to advance on even more territory - the planned summit was put on ice.Washington promptly sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies – a sign, perhaps, of growing impatience with Putin. While the economic impact to Russia is likely to be minimal, it represents a major shift in Trump's foreign policy, having previously said he would not impose sanctions until European nations ceased buying Russian oil.Even if that is the case, it's clear that a large gulf remains between the US and European view of how to end the conflict.It was on firmer ground that Zelensky found himself a few days later, meeting various European leaders in Brussels and later in London.More sanctions packages were agreed and progress was made towards using Russia's own frozen assets to fund Ukraine's war aims, though ultimately no final agreement was struck.Speaking alongside Zelensky in Downing Street on Friday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer promised he would work with his European partners to help provide more long-range weapons to take the fight onto Russian territory.PA MediaZelensky then went on to visit London to meet with several European leadersWith hindsight, it's easy to mock Britain's policy of appeasement during the 1930s. Indeed, some did so even then.\"You could always appease lions by throwing Christians to them,\" Harold Macmillan, a future prime minister and opponent of the policy, once said.\"But the Christians had another word for it.\"And yet we sometimes forget that the man most associated with the policy, then-prime minister Neville Chamberlain, enjoyed significant support from the US, which shared his deep fear of repeating the horrors of the World War One.President Trump appears to harbour similar fears today.The risk of a widening war with a nuclear armed state is not to be taken lightly, as Ukraine increases the effectiveness and frequency of its strikes on Russian oil depots and, in some instances, its power grid.The Russian leader knows this, warning recently that the use of foreign supplied Tomahawks could prompt a response that was \"serious, if not staggering.\"But few Ukrainians I've spoken to this week have any doubt that the lesson of history holds true.\"Russia only stops when it's washed in its own blood,\" said Yevhen Mahda, a professor at Kyiv's National Aviation University.\"Ukraine has proven this. The sooner the West understands, the better for us all.\"At the market, surrounded by gourds and carrots grown in his own garden, Fedir said he had also been jolted awake by the power of the nearby missile strike.\"Putin understands only force,\" he said. \"We need to destroy their airfields and their factories that produce these shells, bombs and missiles.\"The greater risk, he suggested, lies in concessions, negotiations or appeasement – call it what you will – that, however well motivated, only serve to further embolden an authoritarian power.\"Does Europe think he will calm down after Ukraine,\" he asked. \"If he takes Ukraine, he'll carry on.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

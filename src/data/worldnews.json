    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was just days into a seven-year prison sentence for fraud.  Bureau of Prisons records show that Gentile was released on Wednesday, less than two weeks after he reported to prison. Gentile, the former chief executive and founder of GPB Capital, was convicted last year in what federal prosecutors described as a multi-year scheme to defraud more than 10,000 investors by misrepresenting the performance of private equity funds.He's the latest in a string of white-collar criminals whose sentences Trump has commuted.Gentile was convicted in August last year of securities and wire fraud charges, and sentenced in May. His co-defendant, Jeffry Schneider, was sentenced to six years on the same charges and is due to report to prison in January.US attorney Joseph Nocella said at the time of Gentile's sentencing that GPB Capital was built on a \"foundation of lies\" and that the company made $1.6bn (£1.2bn) while using investor capital to pay distributions to other investors. \"The sentences imposed today are well deserved and should serve as a warning to would-be fraudsters that seeking [sic] to get rich by taking advantage of investors gets you only a one-way ticket to jail,\" he said. But the White House says the Department of Justice under former President Joe Biden made multiple missteps - and that investors were aware that their money could be going towards other people's dividends.\"Even though this was disclosed to investors the Biden Department of Justice claimed this was a Ponzi scheme,\" the White House official said.\"This claim was profoundly undercut by the fact that GPB had explicitly told investors what would happen.\"The official also cited concerns from Gentile that prosecutors had elicited false testimony.Trump's commutation of Gentile's sentence does not clear him of his crimes like a full presidential pardon would, and it does not get rid of other potential penalties imposed. So far in his second term, the president has pardoned or commuted the sentences of multiple people convicted of different types of fraud, including wire, securities, tax and healthcare fraud. Last month, he pardoned Tennessee state House Speaker Glen Casada who was convicted of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges.Correction 1 December 2025: This article incorrectly stated that Jeffry Schneider \"remains behind bars\". It has been amended to make clear that he is yet to begin serving his prison sentence.",

    "body": "Four people have been arrested in South Korea for allegedly hacking more than 120,000 video cameras in homes and businesses and using the footage to make sexually exploitative materials for an overseas website.Police announced the arrests on Sunday, saying the accused exploited the Internet Protocol (IP) cameras' vulnerabilities, such as simple passwords.A cheaper alternative to CCTV, IP cameras - otherwise known as home cameras - connect to a home internet network and are often installed for security or to monitor the safety of children and pets.Locations of cameras hacked in the country reportedly included private homes, karaoke rooms, a pilates studio and a gynaecologist's clinic.A statement released by South Korea's National Police Agency revealed that the four suspects operated independently of one another, and did not conspire together.One of the suspects is accused of hacking 63,000 cameras and producing 545 sexually exploitative videos, which he then sold for 35 million won ($12,235; £9,250) worth of virtual assets. Another allegedly hacked 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for 18 million won worth of assets.The two suspects were responsible for approximately 62% of videos posted in the past year on a website that illegally distributed IP camera hacking footage.Police are now moving to block and shut down that website, and cooperating with foreign agencies to investigate its operator. They have also arrested three people who are suspected of having bought and viewed material through the site.\"IP camera hacking and illegal filming inflict immense suffering on victims and are therefore serious offences. We will eradicate them through vigorous investigations,\" said Park Woo-hyun, a cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency.\"Viewing and possessing illegally filmed videos are also serious crimes, so we will actively investigate them.\"Authorities have personally visited or notified victims at 58 locations, informing them of the incident and providing guidance on changing passwords.They are also helping victims delete and block content, and working to identify others who may have been affected.\"Above all, it is crucial and effective for individual users who have installed IP cameras in homes or business premises to remain vigilant and immediately and regularly change their access passwords,\" the National Police Agency said in its statement.",

It is feared that children are among the missing.The landslide was caused by \"erosion\" of the bank of the Ucayali River - the headwater of the Amazon - the country's National Emergency Operations Center said on X.Some 50 people were on board one of the boats, according to news agency AFP.Rescue operations have been hindered by the fast-flowing river waters, a navy official told AFP.Children, teachers and doctors were among the passengers, the Reuters news agency reports, citing Andina.Authorities are working with families gathered at the scene of the disaster to try to determine exactly how many people still need to be found.One of the boats had departed Pucallpa to the north on Sunday and was travelling towards the riverside communities of Caco Macaya, Curiaca del Caco, and Pueblo Nuevo del Caco, local media reports.",

    "body": "One of the four sons of notorious Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán has pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in a US court. Joaquín Guzmán López's guilty plea on Monday comes after US prosecutors pledged last May to not pursue the death penalty against him.   Lopez, 39, is a member of Los Chapitos, a cell made up of El Chapo's children, including his brother Ovidio, who pleaded guilty in July to drug trafficking, firearms and money laundering charges.Their father, who was one of the founders of the Sinaloa drugs cartel, is serving a life sentence in Colorado.US prosecutors say the brothers rose to become the leaders of the drug cartel after the arrest of their father. Lopez was arrested last year alongside cartel boss Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada after landing a private plane in Texas.Officials have said that Lopez helped trick Zambada into boarding the plane, having led him to believe he was travelling to northern Mexico to look at prospective properties for clandestine airstrips.As part of the plea deal, Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the US.Fentanyl, which is over 50 times more powerful than heroin, is the leading cause of deaths in the US for people aged 18 to 45. Lopez's guilty plea comes as the Trump administration faces pressure from Congress to justify its missile strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea. Trump has moved to designate the cartels as terrorist organisations, and says the strikes are needed to prevent drug deaths in the US. Critics have called them extra-judicial killings, and say they may violate international treaties governing war.Meanwhile on Sunday, Mexico authorities announced that they had killed a well-known drug trafficker who was wanted in the US. Pedro \"Pichon\" Inzunza Coronel, who was one of the country's top fentanyl traffickers, was involved in multiple crimes, including \"murders, kidnappings, torture, and violent debt collection for drug trafficking\", according to US Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson.\"These results reflect what our nations can achieve when they work together against those who pose a threat to our citizens,\" Johnson wrote on X.",

    "description": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor ",
    "body": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor for New Jersey - a ruling likely to affect scores of criminal cases in the state.The president handpicked Habba for the role of US attorney this year, but a district court rejected her nomination, so the Trump administration installed her in a role that allowed her to fill in on an acting basis.The appellate judges found on Monday that this tactic, which bypassed confirmation by the US Senate, violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba is the second Trump-appointed prosecutor to be disqualified in recent weeks.\"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" one of the appellate judges, Judge Michael Fisher, wrote in Monday's ruling disqualifying Habba. The BBC has contacted Habba's office, the White House, and the Department of Justice for comment. In a joint statement, three lawyers who had challenged Habba's authority - Abbe David Lowell, Gerry Krovatin, and Norm Eisen - wrote that this marks \"the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions\".The statement continued: \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported US Attorneys wherever appropriate.\"Habba, 41, first joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. She went on to represent Trump in his hush-money trial in New York last year, when he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction. Before Habba took on the role of US Attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as \"unwavering in her loyalty\" and a \"tireless advocate for justice\".Monday's ruling may force the justice department to find a new prosecutor to supervise federal criminal cases in New Jersey. The appellate court's decision came after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey argued that the prosecutor's appointment was unlawful, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.A federal judge ruled in their favour in August. That order had been on hold while the appeals court heard the case. Habba is not the first Trump-appointed US prosecutor to face a legal challenge. A federal judge last week dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that the US attorney in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed as interim US attorney in Virginia. In October, a US district judge disqualified Bill Essayli from his role as acting US attorney for the Southern District of California, finding that he had stayed in the temporary post longer than the law allowed. But the judge allowed Essayli to continue overseeing the office - the most populous US federal judicial district, serving around 19 million people - in his role as first assistant US attorney. Defence attorneys have filed a motion to get that part of the judge's ruling reversed in an attempt to fully oust Essayli. In September, another US district judge disqualified Nevada's lead federal prosecutor Sigal Chattah, finding that she, too, was not lawfully serving as acting US attorney. ",

    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "body": "2 days agoJames Cook,Jerusalem,Paulin KolaandPatrick JacksonEPANetanyahu said a pardon would lead to national reconciliation in IsraelIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the country's President, Isaac Herzog, for a pardon over corruption cases he has been battling.  The president's office said Herzog would receive opinions from justice officials before considering the request \"which carries with it significant implications\".  Netanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He denies wrongdoing. He said in a video message that he would have preferred to see the process to the end but national interest \"demanded otherwise\". The Israeli opposition says he should admit guilt before seeking a pardon.Early this month, US President Donald Trump urged Herzog to \"fully pardon\" Netanyahu. At the time, Herzog made it clear that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.On Sunday, his office released the request and a letter by Netanyahu himself, in light of \"the importance of this extraordinary request and its implications\".It offered no indication of when the president might reach a decision.In 2020, Benjamin Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial:In the first case, prosecutors alleged that he had received gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favoursHe is accused in a second case of offering to help improve the circulation of an Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverageAnd in a third, prosecutors have alleged that he promoted regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder of an Israeli telecoms company in exchange for positive coverage by a news website.Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch hunt\" by political opponents.In Sunday's defiant video message, he claimed that the cases against him were collapsing, but that the process was tearing Israel apart from within.\"I am certain, as are many others in the nation, that an immediate end to the trial would greatly help lower the flames and promote broad reconciliation - something our country desperately needs,\" the prime minister added.Netanyahu said he was being required to testify before court three times a week, describing that as \"an impossible demand.\"A pardon, he insisted, would help Israel fend off threats and seize opportunities by fostering \"national unity\".His political opponents have accused Netanyahu of attempting to conflate his interests with those of the state.Opposition leader Yair Lapid said there could be no pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and Netanyahu's immediate retirement from political life.Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of Israeli forces, said \"only the guilty\" sought pardon.According to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute [alter] their sentence\".However, Israel's High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president can pardon an individual before they are convicted if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters have always supported a  pardon for their leader.But for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.Public concerns over the government's plans for judicial reform brought hundreds of thousands out on to the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 which triggered the most recent Gaza war.In a separate case, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant last year for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant over war crimes and crimes against humanity that have allegedly been committed during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the move as \"antisemitic\".",

    "body": "President Zelensky has said Kyiv's priorities in peace talks to end the war with Russia are maintaining Ukraine's sovereignty and securing strong security guarantees.Zelensky said \"the territorial issue is the most difficult\", as Russia continues to demand that Ukraine give up areas of the eastern Donbas region that it still holds – which Kyiv maintains it will never do.He was speaking after meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, where he joined a call with European leaders including those of the UK, Germany, Poland, and Italy.Meanwhile, Ukrainian and US negotiators finished two days of meetings in Florida as they worked to revise a peace plan viewed as favouring Russia.The White House struck a positive tone on the talks on Monday, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the administration \"feels very optimistic\" about a deal being reached to end the war.Zelensky was more circumspect, posting on X that the talks were \"very constructive\" but there are \"some tough issues that still have to be worked through\".US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who attended the talks with the Ukrainian delegation, is now bound for Russia where he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. They will be joined by President Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.Witkoff has spoken with Zelensky, Macron, Ukrainian chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and is expected to relay the result of the discussions to Putin.Last week Putin said a draft peace plan had been shown by the Americans to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.The initial US-Russia draft peace plan circulated in November sparked consternation in Kyiv and around Europe. As well as being heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, it also dictated how several billions' worth of frozen Russian assets currently held in European financial institutions should be invested and dictated the terms of Kyiv's access to EU markets.But Macron said there was currently \"no finalised peace plan to speak of\". He also insisted that any such proposal could only be worked out with input from Ukraine and Europe.European leaders have scrambled to get a seat at the negotiating table since the peace plan was leaked, and have urged the US to involve them in drafting any future agreement.Macron said that the territorial question could \"only be finalised by President Zelensky\" and pointed out that issues of frozen Russian assets, security guarantees, and accession to the EU needed to involve European nations.But the French leader also praised efforts by Donald Trump's administration to end the conflict, which began in 2014 with Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and was followed by its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\"Now we are waiting the Russian answer: are they ready to stop fighting and make peace? I want to point out that for three, four times the Russians have said no,\" he added. \"So they don't seem in a rush.\"Throughout the year Moscow has appeared to engage with US attempts to end the war or discuss a ceasefire, but several of its demands directly counter Ukraine's sovereignty and are seen as unacceptable by Kyiv. While the question of territory is the major sticking point, the issue of security guarantees for Kyiv has also proved contentious.Kyiv and its European partners are keen for Ukraine to be given security guarantees - such as Nato membership - that would protect it from being attacked again. But Russia vehemently opposes this and Donald Trump too has ruled out allowing Ukraine to join the military alliance.Away from the negotiating table, the war continues.On Monday morning a Russian missile attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro killed four people and injured 40, authorities have said. Unconfirmed reports say a ballistic missile was used in the strike.Videos shared online showed a large explosion occur on the side of a motorway, and local media said an office block, cars and shops were hit or badly damaged.\"We are trying to end this war with all our might and to end this war in a dignified manner,\" Zelensky said in Paris. \"Russia must end this war that it started, it is its war and it is up to it to put an end to it.\"The latest diplomatic push comes as Zelensky is mired in a serious corruption scandal. His chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who had also led the Ukrainian delegation at peace talks, resigned on Friday after anti-corruption investigators raided his home - although he has not been accused of wrongdoing. Two cabinet ministers have also been fired.On Sunday Trump told reporters on Air Force One that Ukraine had \"some difficult little problems\", referring to the scandal, and repeated his view that both Russia and Ukraine wanted to end the war.

    "body": "Venezuela has condemned US President Donald Trump's statement that the airspace around the country should be considered closed.The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\". The US does not have legal authority to close another country's airspace and the Venezuelan statement accused Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\". The US has built its military presence in the area and carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80, without providing evidence. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has said the US actions are attempt to oust him.Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.Some Democratic and Republican members of the US Congress have expressed anger that Trump has not sought legislative approval.\"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer posted on X on Sunday.\"Under our constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said: \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Trump's comments come just days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\", leading to several major airlines suspending flights there. Caracas then rescinded their take-off and landing rights.Venezuela's foreign ministry urged \"the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organisations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression\", in a statement on Saturday. The same day, Venezuela's military conducted exercises along coastal areas, with state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being manoeuvred.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment - the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 - is to combat drug trafficking.Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US is to depose the left-wing Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many nations as rigged.Fellow left-wing President Gustavo Petro of Colombia - who has also faced US sanctions - has said he believed the US was using \"violence to dominate\" Latin America, though other leaders in the region have welcomed Trump's stance.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.",

    "body": "8 hours agoHafsa KhalilWatch: Police confirm four dead in California shootingAt least four people, including three children, have been killed in a mass shooting at a children's birthday party in California, authorities say.The victims were eight, nine, 14 and 21 years old, a spokesperson for the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said. Eleven others were injured - one critically - in the incident at a restaurant in the state's northern city of Stockton.A suspect is still on the loose. Authorities say they believe the shooting may have been \"targeted\" and may have been committed by multiple people.The city's deputy mayor said the attack had occurred \"at a children's birthday party\". Police had previously described the event as a family gathering.Heather Brent, a spokeswoman for the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office, confirmed to BBC News on Monday that the gathering was a children's birthday party. No additional details were provided, but a neighbour told the Los Angeles Times that the party was for a 2-year-old. \"[A] birthday party should never be a place where families fear for their lives,\" Deputy Mayor Jason Lee wrote on social media.The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT on Sunday), and is appealing to anyone with \"information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of the incident\" to come forward.Brent described the incident as \"unfathomable\", adding: \"This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited.\"Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities.\"Stockton's Mayor Christina Fugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\". She added: \"Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.\"On Sunday, the mayor said she would match a $10,000 (£7,569) reward for any information leading to an arrest and conviction. Stockton City Councilwoman Mariela Ponce also offered $5,000, bringing the total bounty to $25,000. People who live nearby told local news outlet KCRA 3 they heard gunshots for about a minute, and that they heard more than one person firing. Sheriff Patrick Withrow, also from the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office, said \"we believe... there appears to be multiple shooters\" but that detectives needed to confirm as much.'My brother died in my arms'''Families should be together instead of at the hospital'', says Stockton's mayorOne man, Emmanuel Lopez, told the LA Times that his brother Susano Archuleta was the 21-year-old man who had been killed, saying he had been hit in the neck and died at the scene.\"I'm just upset right now. My brother died in my arms,\" Lopez told the newspaper. He said Mr Archuleta had been \"full of life and energy\".Mr Lopez also said his 9-year-old daughter had been among those who were injured but survived, having been shot in the head during the assault.Patricia Flores identified herself as the aunt of Mr Archuleta. She was quoted by the BBC's US partner CBS saying: \"He was a good kid and he went to the celebration for a friend of his, it was his friend's daughter, I believe.\"",

    "body": "The abrupt cancellations of several Japanese music events in Shanghai - one of them midway through a song - have sparked criticism among fans, with some calling the moves \"rude\" and \"extreme\".Maki Otsuki was halfway through the theme of hit anime One Piece on Friday when the lights and music went off, after which she was rushed off stage by two crew members.On Saturday, pop star Ayumi Hamasaki performed to an empty 14,000-seat stadium after organisers axed her concert in Shanghai, citing \"force majeure\".This spate of cancellations come as diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Tokyo fester over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on Taiwan.While responding to a question in parliament last month, Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan.Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it.Both sides have since lodged protests against each other, and the rift has also affected daily living in both countries.Otsuki's management attributed the interruption of her performance on Friday to \"unavoidable circumstances\". \"Other than the performance being cancelled, there were no particular problems, and the local staff were very kind and helpful,\" it wrote in a separate statement on Monday, in which it declined interviews on the matter.Her performance was part of a three-day music festival in Shanghai, for which subsequent events were also called off after \"comprehensively taking into consideration various factors\", according to Japan's Kyodo News.The BBC has reached out to Japanese entertainment company Bandai Namco, who is one of the organisers of the festival.Asked about the incident at a daily media conference on Monday, a spokesperson from Beijing's foreign ministry told reporters: \"I suggest you chat with the Chinese organisers.\"Some of Otsuki's fans have made a meme comparing the shutting down of her performance with the shocking removal of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given \"the Hu Jintao treatment\".On social media, some accused the Chinese authorities of taking away its own people's freedom to enjoy culture, in its attempts to sanction Japan. \"What's the point of turning the spearhead toward its own citizens?\" read an X post written in Japanese.\"Don't you care about the audience - they are after all Chinese, right?\" wrote a user on China's X-like platform Weibo. George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, joined the conversation online. \"It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music,\" he wrote in an X post which also included a link to Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. \"Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!\" he wrote.However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. \"How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?\" a Weibo user wrote.Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the \"people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour\" she wrote on Instagram.\"I still strongly believe that entertainment should be a bridge that connects people, and I want to be on the side of creating that bridge,\" she wrote.Two weeks ago, Chinese state media announced that the releases of at least two popular Japanese anime films will be postponed amid the diplomatic row.

    "body": "2 days agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to the Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.The attack employed Sea Baby drones - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Aibek Smadiyarov expressed his indignation with the attack, which he said was the third of its kind.He said Kazakhstan attached particular importance to ensuring a \"stable and uninterrupted\" energy supply.The incident had harmed relations between his country and Ukraine, Smadiyarov added, calling on Kyiv \"to take concrete measures to prevent the recurrence of such situations\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation as the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet US officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

Right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura leads former TV host Salvador Nasralla by just 515 votes, the President of the National Electoral Council (CNE) Ana Paola Hall said in a post on X. Hall also called for \"patience and prudence\" adding that the manual count of ballot papers was still under way. The tie comes amid growing tensions over delayed election results in the country. The website of the electoral council has also collapsed, adding to public fears about problems with the count.ReutersNasry \"Tito\" Asfura is seeking to restore his party's reputation after a series of scandals in recent yearsAsfura has the backing of Donald Trump, who has threatened to cut financial aid to the Central American nation if his preferred candidate does not win. The outgoing president, Xiomara Castro of the left-wing Libre party, was barred by the constitution from standing for a second term. She backed Rixi Moncada.With 6.5 million registered voters in the country, officials said voter turnout was expected to be strong, but no official figures have yet been released.Many Hondurans had a sense that this would not be an entirely straightforward election but few would have foreseen the vote count being this close.The webpage of the electoral council collapsed, apparently from the sheer traffic to the internet site, with the error message only compounding fears among voters of problems with the count. People are keen to avoid an extended period of uncertainty or legal challenges over the result, which could be the case if the numbers remain close.Shortly before casting their ballots, voters at a farmers' market in Tegucigalpa spoke of their desire for change.Nicole Castillo said it was time to forget party loyalty and vote for change\"People must vote based on reality in front of us, and not stay blindly loyal to any party colours,\" insisted walnut-seller Nicole Castillo, adding that she believed that meant acknowledging the ingrained corruption in Honduran politics.Nolvy Oriales, who owns a cheese counter nearby, said that her main motivation for voting was also to stamp out corruption and cronyism.\"I think we need to try someone new, someone who hasn't been in power before, because these last few years have been very, very tough,\" she said.For many, the person who represents a new start is Nasralla of the Liberal Party, who has portrayed himself as the man who will put an end to corruption in Honduras if he is elected.Although he was the vice-president for a time alongside incumbent Xiomara Castro, the two fell out and he resigned. Most know him best from his work as a television sports presenter.Nolvy Oriales's priority is for corruption and cronyism to be tackledThe other option in front of those who wanted a break with the governing Libre  party was Asfura, the candidate favoured by Trump. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the US would be \"very supportive\" if centre-right candidate Asfura won the presidential election.\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Trump added.But the US president's last-minute intervention angered many as they went to the polls.Casting his ballot at a school in Tegucigalpa, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Octavio Pineda told the BBC that President Trump's social media posts amounted to meddling.\"It's totally electoral interference by the US president and we have publicly denounced it as such. We heard his words, but we don't share his views.\"In one social media post, Mr Trump also controversially promised to pardon the disgraced former Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who is currently serving 45 years in a US prison for smuggling drugs and weapons.\"Remember, it wasn't even the Honduran justice system which tried and sentenced our ex-president for drug trafficking. It was the US Attorney General's office itself,\" recalls Minister Pineda.Meanwhile, Asfura has carefully tried to distance himself from Hernández. On Friday he told news agency AFP that he has \"no ties\" with the ex-president, and that \"the party is not responsible for his personal actions\".For now, the vote count goes on, and the tension in Honduras continues to rise.People have bad memories of street violence following disputed election result in 2017 when Juan Orlando Hernández claimed victory in a vote count which was questioned by international observers and the Organisation of American States (OAS). Pitched battles between protesters and the police lead to at least 20 deaths.No-one wants a repeat of those dark days, and people remain hopeful that calm will prevail.Yet some shop owners have reportedly boarded up their businesses and some employees are staying away from work, at least until the drama of the vote count is over, and the name of the president-elect is clear.",

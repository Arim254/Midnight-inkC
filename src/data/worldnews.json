    "body": "12 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGettySussan Ley has been deposed by Angus Taylor (back centre) as leader of Australia's Liberal party The first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, Sussan Ley, has been ousted after just nine months in the job, losing a leadership ballot to her former shadow defence minister Angus Taylor.Ley was elevated to the role after the party suffered a resounding defeat in last year's election, but since then has been plagued by poor poll numbers and infighting among the conservative Liberal-National Coalition.Taylor had announced he would challenge her for leadership of the opposition on Wednesday, ending months of speculation.In a social media post he said his election on Friday was \"an immense honour\" and that he looked forward to working with new deputy leader Jane Hume.Taylor, from the party's conservative faction, won the secret ballot, 34 votes to 17.Shortly after the results were announced, Ley said that she would resign as an MP and step away \"completely and comprehensively from public life\".She told waiting reporters she harboured \"no hard feelings\" towards the new leader although, in an apparent jab at the infighting she has endured, she added that it was important he get \"clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders\".  Taylor, who narrowly lost the 2025 leadership contest to Ley, is a former management consultant who first entered parliament in 2013. He served as a minister under Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison.Ley's position had never seemed secure. The Liberal-National coalition, a partnership dating back to the 1940s, twice split under her leadership, the first time immediately after the May election and the second time just weeks ago.A series of recent polls have also shown the populist One Nation Party - which only got 6% of the national vote last year - overtaking the Coalition to take second place behind Labor. Ley's personal ratings have also been poor.The coalition has largely failed to agree on what caused its crushing election defeat to Labor, which saw the Liberals all but wiped out in the major cities, with disagreements on energy and climate policy in a particular.Reflecting on her time at the helm, Ley said it had been \"very tough\" at times but added: \"I was part of the early punk rock movement in Canberra, I will continue to find wisdom in one of punk's defining themes, a fearless and honest belief in yourself.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGettyPolice detain a protester at a rally in Sydney against a visit by Israeli President Isaac Herzog on MondayThe New South Wales (NSW) Police watchdog will investigate allegations of misconduct against officers after violent clashes with crowds protesting a visit by the Israeli president this week.The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission said it had decided it was \"in the public interest\" to investigate Monday's police operation after receiving a \"significant number of complaints\".Videos that emerged after the rally appeared to show police punching protesters and dragging away a group of praying Muslim men. A state MP was among those who said she was injured.The NSW Police Commissioner has previously defended officers, saying they showed \"remarkable restraint\" after protestors refused directions.The commission on Friday said it would review all available material, including video footage, as well as conducting hearings before delivering a public report to the state parliament.Despite objections from pro-Palestinian groups, the government invited him to Australia after an antisemitic attack at Bondi Beach in December, saying it would help the Jewish community heal.The Palestine Action Group (PAG), which organised Monday's protest, welcomed the investigation and called on Lanyon and NSW Premier Chris Minns to resign.\"The police operation bore all the hallmarks of a police riot, targeting peaceful demonstrators,\" said Amal Naser. \"Genocide is a crime. Protest is not.\"The Australian National Imams Council on Friday said the police conduct had not reflected \"the Australia we know\" and reiterated its demand for an apology.The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) said there must be \"transparency\" and \"consequences were wrongdoing occurred\", adding that the protest exposed \"a disturbing pattern of anti-Palestinian racism\".\"This is not only about one protest nor just about the Palestine justice movement - it is about the shrinking of democratic space and an attack on the fundamental freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly,\" said APAN's Katie Shammas.Immediately after the Bondi attack Minns introduced restrictions on protests and ahead of Herzog's visit announced additional \"major event\" powers effectively giving police authority to shut down areas of the city.Monday's rally took place just half an hour after protesters lost a legal bid to overturn the major powers designation.The rules allowed demonstrators to gather but forbade them from marching. Police say \"a number of melees\" broke out after crowds were ordered to move on from the area.Twenty-seven people were arrested at the protest and nine later charged, while 10 officers were assaulted, police said.In a statement, a NSW Police Force said it will \"work cooperatively\" with the watchdog inquiry.\"The LECC is a strong and independent oversight body, and we respect this process,\" Police Minister Yasmin Catley said in a statement.Minns has previously defended police actions, saying on Tuesday that police had been \"put in an impossible situation\", urging the public \"not to look at a 10-second clip without the full context\". On Thursday he refused to apologise to the Muslim community for police breaking up their prayer, saying he did not believe officers would have done so \"unless it was in the middle of a riot\". Lanyon has apologised \"for any offence that may have been taken\".",

    "body": "20 hours agoAlicia CurryNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer has previously said he denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperateFormer Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland has been charged with \"gross corruption\" over his ties with the US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, police have said.The charge was brought after the Council of Europe lifted Jagland's immunity, which he enjoyed because of his past diplomatic role. He denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperate, his lawyer says.Emails released by the US government are thought to show that Jagland planned solo and family visits to Epstein's homes in Paris, New York and Palm Beach after the billionaire was convicted of a child sex offence.Three of Jagland's properties were searched by Norwegian crime unit Økokrim and he is now expected to be questioned.As well as serving as prime minister from 1996 to 1997, Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent a decade as secretary general of the Council of Europe.Jagland had diplomatic immunity from heading the Council, Europe's watchdog for democracy and human rights, for alleged acts carried out during his 2009 to 2019 tenure.The so-called Epstein files appear to show instances where the late financier covered the travel expenses to his properties for Jagland and his family.The former leader had planned a family trip to Epstein's private Caribbean island in 2014, but it was ultimately cancelled after Epstein fell ill. Jagland also faces allegations that he solicited Epstein's help in obtaining a bank loan in another exchange, although it is not clear whether this materialised, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. Police have not confirmed whether this allegation is part of the gross corruption charge.Mention in the Epstein files - which have been released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) - does not indicate any wrongdoing. Jagland was seen walking out of his home alongside his lawyer in Oslo on Thursday, one of the properties - alongside two in Risør and Rauland - that Økokrim confirmed it had searched. Politicians, celebrities and royals have been caught up in the turmoil after the US DOJ published the latest tranche of files last month, containing millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into the late sex offender - who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. The Nordic country has seen several public figures drawn into the widening scandal, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, diplomats Mona Juul and Terje Rød-Larsen, and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende.Juul's lawyer has said she \"does not recognise the accusations made against her\" and Rød-Larsen's lawyer said he is confident the investigation will clarify \"there is no basis for criminal liability\".The WEF ordered an independent review into Brende - who also served as the Norwegian foreign minister - over his interactions with the paedophile.Brende has acknowledged dining with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019 and communicating with him by email and text, but said he was \"completely unaware\" of his past criminal activity. He added that he welcomes the WEF's decision to launch a review.",

    "body": "10 hours agoToby MannGetty ImagesJapanese authorities say they have seized a Chinese fishing vessel that tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection, in a move that may further fuel tensions with Beijing.The boat was in Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture in the south-west when it was intercepted and its captain arrested on Thursday, according to the country's fisheries agency.\"The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled,\" the fisheries agency said.The seizure is the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat. China has yet to react to Japan's statement. There were 11 people aboard, including the captain who is a 47-year-old Chinese national, the fisheries agency said. Authorities and Japanese media have described the seized vessel as a \"tiger net fishing boat\" with a high capacity.\"We will continue to take resolute action in our enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels,\" Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said on Friday.Thursday's incident comes amid strained relations after Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enraged China in November by suggesting Tokyo would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.China has long insisted that Taiwan, occupied for decades by Japan until 1945, is its territory.It has not ruled out using force to achieve what it calls \"reunification\".In response to Takaichi's remarks, which China's foreign ministry described as \"egregious\", Beijing summoned Tokyo's ambassador and warned its citizens to reconsider travel and study in Japan.That led to a sharp drop in visits to Japan by Chinese tourists, and a subsequent hit to Japanese stocks related to tourism and retail.As the diplomatic spat deepened during the end of 2025, Beijing repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her comments, and its foreign ministry warned Japan to \"stop playing with fire\".Japanese artists touring China have also had shows cancelled and releases of popular Japanese movies have been postponed.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeFBIThe FBI has now confirmed that the masked man seen in the video is a suspect in the case The FBI has released the first physical description of the man believed to have kidnapped Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie. Nancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared in the middle of night from her Tucson, Arizona, home and was last seen two weeks ago. The authorities believe she was taken against her will.The FBI has analysed footage from a doorbell camera outside her home and believes she was kidnapped by a male who is between 5ft 9in (175cm) and 5ft 10in tall, with an average build. It is first time the man in the video has been officially identified as a suspect in the case, which has drawn a huge amount of attention both in the US and abroad.In its latest statement, the FBI said it had been able to establish identifying details after carrying out a forensic analysis. It highlighted the backpack being worn by the suspect in the video, which was released earlier this week, and identified it is a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.A pair of black gloves has also been found during the search for Guthrie, the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS reported on Thursday.FBINancy Guthrie was last seen on the evening of Saturday 31 January when family members dropped her home. Members of her church noticed her absence at Sunday's service and notified her family.Officials have warned she may be in dire health without her medication. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said she was \"not in good physical health\" but had no reported cognitive issues.Since 1 February, the FBI said it had received more than 13,000 tips in relation to the case - including 4,000 in the 24 hours after the doorbell camera footage was released. It is offering money to anyone who comes forward with information about her disappearance and has now doubled the reward from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000. Getty ImagesThe reward for information related to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie has increased to $100,000Earlier this week, a man was detained in connection with Guthrie's disappearance and his home in Rio Rico - south of Tucson, Arizona - was searched before he was released. Speaking to reporters following the incident and said he did not know who Nancy Guthrie was. Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's potential abductors. They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her return. ",

    "body": "22 minutes agoSimon Fraser,Asia digital editor, LondonandYogita Limaye,South Asia and Afghanistan correspondent, DhakaReutersTarique Rahman has been out of the country for 17 years. He has promised democracy will be restoredThe centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has secured a landslide majority in parliament, 18 months after mass protests ousted the country's longest serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The party took more than two-thirds of seats in the historic general election, with Jamaat, the country's main Islamist party, coming second. Hasina's Awami League was banned from taking part.BNP leader Tarique Rahman is set to be the next prime minister and faces huge challenges in getting the economy back on its feet and restoring democracy after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Hasina.Voters also backed sweeping democratic reforms in a referendum held alongside the election.\"I am grateful for the love you have shown me,\" Tarique Raman told well-wishers in Dhaka as he attended Friday prayers. His party has said there would be no victory procession.He was elected to parliament for the first time as one of 212 successful BNP  candidates. The Election Commission put voter turnout at 59.44%.It is a huge change of fortunes for a man who spent 17 years in self-imposed exile in London. He took over as head of his party after his mother, former PM Khaleda Zia, died in December.During his campaign, Tarique Rahman promised that democracy would be restored. Reviving the country's economy, bringing rising food prices under control and creating jobs for Bangladesh's huge young population are the big challenges facing the new government.Repairing strained ties with giant neighbour India is also high up the list of priorities.Within hours of his win, Rahman had received a call from India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi who congratulated him on a \"remarkable victory\".\"As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India's continued commitment to the peace, progress, and prosperity of both our peoples,\" Modi wrote on X.Although the BNP are promising to lead change in the country, the party was criticised for corruption and accused of human rights violations when it was last in government in the early 2000's.Thursday's democratic exercise is a moment of huge potential - and risk - for the country, with one of its two main parties winning such a big victory. Among the constitutional reforms envisaged are prime ministerial term limits, a directly elected upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and increased judicial independence. Greater representation of women in parliament is also in the charter - and judging by the tiny number of successful female candidates in the election, there is a long way to go.  Tarique Rahman will be under great scrutiny to deliver to a very youthful electorate hungry for change, many of whom took part in the student-led protests that resulted in Hasina's downfall, paving the way for the 12 February election.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAnna LamcheReutersThe US Secretary of State is due to address the Munich Security Conference on SaturdayUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has spoken of a defining moment and a \"new era\" as he travels to Europe for a major speech to the Munich Security Conference.Rubio will lead the US delegation at the first major global event since President Donald Trump threatened Danish sovereignty with a pledge to annex Greenland.French President Emmanuel Macron has insisted Europe must prepare for independence from the US, while Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte has stressed that transatlantic bonds are as close and important as ever.The war in Ukraine, tensions with China and a potential nuclear deal between Iran and the US are also on the agenda as the security conference gets under way.\"The world is changing very fast right in front of us,\" Rubio told reporters, when asked if his message to Europeans would be more conciliatory than a year ago.\"We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be.\"At last year's conference, US Vice-President JD Vance attacked Europe, including the UK, for policies on free speech and immigration. His speech triggered a year of unprecedented transatlantic tension.Some 50 world leaders are set to attend this year's event, where European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship will be discussed at a time when  US commitments to Nato have been called into question.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters on Friday she planned to meet with Rubio to discuss the US threats to seize Denmark's semi-autonomous territory from its Nato ally.The US threats have been viewed by many European leaders as a watershed moment that has eroded trust with its biggest ally.Ahead of the conference, eight former US ambassadors to Nato and eight former American supreme commanders in Europe issued an open letter calling for Washington to maintain its support for the Western defensive alliance.\"Far from being a charity\", they said Nato was a \"force-multiplier\" that allowed the US to assert its power and influence \"in ways that would be impossible - or prohibitively expensive - to achieve on its own\".The transatlantic relationship has come under increasing strain following the Republican president's introduction of tariffs and a suggestion in the US national security strategy that European nations may not remain \"reliable allies\" in the long term.Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel told the BBC on Friday that he recognised \"the world has changed\" and that he hoped the \"transatlantic bond\" remains \"solid\". Van Weel said he recognised that the Netherlands needed to \"step up\" when it came to its own security but that his country was making a \"big sacrifice\" to increase its defence spending.\"It will take time before we can really take over [the security] burden from the Americans in Europe,\" he warned. Watch key moments from Vance's 2025 speech in MunichRubio is expected to avoid taking Vance's abrasive approach from last year but, when asked if he was planning to be more conciliatory, he told reporters that Europeans \"want to know where we're going, where we'd like to go, where we'd like to go with them\".Hours before German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was due to open the Munich conference, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told German public TV that the aim was to define jointly what held Nato together and show the US that it needed Europe too.Macron will also address the conference on Friday, having told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month that now was \"not a time for new imperialism or new colonialism\".After a week of turbulent domestic politics, Sir Keir Starmer will also travel to Munich, where he is expected to hold meetings with both Merz and Macron, before addressing the summit on Saturday morning.Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger, in a report ahead of the event, said: \"For generations, US allies were not just able to rely on American power but on a broadly shared understanding of the principles underpinning the international order.\"Today, this appears far less certain, raising difficult questions about the future shape of transatlantic and international co-operation.\"The former German diplomat said the White House's foreign policy \"is already changing the world, and it has triggered dynamics whose full consequences are only beginning to emerge\".Upon arrival in Munich, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the conference would bring \"new steps toward our shared security - that of Ukraine and Europe\".On Friday, Russian media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying another round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US aimed at ending the war would take place in Geneva on 17 and 18 February.Kyiv and Washington have not yet commented.The three countries recently held talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with no apparent breakthrough - although Ukraine and Russia carried out a rare exchange of prisoners of war shortly after the US-brokered discussions ended.

In his address to parliament, Ramaphosa said he had directed the chiefs of the police and army to draw up a plan on where \"our security forces should be deployed within the next few days\". He said the military deployment would start in the provinces of Western Cape and Gauteng, home to the cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg, because of rising gang violence and illegal mining respectively.\"Children here in the Western Cape are caught in the crossfire of gang wars. People are chased out of their homes by illegal miners in Gauteng,\" said Ramaphosa. Authorities blame illegal miners, known as \"zama zamas\", typically armed, undocumented foreign nationals, for their involvement in organised crime syndicates.Ramaphosa ruled out deploying troops to Cape Town just two weeks ago, saying soldiers were trained for combat and not community policing. He did not explain why he changed his mind but there have been increasing calls for him to take action to tackle gang violence.Beyond the military deployment, Ramaphosa announced additional measures to combat crime, including recruiting 5,500 police officers, strengthening intelligence, and targeting crime syndicates.South Africa, the continent's most industrialised nation, has long struggled with entrenched organised crime.Police data shows that an average of 63 people were killed each day between April and September last year.More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Sussan Ley and the glass cliff: Does Australian politics still have a problem with women?9 hours agoTiffanie TurnbullSydneyGetty ImagesSussan Ley was ousted as Liberal leader after only nine monthsWhen Sussan Ley made history as the first woman to take the reins of Australia's Liberal Party, she insisted this was a pivotal moment for the party – or what was left of it anyway.She had broken through the glass ceiling: an invisible, patriarchal barrier which keeps women from positions of power.But to many, Ley's glass ceiling looked an awful lot like a \"glass cliff\", and it felt like it was only a matter of time before she lost her grip and slipped off it.The glass cliff describes a phenomenon where women and other minorities are promoted to leadership roles during times of crisis, setting them up for a high risk of failure. In essence, it says that when women are finally allowed to ascend to the top, it's frequently so they can take the fall.Elected as leader after the most resounding election defeat in the history of the modern Liberal Party and amid internal party chaos, Ley didn't even survive a year.On Friday she was pushed out by Angus Taylor, who argued she didn't have what it takes to turn the opposition's fortunes around. He won a leadership ballot 34 to 17, with Senator Jane Hume elected as his deputy.Ley's backers claim she was never given the chance to succeed, with some saying gender played a role. Her opponents say her demise has nothing to do with that and everything to do with performance.The messy saga has reignited conversations in Australia about its progress towards making its politics look more like its population.'Crisis on every front'Whoever took over as Liberal leader after the Labor landslide in May last year was always going to have a tough job.They had to unify the polarised factions of the party and manage an increasingly toxic relationship with their coalition partner of eight decades, the National Party - a small but vocal and often mutinous cohort of rural MPs.They had to overhaul a policy platform which was comprehensively rejected by voters. And they had to do this while balancing the demands of the more conservative sects of the Coalition with the more progressive desires of voters in the urban areas where they were ravaged at the polls.Then they also had to repair the Liberals' reputation with women, who have deserted them en-masse after a string of allegations of misogyny levelled during the Coaliton's previous term of government, which ended in 2022.\"There was just crisis on every front… it's classic glass cliff,\" says Michelle Ryan, Director of the Global Institute for Women's Leadership and one of the researchers who coined the term.Getty ImagesAngus Taylor has long held leadership ambitionsFrom her very first press conference as leader, Ley was aware of what this looked like.She and her supporters insisted she had been selected exactly for this moment, because she was the right person to lead the Coalition through it.She is a moderate who can appeal to city slickers, yes, but one from a bush electorate who can speak National. She's been in parliament for 20 years and was a cabinet minister for five. With an unusual but impressive resume that includes time as a pilot and a sheep musterer, Ley says she has spent her entire life breaking down barriers, challenging assumptions and making room for herself in places women weren't always welcome.Some critics say the idea of a glass cliff itself is offensive, that it diminishes women's achievements and assumes they can't successfully lead out of a crisis, when in fact many in the community feel women fare better in them.\"As far as political analysis goes, it is just wrong,\" Ley wrote in an op-ed for the Women's Agenda shortly after she took over.\"There is no doubt that all too often women are left to clean up the mess… But when the most successful political party in our nation's history picks a leader, it doesn't do so based on chromosomes.\"I earned my shot.\"Few are saying she didn't. But the Liberal Party famously passed over Julie Bishop in 2018, an electorally popular and long-serving minister who had been the party deputy for 11 years.Getty ImagesMany in the party say Julie Bishop should have been their first female leaderPolitical observers say there was a sense Ley was only keeping the seat warm for Taylor, whose first leadership bid failed by a slim margin after a controversial choice in running mate.The glass cliff phenomenon doesn't paint the true picture of Ley's tenure though, says Niki Savva, a veteran political commentator and former Liberal Party advisor.\"Sometimes I get really impatient with the argument that all this is happening to Ley because she's a woman. She hasn't been given a fair go because she's a woman,\" she tells the BBC.\"Maybe a tiny bit, but that is not the real reason… Sussan Ley is the architect of her own fortunes.\"She promised not to make unilateral calls as leader, which seemingly opened the door to relentless pressure - public and private - from her peers. She promised to listen to the electorate on climate, but facing opposition from the conservative members of the Coalition, rolled back her party's promise to reach net-zero by 2050. And though she played a leading role in pushing the government to hold a royal commission into antisemitism in the wake of the Bondi attack - which she says she's proud of - critics accused her of politicising the tragedy. She also oversaw two short-lived but ugly break-ups between the Liberals and Nationals.\"Political leaders are judged on their performance, not on their gender,\" Liberal Senator, and prominent Taylor backer, James Paterson said on Thursday. \"Newspoll shows she's at negative 39 personal approving approval rating. That is the worst performance of an opposition leader in 23 years.\"The driver behind her abysmal approval rating, Savva says, is her lack of conviction on issues she said she cared about.\"If she had gone out there and staked out her territory, gone out and fought for it, then maybe her position would not be as dire as it is today.\"Ryan, though, argues both things can be true.\"It really isn't about whether Ley is qualified for the job or not… It's not even about her performance in this job,\" Ryan says.\"It's about when is it that the party will put a woman ahead.\"Women still rare at the topJulia Gillard, the nation's first female prime minister, is the only woman aside from Ley to lead one of its two major parties.She said at the end of her misogyny-plagued tenure in 2013: \"Being the first female prime minister does not explain everything about my prime ministership, nor does it explain nothing about my prime ministership.\"It's true that representation in parliament has grown dramatically since Gillard's era – largely driven by her party, Labor, who more than 30 years ago set ambitious quotas, both for selecting female candidates in winnable seats, and promoting them into leadership.While the Coalition party rooms remain about a third female, the Labor caucus is now majority women – 57% – a historic achievement. And there is gender equality in cabinet too.But women are still rare at the very top.Getty ImagesFormer PM Julia Gillard is the only other woman to lead one of Australia's major partiesAnthony Albanese's leadership team is the first from Labor without at least a female deputy since 2001, aside from a three-month blip in 2013. Albanese was part of that woman-less leadership team too.And though Penny Wong is senate leader and foreign minister, women still tend to have more junior cabinet roles or positions in non-cabinet ministries.\"Being able to say we've had a female prime minister, that's great, we've just got to get beyond one,\" Ryan says. \"You have to do it again, and then you have to do it again.\"But over the three decades Labor has used to increase its gender diversity through quotas, doyens of both the Liberal and National parties, even Ley herself, have been arguing they don't need them – to the frustration of many of the women in their ranks.Gender shouldn't matter in politics, they say, something which critics say fails to acknowledge the reality that it long has, and still does.\"Instead of, as a woman, getting out there and arguing for quotas, standing up for them, Ley came out with this line, which I just thought was BS, about being a zealot for getting more women into parliament, but agnostic on quotas,\" Savva says.\"Well, what the hell did that mean? And what did she do about it subsequently? Big fat zero.\"Getty ImagesTeal candidates like Kate Chaney have filled gaps left by the Liberal PartyAnalysts say this reluctance from the Liberals to champion strong female candidates has helped fuel the rise of independents. More than 70% of crossbench MPs in this parliament are women, many of them so-called \"Teal\" candidates who have won in traditionally blue, Liberal seats.Ley, who after the leadership spill announced she would resign from parliament, said there was \"no doubt\" it had been \"a challenging time to lead the party\".\"It is important that the new leader gets clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders,\" she said, a parting jab at her successor.This episode is unlikely to help resolve the Liberal Party's quandaries.Election post-mortems, as well as consistent feedback from polling and interest groups, point towards the desire for a more diverse Liberal Party that reflects modern Australia, and a more cooperative, stable one.At best, recent events show disorganisation and disunity, commentators say. At worst, they're another show of a stubborn Liberal Party reluctant to learn from its mistakes.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentTrump announces rollback of Obama-era greenhouse gas rulingUS President Donald Trump has reversed a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins all federal actions on curbing planet-warming gases.The so-called 2009 \"endangerment finding\" concluded that a range of greenhouse gases were a threat to public health. It's become the legal bedrock of federal efforts to rein in emissions, especially in vehicles.The White House called the reversal the \"largest deregulation in American history\", saying it would make cars cheaper, bringing down costs for automakers by $2,400 per vehicle.Environmental groups say the move is by far the most significant rollback on climate change yet attempted and are set to challenge it in the courts.Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said the 2009 ruling  was \"a disastrous Obama era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers\".\"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history,\" added the Republican president, about the Democrats' climate agenda.Former President Barack Obama, who infrequently comments on the policies of sitting presidents, said that repealing the finding would make Americans more vulnerable.\"Without it, we'll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money,\" he wrote on X. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first took a stance on the impacts of greenhouse gases in 2009, in the first year of Obama's first term.The agency decided that six key planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, were a danger to human health.With a divided Congress unable to agree on legislation to tackle rising global temperatures, the EPA finding became central to federal efforts to rein in emissions in the years that followed.\"The endangerment finding has really served as the lynchpin of US regulation of greenhouse gases,\" said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Department of Justice attorney.\"So that includes motor vehicles, but it also includes power plants, the oil and gas sector, methane from landfills, even aircraft. So it really runs the gamut, all of the standards for each of the sectors is premised on this one thing.\"Trump administration officials are stressing that overturning the regulation will save more than $1tn and will help cut the price of energy and transport.Reversing the finding will reduce automobile manufacturers' costs by $2,400 per vehicle, the White House claimed.These regulations have been an economic strain, said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who served in the US Department of Transportation during the first Trump term.\"The burden on the economy results in higher prices and manufacturing has left. It's gone to China, where it's made in a dirtier way,\" she told the BBC. \"So to say that we're reducing global emissions by ending energy intensive manufacturing in some countries, then having it go to China and India, where it's made in a dirtier way, does not reduce global emissions.\"Many environmentalists are sceptical of the potential cost savings being touted by the Trump team. \"It's going to force Americans to spend more money, around $1.4tn in additional fuel costs to power these less efficient and higher polluting vehicles,\" said Peter Zalzal from the Environmental Defense Fund.\"We've also analysed the health impacts and found that the action would result in up to 58,000 additional premature deaths, 37 million more asthma attacks,\" he said.For some in the US car industry there will be uncertainty about the rollback as manufacturing less fuel-efficient vehicles might limit their sales overseas.\"This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards,\" said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.\"But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars.\"While the reversal will help the White House to roll back climate change regulations, there are likely to be unintended consequences, according to some observers.While working on overturning the finding, the Trump administration also utilised the 2009 ruling to prevent states from passing laws that would be stricter on carbon emissions.The fact that the finding gave responsibility for regulating warming gases to a federal authority was also used to suppress what are termed \"nuisance\" lawsuits, brought by individuals or organisations on the climate question.\"The endangerment finding decision has blocked any number of lawsuits, and has been pretty powerful in keeping plaintiffs' claims out of court ,\" said Meghan Greenfield, now with Washington law firm of Jenner & Block.\"I would expect states and non-profit groups to bring suits, probably primarily in our state courts, to try to figure out where the contours of this new law are.\"John Kerry to BBC: Trump's climate change policy will 'cost lives'Challenging climate science One key argument about the reversal of the endangerment finding will be about the science on which it is based. The Department of Energy formed a panel of scientists to write a report last year challenging widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases.That report underpinned the initial proposal to reverse the 2009 finding.But many climate experts complained that the panel behind the report was unrepresentative and filled with people who were sceptical of the human influence on warming, and that it was inaccurate and misleading.While it's not clear how much the Trump administration will rely on this report to face off any challenges, a federal judge recently ruled that the department had violated the law in the formation of the hand-picked team that wrote it.In fact, a challenge in court on the reversal of the endangerment finding may well be what the Trump administration is now looking for.Many legal experts believe that they want the proposal to be tested in the Supreme Court before Trump's term ends, believing that if they win, the endangerment finding will be consigned to history.\"This is really different as the EPA is exiting the space entirely and wants to do it on a permanent basis,\" said Meghan Greenfield.\"If they were to win that issue as they framed it before the Supreme Court, a new presidential administration could not change that position, in the absence of new legislation.\"",

    "body": "Authorities in Iran have put on a show of strength to mark the 47th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, weeks after they used unprecedented force to put down anti-government protests. The BBC is visiting Tehran for the first time since the crackdown, during which at least 6,490 protesters were killed across the country, according to human rights activists. The BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet says the bunting lining the capital's streets and large crowds of government supporters embody the image of the nation the government wants to see on the streets: Iranians coming out to show their support for the Islamic Republic and the revolution. Our correspondent is reporting from Tehran on condition that none of her material is used on the BBC's Persian Service. These restrictions apply to all international media organisations operating in Iran.",

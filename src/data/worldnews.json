    "body": "4 hours agoNadine YousifWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromOne of the two members of the National Guard who were shot in Washington DC on Wednesday has died, US President Donald Trump said.Sarah Beckstrom, 20, succumbed to her injuries, while the second National Guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, \"is fighting for his life\", Trump said on Thursday evening.Both were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown DC just after 14:00 EST (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Police have arrested one suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old from Afghanistan.The attack has prompted a range of announcements from the Trump administration aimed at curbing migration from Afghanistan and a number of other countries.The two soldiers who were attacked had been deployed to the American capital as part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on what it sees as rampant crime in several US cities.Trump confirmed Ms Beckstrom's death while on a Thanksgiving call with US service members. \"Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we're talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person... She's just passed away. She's no longer with us,\" he said. Trump later spoke to her parents, a White House official told BBC's US partner CBS News.The US president previously said the attack underlined a major national security threat. In the wake of the incident, officials said they would suspend processing all immigration requests from Afghans, and re-examine green cards issued to individuals who migrated to the US from 19 countries.When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.On Thursday, Trump went on to vow to \"permanently pause migration\" to the US from all \"third world countries\", without providing details of his plan or naming which countries might be affected.Victim had volunteered to work at ThanksgivingMs Beckstrom had enlisted on 26 June 2023 and was assigned to the 863rd Military Police Company, 111th Engineer Brigade of the West Virginia Army National Guard. She had volunteered to work in Washington over the US holiday Thanksgiving, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News following the shooting.Jim Justice, a Republican senator from West Virginia, said he was \"absolutely devastated\" to learn of Ms Beckstrom's passing. \"Our prayers are with her family, friends, and fellow guardsmen during an incredibly difficult Thanksgiving Day,\" he said in a statement.\"We are also lifting up Andrew Wolfe in prayer as he continues his journey to recovery.\"Both soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets, an area where many office workers mill around at lunchtime.More than 2,000 troops have been guarding the nation's capital since August, when the president began deploying troops to cities to tackle what he called \"out of control\" crime.Ms Beckstrom and Mr Wolfe were among those who were deployed in August, the West Virginia National Guard confirmed to BBC News.National Guard troops are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.The location of the shooting, just blocks from the White House, meant a number of law enforcement officials arrived quickly at the scene to treat the two victims and apprehend the gunman.The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanSuspect once worked alongside CIA in AfghanistanOfficials said Mr Lakanwal came to the US from Afghanistan in 2021.He will be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, as well as possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro  told a news conference on Thursday morning, before news of Ms Beckstrom's death.\"We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree,\" Pirro had said. \"But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge: murder in the first degree.\"Bondi told Fox News on Thursday that her office would seek the death penalty against the suspect, calling him a \"monster who should not have been in our country\".Mr Lakanwal reportedly came to the US under a programme named Operation Allies Welcome, which offered special immigration protections to Afghans in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. At the time, the Taliban had taken back control of Afghanistan, raising fears of retribution against those who had co-operated with the US. Mr Lakanwal had helped guard US forces at Kabul airport in 2021 as thousands scrambled to escape Afghanistan as the Taliban swept back to power, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC.The suspect had been recruited to Unit 03 of the Kandahar Strike Force. His unit was known locally as Scorpion Forces, operating initially under the CIA but eventually for the Afghan intelligence department known as the National Directorate of Security.Mr Lakanwal was a GPS tracker specialist, the former commander told the BBC, describing him as a \"sporty and jolly character\".His whole unit was moved from Kandahar to Kabul five days before the Taliban entered the capital. They continued to protect the airport for another six days, before they too were airlifted out to the US.At a press conference on Thursday, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Mr Lakanwal's connection to US forces, saying the suspect \"had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces\", before moving to the US.CIA Director John Ratcliffe said he worked with the intelligence agency.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told CBS.Additional reporting by Hafizullah Maroof and Sayed Abdullah Nizami",

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterTicket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday.From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery.The museum's security and management have faced criticism since a brazen heist in October, when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes.An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure.From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum.Non-EU visitors in groups with accredited guides will also have to pay €28 starting next year, the Louvre told the BBC.The price hike is expected to raise between €15m and €20m each year to support the museum's modernisation plans, it added.The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum.There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues.In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026.Macron also said the Mona Lisa would be moved to a new space to deal with overcrowding.Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo.The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros.Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics due to structural concerns.The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration.",

    "body": "At least 10 people have been killed in an Israeli raid on a village in southern Syria overnight, state media reported, in one of the deadliest incidents of its kind for months. It said children were among the dead.Sana news agency said residents of Beit Jinn \"confronted\" Israeli troops, leading to a firefight. Air strikes were also carried out. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops went into the village, on the edge of the occupied Golan Heights, to detain militants who it said \"advanced terror attacks against Israeli civilians\".Six Israeli soldiers were injured in the clashes, it said. Sana said three people were arrested by the troops before they withdrew.The IDF said it targeted the Jaama Islamiya militant group in Friday's operation. It said that when the raid began, \"several armed terrorists opened fire\" on its soldiers, who fired back. Sana said the village was also shelled. Footage released by the IDF shows two air strikes - one apparently on a group of people, and the other on a building.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, said a building collapsed during the operation.The IDF later said \"all of the suspects were apprehended, and a number of terrorists were eliminated\".Sana quoted the director of a local hospital as saying it had received bodies, including five from one family. The director said dozens of people had also been injured in the incident.Israel regularly carries out incursions into Syrian villages, saying it acts to prevent the presence of armed groups.Since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad nearly a year ago, Israel has moved its forces across a buffer zone on the Golan Heights into southern Syria, where a number of anti-Israel groups and cells operate.Israel says it will not allow the Syrian army, which it considers a threat, to deploy there. The US has for months been mediating talks between Israel and Syria for a security agreement in the area between the two sides, but without success.",

    "body": "4 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondent,andKoh EweA Japanese court has ruled the country's ban on same-sex marriage as  constitutional - bucking a trend set by courts around the country that had raised hopes for marriage equality in Japan.The ruling was met with disappointment from plaintiffs and their legal team who had gathered outside the Tokyo courthouse.Japan is the only G7 country that does not fully recognise same-sex couples or offer them clear legal protection. But it's not an outlier in Asia, where only Taiwan, Thailand and Nepal offer same-sex marriages.Ayumi Higashi, the judge who delivered the verdict, said laws on same-sex marriage should first be deliberated in parliament, the newspaper Mainichi reported.Outside the Tokyo courthouse on Friday, the plaintiffs of the lawsuit and their legal team held up signs that read \"unjust verdict\", local media reported.Shino Kawachi, one of the plaintiffs, told local media that the ruling was \"difficult to comprehend\". \"What is justice? Was the court even watching us? Were they considering the next generation?\" she told local media.Her partner, Hiromi Hatogai, said she was \"extremely outraged\" and wondered if the judiciary was \"on our side\". But, she added, they would \"keep fighting\". Amnesty International described the ruling as a \"damaging step backwards on same-sex marriage\".\"The Japanese government needs to be proactive in moving towards the legalisation of same-sex marriage so that couples can fully enjoy the same marriage rights as their heterosexual counterparts,\" the rights group's East Asia researcher Boram Jang said in a statement.The verdict on Friday is the last among six high court rulings on same-sex marriage lawsuits filed between 2019 and 2021, in courts across the country from Sapporo to Osaka to Fukuoka.Among them, five found the ban unconstitutional - though they rejected the plaintiffs' compensation claims.Friday's ruling by the Tokyo high court marks an exception to this series of verdicts, which had been adding weight to the push for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Japan.The cases will next be taken to the Supreme Court.",

    "body": "44 minutes agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editorandJames Waterhouse,Ukraine correspondentGlobal Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesAndriy Yermak (L) has been Zelensky's chief of staff for more than five yearsUkraine's anti-corruption agencies have begun searching the apartment of President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak.One of the two agencies, anti-corruption bureau Nabu, confirmed that its investigative searches had been authorised and said further details would follow.A corruption scandal has engulfed several figures close to Zelensky, though neither he nor his right-hand man Yermak have been accused of any wrongdoing. Andriy Yermak is the president's closest aide and has had his ear throughout Russia's full-scale invasion. He is also Kyiv's lead negotiator in peace talks with the US, but his position has come increasingly under threat from critics calling for him to go.Yermak, 54, confirmed on social media that both Nabu and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) were \"conducting procedural actions at my home\" and had full access to his apartment, with his lawyers on site.\"From my side, there is full co-operation,\" said the chief of staff, who has not been named as a suspect.The searches come at a very awkward moment for Zelensky and his closest ally, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as US President Donald Trump pushes ahead with a draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week.One of the main sticking points for Ukraine is Russia's demand for Ukraine to hand over the territory it still controls in the eastern Donetsk region. \"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.Yermak, who wields enormous influence at the top of government in Kyiv, underlined his leading role in the negotiations when he told The Atlantic website hours before news of the searches emerged that \"as long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory\".However, Putin has been emboldened by minor territorial gains by Russian forces, claiming their offensive \"is practically impossible to hold back\". Meanwhile, Zelensky's own position has been weakened by the domestic corruption scandal, and Russia's president has long questioned his legitimacy as leader. The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine this month, with investigators linking  several leading public figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector.The two anti-corruption agencies, Nabu and Sap, said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.Domestically, the corruption inquiry probe is being welcomed, but internationally it leaves Ukraine's negotiating position in a potentially perilous state.Russian officials involved in the draft peace plan have talked up the corruption claims, which have alarmed European Union allies. Ukraine is a candidate to join the EU and a report earlier this month highlighted doubts over \"commitment to its anti-corruption agenda\".Among Ukrainians, Andriy Yermak's own popularity has nose-dived. MPs from all parties, including his own, have been calling for his sacking, initially for what they saw as his inflated power for an unelected official, but more recently, the burgeoning corruption scandal.Recent polling suggests 70% of the public want him to resign.A number of suspects have already been charged over the scandal that has outraged public opinion because of allegations that money was diverted from key infrastructure projects vital for safeguarding Ukrainian power supplies.Russian attacks have badly damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure and Ukrainians across the country have had to cope with only a few hours of electricity a day.In his interview late on Thursday, Yermak acknowledged that pressure on him to stand down was \"enormous... The case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\". Zelensky has already fired two ministers and several suspects have been detained in the scandal. One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has fled the country. He was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.Despite not being implicated and denying any involvement, Yermak has struggled to distance himself from the scandal.",

    "body": "Runaway nuns can stay in Alpine convent if they leave social media1 hour agoBethany Bell/BBCSister Rita (L),  Sister Regina (C) and Sister Bernadette have gained a substantial following for their social media postsThree Austrian nuns in their 80s who ran away from the old people's home where they were placed have been told they can stay in their former convent \"until further notice\".However, Church authorities say they can only stay if they stop posting on social media.Sister Bernadette, 88, Sister Regina, who is 86 and 82-year-old Sister Rita are the last three nuns at the Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen, just outside Salzburg.The three nuns say they were taken out of the convent against their will in December 2023.In September, they moved back in with the help of former students and a locksmith, angering Church officials.The nuns' superior, Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey, called on them to return to the care home, saying their decision to return to the convent was \"completely incomprehensible\".The nuns' story sparked worldwide interest. Supporters helped them with food, electricity and social media, posting videos of the nuns' daily lives.These feature the nuns at prayer or at lunch, and include Sister Rita's exercise workouts. She was recently given a pair of boxing gloves.The Goldenstein nuns have amassed almost 100,000 followers on Instagram and several thousand on Facebook.Now after almost three months of standoff, a spokesman for the Provost, Harald Schiffl, has told Austrian Press Agency APA that the nuns can stay for now.It follows a meeting earlier this week, where a proposed solution to the standoff was suggested.The nuns could stay at the Kloster Goldenstein, Harald Schiffl told APA, but only under certain conditions.These include giving up their social media activities.Church officials also want the nuns to ensure that the enclosed part of the convent will no longer be accessible to people who do not belong to the order.In return, they will be allowed to stay and be provided with medical care and spiritual support from a priest.BBC/Bethany BellThe three nuns have lived in Schloss Goldenstein for decadesThe nuns have yet to agree to the conditions.\"Now it's up to the sisters,\" Harald Schiffl told APA.The BBC has contacted them for a response.The three nuns have spent much of their lives at Schloss Goldenstein, a castle which has been a convent and a private girls' school since 1877. The school, which started accepting boys in 2017, is still functioning.Sister Bernadette attended the school herself, arriving as a teenager in 1948. One of her fellow students was Austrian actress Romy Schneider, one of the world's biggest film stars of the 1960s and 70s.Sister Regina arrived at the convent in 1958 and Sister Rita in 1962.All three nuns went on to work at the school as teachers for many years. Sister Regina was headmistress.But the numbers of nuns dwindled. In 2022, the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the Reicherberg Abbey, an Augustinian monastery. Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey became the nuns' superior and the community was officially dissolved at the beginning of 2024.The remaining nuns were granted lifelong right of residence, as long as their health and mental capacity allowed.In December 2023, the decision was made to transfer them to a Catholic care home, where they felt unhappy.At the beginning of September, Sister Bernadette, Sister Rita and Sister Regina moved back, helped by a group of former students.The nuns told the BBC at the time that they were determined to stay.\"Before I die in that old people's home, I would rather go to a meadow and enter eternity that way,\" said Sister Bernadette.",

Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has given his full backing to the officers involved, adding that \"terrorists must die\".The video shows two Palestinian men come out of a building with their hands up. They are surrounded by a number of Israeli border guards. They then kneel on the ground. One of them lifts his t-shirt, apparently to show that he is not armed.After a short period, they move back into the building. Border police then open fire, killing them.A joint statement from the IDF and police said forces had been trying to apprehend wanted individuals who had carried out \"terror activities\", including throwing explosives and firing at security forces.\"The forces entered the area, enclosed the structure in which the suspects were located, and initiated a surrender procedure that lasted several hours,\" the statement said.\"Following the use of engineering tools on the structure, the two suspects exited. Following their exit, fire was directed toward the suspects.\"Writing on X, Ben-Gvir said \"the fighters acted exactly as expected of them\".The raid in Jenin is the latest in a months-long Israeli campaign in cities in the northern West Bank, which Israel says is necessary to tackle Palestinian armed groups it says were responsible for attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers. On Wednesday the Israeli military launched an operation in the nearby city of Tubas.Violence in the West Bank has spiked since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which led to a devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza.Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, including members of armed groups and civilians, in the West Bank since then, the UN says. At least 44 Israelis, including soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during Israeli military operations, Israel says. ",

    "body": "Venezuela has banned six major international airlines from landing in the country after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights there.The airlines had temporarily suspended their routes into the capital, Caracas, after the US warned of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.Angered by this, the Venezuelan government issued the carriers with an ultimatum that expired on Wednesday. While a number of smaller airlines continue to fly to Venezuela, thousands of passengers have been affected.The US has deployed a large force to waters off Venezuela, which it says is to combat drug trafficking but which Venezuela's leader has denounced as an attempt to overthrow him. Venezuela's civil aviation authority, which reports to the country's ministry of transport, announced on Wednesday that Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines would lose their landing and take-off rights with immediate effect.In a reference to the heightened US military activity off the coast of Venezuela, it also accused the airlines of \"joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government and unilaterally suspending air commercial operations\".The US has deployed 15,000 troops and the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, to within striking distance of Venezuela.Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near VenezuelaThe US says the aim of the deployment, the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989, is to combat drug trafficking.US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they say were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, they have not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs and many analysts have pointed out that the US deployment is unusually large for a counter-narcotics operation. The Venezuelan government thinks the aim of the operation is to depose President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged. Amid the rising tensions, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued a warning on Friday to flight operators operating in Maiquetía, the international airport serving Caracas. It urged airlines \"to exercise caution... at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".It was in the wake of that warning that the now-banned airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela. An attempt by aviation industry body Iata to defuse the situation - by stressing that its member airlines were keen to restore operations - failed to appease the Venezuelan government.In recent days, both Maduro and his US counterpart Donald Trump have signalled a willingness to hold direct talks.Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said that he \"might talk\" to Maduro, but also warned that \"we can do things the easy way, that's fine, and if we have to do it the hard way that's fine, too\".Maduro, meanwhile, uploaded a video of himself driving around Caracas pointing to Christmas decorations, in what appeared to be an attempt to show that life in the city was going on as normal.",

    "body": "36 minutes agoYang TianandJames FitzGeraldReutersDonald Trump has said he will \"permanently pause migration\" to the US from all \"third world countries\".The US president wrote in a Truth Social post that this would \"allow the US system to fully recover\" from policies that had eroded the \"gains and living conditions\" of many Americans. He did not provide details of his plan or name which countries might be affected.His comments came a day after an Afghan national was accused of shooting two members of the National Guard in Washington DC, one of whom has died. Trump suggested the incident underlined a major national security threat.The president's subsequent announcements represent a further toughening of his stance on immigration.In the wake of the shooting, he promised to remove from the US any foreigner \"from any country who does not belong here\". The same day, the US suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, saying the decision was made pending a review of \"security and vetting protocols\".Then on Thursday, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it would re-examine green cards issued to individuals who had migrated to the US from 19 countries. The announcement did not explicitly mention Wednesday's attack.When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.There were no further details about what the re-examination would look like.Trump's strongly worded two-part post on Thursday night went further, pledging to \"end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens\". Watch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom'Third-world countries'In the post, the president also blamed refugees for causing the \"social dysfunction in America\" and vowed to remove \"anyone who is not a net asset\" to the US.The post, which Trump introduced as a \"Happy Thanksgiving salutation\", was filled with anti-immigrant language. He said that \"hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia were completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota\" and took particular aim at the state's Democratic lawmakers. \"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,\" the president wrote.The phrase \"third world\" is a term that was used in the past to describe poorer, developing nations. The White House and USCIS have not yet given further details of Trump's plan, which Trump did not directly link in his post to Wednesday's attack.The president had already imposed a travel ban on nationals of Afghanistan - and 11 other countries, primarily in Africa and Asia - earlier this year. Another travel ban targeting a number of majority-Muslim countries was enacted during his first term.The Trump response to Wednesday's shooting amounted to a \"scapegoating\" of migrants in the US, argued Jeremy McKinney, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme before Trump's latest comments, Mr McKinney highlighted that the attacker's motive was not known. \"These types of issues - they don't know skin colour, they don't know nationality,\" he said. \"When a person becomes radicalised or is suffering some type of mental illness, that person can come from any background.\"Suspect in DC shooting is AfghanThe flurry of announcements come after officials said that the suspect in the Washington DC shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had come to the US in 2021.Mr Lakanwal travelled under a programme that offered special immigration protections to Afghans who had worked with US forces in the wake of the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. At the time, the Taliban had taken back control of Afghanistan, raising fears of retribution against those who had co-operated with the US. Mr Lakanwal once worked alongside the CIA, the agency's current director has said.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024 and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told the BBC's US partner CBS News. He was arrested after the attack and was said to be not co-operating with authorities. Trump styled the attack as an \"act of terror\".He said the following day that one of the two members of the National Guard who were shot had died.Sarah Beckstrom succumbed to her injuries, he said. The 20-year-old from West Virginia was working in the city as part of Trump's deployment of National Guard members to crack down on crime.She had volunteered to work in DC over the US Thanksgiving holiday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.The second National Guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, was said by Trump to be \"fighting for his life\".FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Peru's former President Pedro Castillo is among two of the South American nation's ex-leaders to be handed prison sentences in as many days.The left-wing leader was given 11 years in jail on Thursday for attempting to disband Peru's Congress and rule by decree in 2022. The gamble failed, and he was impeached and arrested.He was found guilty of \"conspiracy to commit rebellion\" by the Supreme Court, which handed down the sentence at the same time as convicting him.Castillo's sentence comes just a day after another former Peruvian president, Martín Vizcarra, was handed 14 years' in prison for bribe-taking while serving as a regional governor.The centrist politician, who had championed the fight against corruption during his term in office, was found guilty of taking bribes while governor of the Moquegua region between 2011 and 2014.Prosecutors said he received bribes worth more than $600,000 (£453,753) from construction companies who were seeking contracts for public works. Vizcarra has always maintained his innocence.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court acquitted Castillo of two other charges.Dubbed Peru's first poor president, Castillo, a former trade unionist and rural schoolteacher, won power in 2021 on a wave of frustration with conventional politics.His arrest and impeachment sparked deadly mass protests in 2022 among his working-class rural base. The protests were brutally repressed by security forces, leaving at least 50 dead.On Thursday, dozens of Castillo's supporters gathered outside the prison he is being held in to await the verdict, according to AFP.One supporter, Julia Buendia, told the news agency she still believed Castillo was innocent.Vizcarra and Castillo are the latest in a series of former Peruvian presidents to be jailed for misconduct. Ollanta Humala, who served as the nation's president between 2011 and 2016, was found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison earlier this year.Meanwhile, Alejandro Toledo, who governed it from 2001 to 2006, was sentenced last year to more than 20 years in prison for taking $35m (£26m) in bribes from a construction company.Peru has been beset by political crises in recent years.In October, clashes between anti-government protesters and riot police in the Peruvian capital, Lima, left one man and more than 100 injured.The protests came after the current President José Jerí was sworn in on an interim basis following the impeachment of his predecessor, Dina Boluarte.Boluarte was ousted by lawmakers on grounds of \"permanent moral incapacity\" amid soaring crime rates in Peru. Her presidency was overshadowed by several investigations, including a corruption inquiry dubbed \"Rolexgate\", concerning allegations she accepted Rolex watches as bribes.",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has doubled down on his core demands for ending the war in Ukraine, saying Russia will lay down arms only if Kyiv's troops withdraw from territory claimed by Moscow.Putin has long pushed for legal recognition of the Ukrainian territories Russia has seized by force. They include the southern Crimean peninsula, annexed in 2014, and the eastern Donbas region, which Moscow now occupies for the most part.For Kyiv, which has ruled out relinquishing the parts of the Donbas it still holds, rewarding Russia for its aggression is a non-starter.Speaking after Putin's address, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia \"scorned\" efforts \"to truly end the war\".Speaking to reporters during a trip to Kyrgyzstan, Putin accused Kyiv of wanting to fight \"to the last Ukrainian\" - which he said Russia was \"in principle\" also ready to do. He repeated his view that Russia has the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from Donbas, which is made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" he said.Yet Russia's slow gains in eastern Ukraine have come at significant cost of manpower. According to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, at this rate it would take Moscow almost two more years to seize the rest of the Donetsk region. Thursday's remarks were the first time that Putin addressed the hectic diplomatic moves of the last week, which saw the US and Ukraine hold intense discussions over a peace plan reportedly drafted in October by American and Russian officials.The plan, which was heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, was subsequently revised during talks between Ukrainian and US negotiators in Geneva. European representatives were also in the Swiss city.But it is thought it does not address the issue of the occupied territories which - alongside security guarantees for Ukraine - is the biggest sticking point between Moscow and Kyiv.Putin said that new draft plan has now been shown to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.However, he added it was \"absolutely necessary\" to discuss \"certain specific points that need to be put in diplomatic language\".Asked about the possibility of Crimea and the Donbas being recognised as under Russian de facto control but not legally, Putin said: \"This is the point of our discussion with our American counterparts\".A US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week, he confirmed. US President Donald Trump told reporters that Witkoff may be joined in Moscow by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Zelensky said in a video address late on Thursday that Ukrainian and US delegations would meet \"to translate the points we secured in Geneva into a form that puts us on the path to peace and security guarantees.\" The Ukrainian president did not mention any names, but his chief of staff Andriy Yermak had said US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was due to visit Kyiv later in the week.On Wednesday Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement\" between Russia and Ukraine – indicating that any meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss these points was contingent on a peace deal being agreed upon.During his comments to reporters Putin again expressed his contempt for the Ukrainian leadership, which he said he considered illegitimate. There was therefore \"no use\" signing any documents with them, he added.Ukraine has been under martial law since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has therefore been unable to hold scheduled elections. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament voted unanimously to affirm the legitimacy of President Zelensky, whose term in office ended in the spring. Putin also dismissed warnings by European leaders that Russia could attack the European continent within the next decades.\"That sounds laughable to us, really,\" he said.The White House and Donald Trump have sounded optimistic about the recent diplomatic push for peace talks, but Europeans have repeatedly expressed their scepticism over whether Putin truly intended to end the war. On Wednesday European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of upholding a post-World War Two mindset and of seeing the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\" in which sovereign nations could be \"carved up\".",

    "body": "16 hours agoJon Donnison,BBC News, JerusalemandTom McArthur,BBC NewsWatch: Mohammed Ibrahim, 16, reunites with family after release from Israeli jailA Palestinian-American teenager who spent nine months in Israeli detention without charge has been freed.Mohammed Ibrahim was 15 when he was arrested in February in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where he was visiting on holiday from Florida, for allegedly throwing stones at Jewish settlers, which he previously denied.The US state department said it welcomed the news of Mohammed's release.The BBC has contacted the Israeli authorities but has not received a reply.Mohammed, now 16, was taken to hospital for treatment immediately after release, relatives told the media. They said he is, pale, underweight and is suffering from conditions contracted in captivity.In a statement, Mohammed's uncle spoke of the family's \"immense relief\". Zeyad Kadur said the family had been \"living a horrific and endless nightmare\" over the last nine months.\"Right now, we are focused on getting Mohammed the immediate medical attention he needs after being subjected to Israel's abuse and inhumane conditions for months. We just want Mohammed to be healthy and to have his childhood back,\" he said.\"Israeli soldiers had no right to take Mohammed from us in the first place,\" he added.The state department said it would continue to provide consular support to Mohammed's family. \"The Trump Administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens,\" it added.Earlier this week Mohammed's father Zahar Ibrahim told the BBC he was frustrated that the US government was not doing more to get his son out of jail.Twenty-seven US lawmakers had signed a letter to the state department and President Donald Trump, demanding more be done to release him.Mr Ibrahim, a father-of-four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, previously said his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.He had not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February, and only heard what had happened to him in detention through court documents.Mohammed was held without charge in Ofer prison on the West Bank. It is also home to adult prisoners, some of whom have been convicted of serious terrorism offences and murder.There are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.Following Mohammed's release, Mr Kadur said the family would also continue fighting for justice for his cousin Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old dual US citizen who the Palestinian health ministry said was beaten to death by Israeli settlers during a confrontation in July. At the time the Israeli military said authorities were looking into reports a Palestinian civilian had been killed.Mohammed and Sayfollah had worked together in the family ice cream shop in Tampa, Florida. No one has been charged with Sayfollah's killing.\"We expect the American government to protect our families,\" Mr Kadur said.",

The cause of the blaze remains unclear but officials said on Friday that Styrofoam placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its rapid spread.Three people overseeing the renovations are under arrest for manslaughter, and authorities have launched a corruption inquiry.Follow updates on this storyBringing the fire - which spread across seven of Wang Fuk Court's eight apartment blocks - under control involved more than 2,311 firefighters. Firefighting efforts have now ceased. The fire was fully extinguished by 10:18 local time (02:18 GMT) on Friday, the fire department said in a news conference.It also said 89 bodies have yet to be identified, and 16 bodies remain inside the buildings.Authorities said police will begin entering the Wang Fuk Court buildings on Friday to start gathering evidence, and that an investigation will take place over the next three to four weeks.Meanwhile, crowds have been gathering at a nearby community hall that has been opened to families looking for missing loved ones. Relatives are being asked to help with the identification process by bringing in family photos.The Hong Kong government has also set up shelters and support centres for displaced residents. Groups of volunteers have been packing and organising supplies for those affected, including clothing and hygiene products.The blaze started at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, and by 18:22 local time it had been upgraded to the most serious category by fire officials.The fire department said the fire started at a lower level before moving upwards, and reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F).As a result, the blaze reignited in some places after being doused, they said.The fire spread quickly across the separate blocks due to the presence of flammable netting and other materials on the outside of the buildings.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.Twelve other firefighters have also been injured, authorities said.Two Indonesian nationals who had been working on the buildings were also killed in the fire, a migrant charity said. Indonesian and Filipino workers are among those still unaccounted for.Shock has quickly shifted to anger in Hong Kong, as questions grow on who should be held accountable for the blaze.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.Meanwhile, one resident told the BBC that some of the alarms had been turned off by construction workers.Reports of residents' prior complaints over high renovation fees and whether the materials used complied with fire-safety regulations have also resurfaced and are circulating widely online. \"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" a police spokesperson said.Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for around 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse.",

    "body": "Quebec expands secularism law and limits public prayer16 hours agoJessica MurphyTorontoBloomberg via Getty ImagesQuebec Premier Francois Legault's government has passed a number of secularism laws in the Canadian provinceThe Canadian province of Quebec plans to impose restrictions on public prayer and limit the exclusive offering of religion-based menus, like kosher and halal meals, in public institutions.The latest efforts to strengthen state secularism, dubbed \"secularism 2.0\", are part of a new bill introduced by the governing Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) on Thursday, expanding on a 2019 religious symbols law that has fuelled fierce debate throughout the country. The original law prevents judges, police officers, teachers and public servants from wearing symbols such as the kippah, turban or hijab while at work.Canada's Supreme Court will hear a legal challenge of that law early next year. Jean-François Roberge, the minister responsible for secularism, told a news conference in French on Thursday that the bill was \"part of an approach that respected individual as well as collective rights\". The measures proposed in Bill 9 would: extend the ban on wearing religious symbols to staff in subsidised daycares bar \"collective religious practices\" like prayer in public spaces, such as parks, without prior authorisation from municipalitiesprevent students and staff from wearing face coverings in daycare all the way through to post-secondary educationRoberge said the limits on public prayer were in reaction to recent protests in the province, where there has been debate over groups praying at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. \"It's shocking to see people blocking traffic, taking possession of the public space without a permit, without warning, and then turning our streets, our parks, our public squares into places of worship,\" he said. The decision to strengthen the law has already faced criticism from the opposition Parti Québecois, which earlier this week accused the CAQ of creating division in an attempt to bolster support ahead of next year's provincial election. The National Council of Canadian Muslims also criticised the bill, accusing the CAQ of \"doubling down on identity politics and division in a desperate attempt to regain the public's trust\". Since Bill 21 was passed six years ago, the issue of secularism has continued to simmer in Quebec. Last year, 11 teachers - primarily of North African descent - at a Montreal elementary school were suspended after a government report said they had created a toxic environment for students and staff, and largely avoided certain subjects like science and sex education.Quebec Premier Francois Legault said the teachers had tried to introduce \"Islamist\" beliefs and vowed to strengthen secularism measures in schools.In August, a government-mandated committee released a report with recommendations including a ban on religious symbols for daycare workers and the phasing out of public funding for private religious schools.And last month, the Legault government passed a law extending secularism rules to staff who interact with students in public primary and high schools, and barring students from wearing face coverings. NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA sign for the federal Bloc Québécois that reads in French \"I choose secularism\"What is Quebec's secularism law?Bill 21 prohibits public officials in positions of authority - such as judges, police officers, teachers and public servants  - from wearing religious symbols such as the kippah, turban or hijab while at work.It also requires public services to be provided and received with the face uncovered.For Bill 21, the Quebec government invoked the \"notwithstanding clause\" - a part of the Canadian constitution that allows government to override \"fundamental freedoms\" of religion, expression, and association, as well as the right to life, liberty and security of the person, and freedom from discrimination. It essentially serves an opt-out that prevents courts from striking down the legislation on constitutional grounds.Bill 21 does not mention any specific religion and would include symbols worn by a person of any faith, including Christians, and affirms the religious neutrality of the province.But critics argue it targets mostly religious minorities, especially women of Muslim faith. The law has faced a number of legal challenges in Quebec. Canada's Supreme Court has now agreed to take up the case, which will hinge both on the law itself and the use of the notwithstanding clause. The debate over secularism - broadly, the principle that religion and government institutions should be separate - has played a significant role in the province's public discourse for almost two decades. Known in the majority French-speaking province as laïcité, it has been an important value in Quebec society since the 1960s as the Catholic Church's strong influence began to wane in the province.  A September survey by polling firm Leger, commissioned by media outlets Le Journal de Montréal and TVA, indicated that 68% of respondents thought secularism was an important value. Similar legislation to Bill 21 is in place in various countries across the EU.France passed a ban on veils, crosses and other religious symbols in schools in 2004 and on face covering in public spaces in 2010.

    "body": "Pope Leo on first foreign trip says future of humanity at stake from conflict21 hours agoAleem MaqboolReligion editor, travelling with Pope Leo XIVAnadolu via Getty ImagesPope Leo (C) was welcomed to Ankara by Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip ErdoganPope Leo XIV has warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", at the start of his foreign trip in Turkey.\"The future of humanity is at stake, said the Pope, urging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to act as a source of stability because of the need to promote dialogue and stability.The Pope will mark a historic Christian anniversary during his visit to Turkey, before heading to Lebanon days after Israeli airstrikes on its capital, Beirut.The visits had been planned by late Pope Francis, but their main theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.Leo warned that today's wars were like a \"third world war fought piecemeal\", repeating a phrase that his predecessor had himself used several times, referring to conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, Myanmar and elsewhere. Since he became pontiff six months ago, he has conveyed a sense of being extremely measured, even cautious. But on this trip, his powers of diplomacy will be closely scrutinised.A key moment of the trip will take place in the Turkish town of Iznik, the site of the ancient city of Nicaea. Pope Leo and leaders of other Christian traditions will gather to mark the anniversary of an ancient council that took place there 1,700 years ago.  In 325 AD, among other key decisions, more than 200 bishops at the council affirmed the belief that Jesus was the son of God, eventually leading to what is known as the Nicene Creed.Eastern and Western branches of Christianity later dramatically split, but during this trip there will be messages of togetherness and healing divisions.In Turkey the Pope will also visit the Blue Mosque, as both his immediate predecessors Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI had done. He will have meetings with other religious leaders in a gesture of inter-religious dialogue before flying on to the second leg of the trip.EPAThe Pope plans to visit the Blue Mosque in IstanbulThe Vatican says plans for the Pope's visit to Lebanon have not changed following the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut earlier in the week.He will meet more faith leaders and hear from young people in Lebanon, his visit giving a boost in particular to the estimated third of the country that is Christian.On the final day of the trip, Pope Leo will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.Over recent months, though he has spoken out on some issues dear to him such as the dignity of migrants, he has certainly not been as overtly political as his predecessor could be.He has walked such a fine line that in some cases both progressives and traditionalists within the Catholic Church have made the case that he supports their school of thought.It was for similar reasons that cardinals of different persuasions were thought to have coalesced around him at conclave.Pope Francis was seen as a visionary but one who was not overly worried about creating consensus, leaving behind a somewhat divided Church. Pope Leo has so far operated very differently, gently holding on to some of the progressive ideals of his predecessor while paying heed to the views of traditionalists.He has repeatedly called for an end to war, but in a different way to Pope Francis, who memorably made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza to offer his support.ReutersThe Pope met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Presidential Palace in Ankara on ThursdayIn meetings on this trip - with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Lebanese civic leaders - Pope Leo may be drawn to comment on his views on conflict in the region.We may hear something of his impressions at the end of his trip, as it is customary for the Pope to hold a news conference with travelling press on the return flight to Rome.What we will hear more of on this trip is a pope speaking in a Chicagoan accent. Although Pope Leo, who speaks several languages fluently, has mainly given public addresses in Italian up to this point, the Vatican has confirmed that he will speak English throughout the Turkish leg of his trip, with some French too during his time in Lebanon.",

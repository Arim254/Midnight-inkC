    "body": "Rift at top of the Taliban: BBC reveals clash of wills behind internet shutdown1 day agoBBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIt was a piece of audio obtained by the BBC that revealed what worries the Taliban's leader most.Not an external danger, but one from within Afghanistan, which the Taliban seized control of as the previous government collapsed and the US withdrew in 2021.He warned of \"insiders in the government\" pitted against each other in the Islamic Emirate the Taliban set up to govern the country.In the leaked clip, the supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada can be heard giving a speech saying that internal disagreements could eventually bring them all down.\"As a result of these divisions, the emirate will collapse and end,\" he warned.Javid Ashna / Middle East Images / AFP via Getty ImagesSupreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada (centre) has \"absolute power\", his spokesman said - but ministers including Sirajuddin Haqqani (left) and Mohammad Yaqoob (right) have questioned decisionsThe speech, made to Taliban members at a madrassa in the southern city of Kandahar in January 2025, was more fuel to the fire of rumours which had been circulating for months - rumours of differences at the very top of the Taliban.It is a split the Taliban leadership has always denied - including when asked directly by the BBC.But the rumours prompted the BBC's Afghan service to begin a year-long investigation into the highly secretive group - conducting more than 100 interviews with current and former members of the Taliban, as well as local sources, experts and former diplomats.Because of the sensitivity over reporting this story, the BBC has agreed not to identify them for their safety.Now, for the first time, we have been able to map two distinct groups at the very top of the Taliban - each presenting competing visions for Afghanistan.One entirely loyal to Akhundzada, who, from his base in Kandahar, is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate - isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.And a second, made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which - while still following a strict interpretation of Islam - engages with the outside, builds the country's economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school.One insider described it as \"the Kandahar house versus Kabul\".But the question was always whether the Kabul group, made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists, would ever challenge the increasingly authoritarian Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested.After all, according to the Taliban, Akhundzada is the group's absolute ruler - a man only accountable to Allah, and not someone to be challenged.Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.Listen: Audio obtained by the BBC of Taliban supreme leaderIn late September, Akhundzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world.Three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why.But what had happened behind the scenes was seismic, say insiders. The Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada's order and switched the internet back on.\"The Taliban, unlike every other Afghan party or faction, is remarkable for its coherence – there have been no splits, not even much dissent,\" explains an expert on Afghanistan, who has been studying the Taliban since they were established.\"Bound into the movement's DNA is the principle of obedience to one's superiors, and ultimately to the Amir [Akhundzada]. That's what made the act of turning the internet back on, against his explicit orders, so unexpected, and so notable,\" the expert said.As one Taliban insider put it: this was nothing short of a rebellion.A man of faithOnly two confirmed pictures of Akhundzada exist; this one, showing the supreme leader on the left, has been verified by BBC AfghanHibatullah Akhundzada did not begin his leadership like this.Indeed, sources say he was chosen as the Taliban's supreme leader in 2016 in part because of his approach of building consensus.Lacking battlefield experience himself, he found a deputy in Sirajuddin Haqqani - the feared militant commander, then one of the US's most wanted men with a $10m (£7.4m) bounty on his head.A second deputy was found in Yaqoob Mujahid, Taliban founder Mullah Omar's son – young, but bringing with him his Taliban bloodline, and its potential to unify the movement.The arrangement continued throughout negotiations with Washington in Doha to end the 20-year war between Taliban fighters and US-led forces. The eventual agreement, in 2020, resulted in the sudden and dramatic recapturing of the country by the Taliban, and the chaotic withdrawal of US troops in August 2021.Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesThe unexpected fall of Kabul in August 2021 saw thousands rush to the airport in the hope of being evacuated with US and other troops as they withdrewTo the outside world, they were a united front.But both deputies would find themselves quietly demoted to ministers as soon as the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, with Akhundzada now a lone power centre, insiders told the BBC.Even Abdul Ghani Baradar - the powerful and influential co-founder of the Taliban who had led negotiations with the US - found himself in the role of deputy prime minister instead of prime minister as many had expected.Instead, Akhundzada - having shunned the capital where the government sits in favour of remaining in Kandahar, a base of power for the Taliban - began surrounding himself with trusted ideologues and hardliners.Other loyalists were given control of the country's security forces, religious policies and parts of the economy.\"[Akhundzada], from the outset, sought to form his own strong faction,\" a former Taliban member - who later served in Afghanistan's US-backed government - told the BBC.\"Although he lacked the opportunity at first, once he gained power, he began doing so skilfully, expanding his circle using his authority and position.\"Akhundzada has filled his cabinet with loyalists in line with his vision, but those considered the \"Kabul group\" maintain their positions. Here, arguably the most influential members of each group are shownEdicts began to be announced without consultation with Kabul-based Taliban ministers, and with little regard for public promises made before they took power, on issues like allowing girls access to education. The ban on education, along with women working, remains one of the \"main sources of tension\" between the two groups, a letter from a UN monitoring body to the Security Council noted in December.Meanwhile, another insider told the BBC that Akhundzada, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban's Sharia courts of the 1990s, was becoming \"even more rigid\" in his religious beliefs.Akhundzada's ideology was already such that he not only knew but approved of his son's choice to become a suicide bomber, according to two Taliban officials after his death in 2017.And he is convinced that making the wrong decision could have implications beyond his lifetime, the BBC has been told.\"Every decision he makes he says: I'm accountable to Allah, on judgement day, I will be questioned why I didn't take an action,\" one current Taliban government official explained.Two people who have been in meetings with Akhundzada described to the BBC how they were faced with a man who barely spoke, choosing to communicate mainly through gestures, interpreted through a team of elderly clerics in the room.In more public settings, other eyewitnesses said he obscures his face - covering his eyes with a scarf draped over his turban, and often standing at an angle when addressing an audience. Photographing or filming Akhundzada is forbidden. Only two photos of him are known to exist.Getting a meeting has also become increasingly difficult. Another Taliban member told the BBC how Akhundzada used to hold \"regular consultations\", but now \"most Taliban ministers wait for days or weeks\". Another source told the BBC the Kabul-based ministers have been told to \"travel to Kandahar only if they receive an official invitation\".At the same time, Akhundzada was moving key departments to Kandahar - including distribution of weapons, which had previously come under the control of his former deputies Haqqani and Yaqoob.In its December letter, the UN monitoring team noted Akhundzada's \"consolidation of power has also involved a continued build-up of security forces under the direct control of Kandahar\".Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units - bypassing ministers in Kabul.One analyst argues the result is that \"real authority has been transferred to Kandahar\" - something Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied to the BBC.\"All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions - all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties,\" he said.However, \"from a Sharia perspective, he [Akhundzada] has the absolute power\", Mujahid added - saying \"to avoid God-forbidden division, his decisions are final\".Men 'who have seen the world'APKabul (pictured) is the capital, and the seat of government for AfghanistanAmong the Kabul group, unhappiness was growing and alliances were strengthening.\"They [the Kabul group] are people who have seen the world,\" one analyst told the BBC. \"Therefore, they believe that their government, in its current form, cannot last.\"The Kabul group want to see an Afghanistan which moves towards the model of a Gulf state.They are concerned about the concentration of power in Kandahar, the nature and enforcement of virtue laws, how the Taliban should engage with the international community and women's education and employment.But despite advocating for Afghan women to have more rights, the Kabul group is not described as moderate.Instead, insiders see them as \"pragmatic\", unofficially led by Baradar - the Taliban founding member who still commands great loyalty. He is also thought to be the \"Abdul\" referred to by Donald Trump as the \"head of the Taliban\" during a 2024 US presidential election campaign debate. In fact, he was the group's chief negotiator with the US.The Kabul group's shifting positions have not gone unnoticed.\"We remember that they [the Taliban leaders based in Kabul] used to destroy television sets, but now they appear on TV themselves,\" one analyst said.They also understand the power of social media.Former deputy Yaqoob - whose father led the Taliban during its first rule, when music and television were banned - finds himself increasingly popular with young Taliban members and some ordinary Afghans, evident in gushing TikTok videos and merchandise adorned with his face.But no one has been more effective in rebranding themselves than his fellow former deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani. His ability to evade capture as his network orchestrated some of the most lethal and sophisticated attacks in the Afghan war against US-led forces - including a 2017 truck bombing in Kabul which killed more than 90 civilians near the German embassy - elevated him to near-mythical status among supporters.During this time, only one known photograph of him existed - taken by a BBC Afghan journalist.FBIThe bounty on Sirajuddin Haqqani - pictured in his wanted FBI poster, before the Taliban returned to power - was dropped last yearBut then, six months after the US withdrawal, Haqqani marched out in front of the world's cameras at a graduation ceremony of police officers in Kabul, his face uncovered.It was the first step towards a new image: no longer a militant, but a statesman - one with whom the New York Times would sit down in 2024 and ask: is he Afghanistan's best hope for change?Just a few months later, the FBI would quietly drop the $10m bounty on his head.Yet analysts and insiders repeatedly told the BBC that openly moving against supreme leader Akhundzada was unlikely.Arguably the most visible opposition to his edicts had been minor and limited - for example not enforcing regulations like the ban on shaving beards in regions controlled by Kabul group-aligned officials. But larger acts of rebellion have always been considered unthinkable.One former Taliban member emphasised to the BBC that \"obedience to [Akhundzada] is considered mandatory\".Haqqani himself, in his interview with the New York Times, played down any chance of an open split. \"Unity is important for Afghanistan currently so we can have a peaceful country,\" he said.Instead, one analyst said, the Kabul group is choosing to send \"a message to both the international community and Afghans\", one which says: \"We are aware of your complaints and concerns, but what can we do?\"At least, that was the case before the order came to shut down the internet.A breaking pointAFP via Getty ImagesThe internet switch-off began in carefully selected provinces and then expanded to the whole country in late SeptemberThe Taliban's supreme leader is a man with a deep distrust of the internet; he believes its content to be against Islamic teachings, and is so dedicated to his belief that an aide reads out the latest news or social media posts to him each morning instead, his spokesman once explained to the BBC.The Kabul group believe that a modern country cannot survive without it.The supreme leader's internet shutdown order began in provinces controlled by Akhundzada's allies, before it was expanded to the whole country.Sources close to the Kabul group and within the Taliban government described what happened next - an almost unprecedented moment in the Taliban's history.\"It surprised many members of the movement,\" one source said.In short, the Kabul group's most powerful ministers came together and convinced  Kabul-based Prime Minister Mullah Hassan Akhund to order it switched back on.In fact, the group had already made its unhappiness with the edict known before the internet was cut across the country: the group's de-facto leader, Baradar,  travelled to Kandahar to warn one of Akhundzada's most loyal governors that they needed to \"wake him up\" - adding they had to stop being the supreme leader's \"yes\" men.\"You don't tell him the truth openly; whatever he says, you just implement,\" he was reported as saying by a Kandahar insider.His words, the source said, were dismissed. On Monday, 29 September, an order came into the telecommunications ministry directly from the supreme leader to shut everything down. \"No excuses\" would be accepted, a source in the ministry told the BBC.On Wednesday morning, a group of Kabul group ministers - including Baradar, Haqqani and Yaqoob - gathered at the prime minister's office, joined by the telecommunications minister. Here, they urged the Kandahar-aligned prime minister to take charge and reverse the order. According to one source, they told him the full responsibility lay with them.It worked. The internet returned.But perhaps more importantly, within those few days, it was as if what Akhundzada had hinted at in that speech months earlier had come to pass: insiders were threatening Taliban unity.AFP via Getty ImagesThe decision to reverse the order took many by surprise - including Kabul group supportersBut why this order? One expert points out Taliban members have been happy to follow Akhundzada despite disagreeing with edicts like the ones on girls' education.Meanwhile, many of those who had challenged him openly before had paid a price.In February 2025, the then-deputy foreign minister had to flee the country after warning publicly the leadership was straying from \"the path of God\" in \"committing injustice against 20 million people\" - a reference to the female education ban.UN monitors point to at least two others who have been arrested after questioning Akhundzada's decrees on girls' education, in July and September 2025.But there is also evidence of Akhundzada and his allies moving to keep figures like Haqqani close - despite the latter's public criticisms of the supreme leader's consolidation of power.Even so, tipping over from words into actions and so decisively disregarding an order was arguably another step all together.As one expert points out, this time it may have been worth the risk.Their positions come with power and an \"ability to make money\", the expert says. But both depended on the internet, now crucial to both governing and commerce.\"Turning off the internet threatened their privileges in a way that keeping older girls out of education never did,\" the expert points out.\"Maybe that's why they were 'brave' that one time.\"APBeyond primary school, girls and women are denied an education under the TalibanAfter the internet was turned back on, speculation was rife about what would happen next.A source close to the Kabul group suggested the ministers will be slowly removed or demoted.However, the Kandahar insider suggested it might be the supreme leader who backed down \"because he fears such opposition\".As the year drew to an end, it appeared publicly that nothing had changed.The letter to the UN Security Council noted some UN member states \"have downplayed the division between leaders in Kandahar and Kabul as akin to a family dispute that would not alter the status quo; all senior leaders are invested in the success of the Taliban enterprise\".Zabiullah Mujahid, the senior Taliban government spokesman, has categorically denied any split.\"We will never allow ourselves to be divided,\" he told the BBC in early January 2026. \"All officials and leadership know that a split can be harmful for all, for Afghanistan, religiously prohibited and forbidden by Allah.\"However, he did also acknowledge that differences in \"opinion\" exist among Taliban members, but equated it to \"a difference of opinion in a family\".Half way through December, those \"differences\" had appeared to surface once more.Haqqani was filmed addressing a crowd in his home province of Khost during Friday prayers, warning that anyone who \"gets to power through the nation's trust, love and faith and then abandons or forgets the same nation... is not a government\".The same day, Akhundzada loyalist Neda Mohammad Nadem - the higher education minister - made his own speech to graduating students at a madrassa in a neighbouring province.\"Only one person leads and the rest follow orders, this is a true Islamic government,\" he said. \"If there are too many leaders then problems will emerge and this government that we have achieved will be ruined.\"After the dispute over the internet, these recent comments are set against a very different backdrop to those made by Akhundzada in the leaked audio at the start of 2025.Yet whether 2026 will be the year that the Kabul group move to make meaningful change for the women and men of Afghanistan is very much still up for debate.\"As ever… the question remains after apparent disagreement within the Emirate's top tier – will words ever lead to action?\" says one expert.\"They haven't yet.\"Edited and produced by Zia Shahreyar, Flora Drury and the BBC Afghan Forensics team.

    "body": "10 hours agoGabriela PomeroyJEROEN JUMELET/EPA/ShutterstockThe exact cause of the fire is not yet knownA fire that broke out following a large explosion at a house in the Dutch city of Utrecht was caused by a gas leak, officials say.At least four people were injured in the incident, which happened near Visscherssteeg, an alley in the city centre, on Thursday afternoon. Utrecht Mayor Sharon Dijksma said none of the injuries were life-threatening. The cause of the gas leak is unknown but it is not thought to have been caused deliberately.The blaze has since been put out but it took firefighters several hours. Large plumes of smoke were seen rising above the house, and the nearby streets were covered with rubble and glass.One eyewitness told RTL News that they had heard a \"deafening bang\" and that \" everything in the alley was destroyed\".Other people told the Volksrant newspaper that the walls and windows of several buildings were blown out, and many nearby shops were damaged. Local residents were evacuated, while members of the public were advised to stay away from the area. ",

    "body": "Families of people killed in the protests in Iran have told the BBC that the authorities are demanding large sums of money to return their bodies for burial. Multiple sources have told BBC Persian that bodies are being held in mortuaries and hospitals and that security forces will not release them unless their relatives hand over money. At least 2,435 people have been killed during more than two weeks of protests across the country.  One family in the northern city of Rasht told the BBC that security forces demanded 700 million tomans ($5,000; £3,700) to release the body of their loved one. It was being held at the Poursina Hospital mortuary, along with at least 70 other dead protesters, they said. Meanwhile in Tehran, the family of a Kurdish seasonal construction worker went to collect his body, only to be told they must pay a billion tomans ($7,000; £5,200) to receive it. The family told the BBC that they could not afford the fee and were forced to leave without their son's body. A construction worker in Iran typically earns less than $100 a month. In some cases, hospital staff have phoned the relatives of the dead to give them an advance warning to come and get the bodies before security forces can extort any funds. BBC Persian has been told about a woman - who we are not identifying for her safety - who did not know her husband was killed until she received a phone call on 9 January on his phone from hospital staff. They told her she should quickly come and collect his body before security forces arrived and demanded payment for its release. BBC Persian was told about this situation by a London-based relative, who has spoken to her. The woman then took her two children to the hospital to find her husband's body.  She put it in the back of a pickup truck, and drove for seven hours to their hometown in western Iran to bury him. \"I rode in the back of the pickup truck, crying over his body for seven hours while my children sat in the front seat,\" she told her London relative. BBC Persian has also received reports that officials at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra mortuary are telling families that if they claim their child was a member of the Basij paramilitary force and was killed by protesters, the body will be released without charge.The family member told the BBC in a message: \"We were asked to participate in a pro-government rally and portray the body as that of a martyr. We did not agree to this.\"In another case in Tehran, a source told BBC Persian that several families broke into a mortuary to retrieve bodies out of fear they would be taken away by the authorities. \"Several families, fearing that the authorities might keep the bodies or bury them without their knowledge, broke open the morgue door and pulled the bodies out of  ambulances,\" the source told the BBC. The families then guarded the bodies for several hours on the ground in the hospital courtyard to prevent them from being taken away until they could find private ambulances to transport them, the source said. An internet and communications blackout has made it difficult to get a full picture of what is happening on the ground. International human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is not allowed by the Iranian government to report on the ground.Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers and security forces launched a violent crackdown. The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities. According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,435 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 13 children and 153 people affiliated with the security forces or government. It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested.Meanwhile, arrests have continued across the country. Security forces and Revolutionary Guard intelligence units have detained activists, lawyers, and ordinary citizens. ",

    "description": "The first woman to publicly accuse high-profile twins Oren and Alon Alexander of sexual assault was found dead in Australia late last year, according ",
    "body": "The first woman to publicly accuse high-profile twins Oren and Alon Alexander of sexual assault was found dead in Australia late last year, according to new reports. Kate Whiteman sued the men in March 2024, alleging they sexually assaulted her in the state of New York in 2012. Months later they were arrested alongside their older brother and charged with sex trafficking offences.An investigation into the death of Whiteman, 45, by the New South Wales coroner's office has now concluded, finding her death was not suspicious.The Alexander brothers - who deny wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges - will face trial at the end of this month.The coroner's office said they could not provide any further information about Whiteman's death, out of consideration for bereaved family members.It is unclear what role, if any, Whiteman was due to play in the prosecution case. The BBC has contacted prosecutors for comment.A PR representative for the Alexander brothers said they were unaware of Whiteman's death.\"The decision to release this information publicly on the eve of trial invites obvious questions,\" they said.Older brother, Tal, and Oren Alexander have worked for real estate giant Douglas Elliman, listing properties for celebrities including Liam Gallagher, Lindsay Lohan, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. In 2022, they founded their own New York-based firm called Official. Alon worked at the family's private security firm, Kent Security.A day after Whiteman made her accusations, a second woman, Rebecca Mandel, also brought a lawsuit against Oren and Alon, alleging that the pair drugged and assaulted her at a party in 2010. In the following months, a series of other women came forward to news publications with accusations of sexual assault against all three brothers. Many also claimed they were drugged.As of February 2025, the New York Times said that at least 17 women had filed civil lawsuits against one or more of the brothers, with accusations of assault in Miami, Manhattan and even Moscow.All allegations have been denied by all three Alexander brothers.In December 2024, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) arrested and charged all three brothers, who now face more than 10 sex trafficking offences.In their initial indictment, prosecutors alleged that from at least 2010, the three brothers \"worked together and with others to engage in sex trafficking, including by repeatedly drugging, sexually assaulting, and raping dozens of female victims\".At their arraignment in February 2025, prosecutors told the judge they intended to update their case with additional alleged victims, saying they had interviewed more than 60 women who say at least one of the brothers raped them.An attorney for one of the brothers told BBC partner CBS the charges were an \"overreach\" by the government and \"in no way\" amounted to sex trafficking.\"We have no doubt the evidence will prove that these are all false allegations and the Alexanders are innocent,\" they said.They have been held without bail in Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Centre for the past 13 months, with their trial is set to begin on 26 January.

    "body": "In the middle of the night on Monday, Rachel Bloor stirred in her bed to find a heavy weight curled up on her chest.Half asleep, she reached out for her dog - and instead found herself petting a smooth, slithering object.As Bloor retreated further under the covers and pulled them up to her neck, her partner switched on the bedside lamp and confirmed the Brisbane couple's fears.\"He goes, 'Oh baby. Don't move. There's like a 2.5m python on you,\" Bloor told the BBC.Her first words were expletives. The second, an order to evacuate the dogs.\"I thought if my Dalmatian realises that there's a snake there... it's gonna be carnage.\"The dogs secured outside the room - and her husband wishing he was with them - Bloor began carefully extricating herself.\"I was just trying to shimmy out from under the covers... in my mind, going, 'Is this really happening? This is so bizarre'.\"She believes the carpet python - which is non-venomous - had squeezed itself through the shutters on her window and onto her bed below.Once freed from the python, she began casually feeding it back out the way it came in.\"It was that big that even though it had been curled up on me, part of its tail was still out the shutter.\"\"I grabbed him, [and] even then he didn't seem overly freaked out. He sort of just wobbled in my hand.\"The same couldn't be said for her stunned husband, but Bloor herself was barely fazed, having grown up on acreage around snakes.\"I think if you're calm, they're calm.\"Though if it had been a cane toad - one of the country's most damaging, and ugly pests - that would be another story, she said.\"I can't stand them, like they make me dry retch. So if it was a cane toad, it would have scared me.\"All animals and humans escaped from the interaction unharmed.Carpet pythons are constrictors that are common in coastal areas of Australia, and usually eat small animals such as birds.",

    "body": "Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has taken a strong lead in provisional results from Thursday's presidential election, the electoral agency says.The results announced on Friday morning put Museveni in the lead with 76% of the votes, based on results from 45% of the country's polling stations.He is followed by opposition leader Bobi Wine with about 20%. Ugandans voted in a tense national election on Thursday after an often violent campaign, with President Museveni, 81, seeking a seventh term in office. Wine, a pop star-turned-politician, has alleged \"massive\" fraud during the election, which was held under an internet blackout.  He did not provide documentary proof and the authorities have not responded to his allegations. Late on Thursday, Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) party said that the military and police had surrounded his house in the capital, Kampala, \"effectively placing him and his wife under house arrest\".\"Security officers have unlawfully jumped over the perimeter fence and are now erecting tents within his compound,\" the party posted on X. The authorities are yet to comment.Following the 2021 election, in which he garnered 35% of the vote, Wine was confined to his home for several days by security forces. During Thursday's vote, voting was delayed by up to four hours in many polling stations around the country as ballot boxes were slow to arrive and biometric machines, used to verify voters' identity, did not work properly. Some have linked the problems to the network outage. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandLeehyun Choi,SeoulEPA/ShutterstockYoon was impeached in 2024 for his martial law attemptSouth Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will be jailed for five years over abuse of power, obstructing justice and falsifying documents in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024.This is the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to his shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.  Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen.Some of them held red banners that read: \"Yoon, again! Make Korea great again\". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn.On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister.\"The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them,\" the judge said. Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on FridayYoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power.He had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues.South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty.Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in a decisive victory . But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president  retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers.

    "body": "A group of aid workers who were put on trial in Greece for rescuing migrants on the island of Lesbos have been acquitted of all charges.The 24 former volunteers were arrested seven years ago - accused of human trafficking and other offences - and could have faced up to 20 years in jail.They had worked for an NGO that rescued asylum-seekers at risk of drowning between 2015 to 2018, when hundreds of thousands of migrants crossed the narrow straits from Turkey to Greece.Their case was widely criticised by aid agencies and human rights campaigners as an attempt to criminalise humanitarian aid, and was seen as having profound implications for migration policy across Europe.The defendants, who worked for the Emergency Response Centre International (ERCI), included the former Syrian migrant and former competitive swimmer Sara Mardini, who returned to Lesbos to rescue other refugees, and whose story was told in the Netflix drama, The Swimmers.She and the others were arrested in 2018. They were cleared of some accusations, including espionage, in 2023, but their trial on the remaining charges of facilitating the illegal entry of foreigners into Greece, money-laundering and membership of a criminal organisation only began last month.\"All defendants are acquitted of the charges\" because their aim was \"not to commit criminal acts but to provide humanitarian aid\", presiding judge Vassilis Papathanassiou told the court on Thursday.Prosecutor Dimitris Smyrnis had earlier recommended their acquittal, emphasising that \"no independent basis establishing the criminal liability of the defendants has been demonstrated\".During the trial, the court heard evidence from a senior police officer testifying about the defendants' use of an encrypted messaging service, WhatsApp, to share information about the location and state of boats carrying migrants.He testified that information had not been shared with the Greek authorities. But a Greek coast guard officer, Stavros Gagarellis, gave evidence that the volunteers had cooperated closely with his organisation.The judge ruled that \"a communication group on the internet cannot be regarded as a criminal organisation,\" saying: \"Waiting to rescue a human life cannot be considered facilitation of illegal entry. \"None of the defendants attempted to act in such a way as to allow any of the transported persons - refugees or otherwise - to evade inspection by the authorities,\" he added.Zacharias Kesses, the lawyer for Sara Mardini and another defendant, Sean Binder, said after the verdict: \"I'm astonished that it took 2,889 days for the prosecutor to realise that the accusation made no sense whatsoever—something everyone except him already knew.\"Binder, an Irish-German lawyer who, alongside Mardini, was held in pre-trial detention for three months in 2018, said: \"Right now it's a relief and anger cocktail, equally balanced. I am obviously very relieved that I'm not going back to prison. But I'm also very angry that it's taken this long to get here.\"Binder, now 31, has also spoken of how the allegations had affected his life: \"I've spent the past seven years in limbo. I had hoped to have a job, a career, some savings by now. I'd have hoped to be able to be a father.  I'm trained as a lawyer, but I wasn't allowed to represent my clients until I was acquitted.\"Eve Geddie of the human rights organisation Amnesty International said: \"We hope today's decision sends a strong signal to Greece and other European countries that solidarity, compassion and defending human rights should be protected and celebrated, not punished.\"A BBC radio documentary on the case, \"Assignment: Greece-Rescuers on Trial\" will be broadcast on BBC World Service on Tuesday, January 20, and will available on BBC Sounds.",

    "body": "20 hours agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentAn aircraft that crashed in flames in Kentucky in November had a structural flaw  that had been identified by Boeing on similar planes 15 years ago, according to investigators.The MD-11F freighter operated by UPS, crashed after one of its engines separated from the wing as it was preparing to take off from Louisville.The plane briefly lifted off from the runway, before hurtling out of control into an industrial area. Fifteen people died as a result, including three crew and 12 on the ground.In an update report, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that cracks found in the engine mounting assembly had previously occurred on several other aircraft.At the time the manufacturer responsible for the aircraft, Boeing, concluded that the issue \"would not result in a safety of flight condition\".The MD-11 is a relatively elderly design that was originally produced by McDonnell Douglas.  Boeing acquired the company in 1997.The last MD-11 came off the production line in 2001, but Boeing has continued providing parts and service support.In the aftermath of the Kentucky disaster, the NTSB issued a preliminary report which drew attention to cracks in the engine attachment mechanism. Its latest update goes further, describing fractures due to evidence of \"fatigue\" – or repeated stresses - in a critical bearing, as well as the mounting it is meant to sit in.It points out that Boeing had previously found failures of the same part on four occasions, affecting three different aircraft. In 2011, the company sent a \"service letter\" to operators warning them of its findings. This is a non legally-binding document used to alert operators about important safety or maintenance information.In this case, Boeing recommended that the part be included in a general visual inspection every five years. It also pointed out changes to the inspection procedure contained in the aircraft maintenance manual, and drew attention to a revised bearing assembly that could be fitted – although this was not mandatory.Tim Atkinson, a former air accident investigator who now works as an aviation safety consultant, said the NTSB's update made disturbing reading.\"The structure concerned is not decorative, it's an essential part of the mechanism that attaches the engine to the wing, and carries loads such as thrust and drag,\" he explained.\"It's extraordinary that Boeing concluded that a failure of this part would not have safety consequences,\" he claimed.Boeing's internal processes have come under fire on a number of occasions in recent years.Criticisms have focused on how the design of its 737 Max included flawed software that was implicated in two accidents, in 2018 and 2019, that together cost 346 lives.Quality controls in its factories have also come under scrutiny, after a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off in early 2024.In a statement, Boeing said: \"We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected.\"The NTSB's investigation is continuing. It has not yet issued any firm conclusions about the cause of the accident, and is unlikely to do so until it publishes its final report.",

    "body": "Ethiopian police say they have seized thousands of rounds of ammunition sent by Eritrea to a violent armed rebel group, stoking fears of renewed armed conflict.Eritrea has denied the allegation and accused Ethiopia of \"floating false flags to justify the war that it has been itching to unleash for two long years\".It comes at a volatile moment for the relationship between the Horn of Africa neighbours, which share a fractious and violent history. Hopes of tentative peace, forged during a 2020-22 civil war in northern Ethiopia, have of late given way to a war of words over control of the Red Sea. This latest claim appears to be a sign of further escalation.On Wednesday, Ethiopian police said in a Facebook statement that they had seized \"more than 56,000 rounds of ammunition\" in the Amhara region intended to \"arm the Fano\" rebels, and had arrested two suspects.\"The preliminary investigation conducted on the two suspects who were caught red-handed has confirmed that the ammunition was sent by the Shabiya government\" - a term for Eritrea's ruling party - they said.Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel denied the claim and accused Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Prosperity Party (PP) of seeking a pretext to attack.Relations between the two countries have frequently been strained. After a decades-long battle for independence, Eritrea, which has a 1,350km (840-mile) Red Sea coastline, officially seceded from Ethiopia in 1993, leaving it landlocked.Five years later, a border war erupted in which more than 100,000 people died.In 2018, the two nations signed an historic declaration to normalise relations. Eritrean troops then fought in support of the Ethiopia government during the civil war that broke out in Ethiopia's Tigray region.But relations soured when Eritrea was excluded from the peace deal that ended the conflict in November 2022.In the three years since, Ethiopia's government has been grappling with a violent insurgency, waged by the Fano rebels, who now control large parts of its northern Amhara region.Eritrea has previously denied meddling in Ethiopian affairs.Ethiopia's calls for access to the Red Sea through Eritrea have caused relations with Eritrea to further strrain in recent months.Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy first openly declared in 2023 that his nation's access to the sea was an existential matter, which Eritrea dismissed.In an interview earlier this week with state-run media, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki accused Abiy's party had declaring war on his country. He said Eritrea did not want war, but added: \"We know how to defend our nation.\"Abiy has said Ethiopia does not seek conflict with Eritrea and wants to address the issue of sea access through dialogue.",

    "body": "9 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondent, Beijing When Daidai realised her father was too old to slaughter two pigs for a traditional community feast in the run-up to Chinese New Year, she turned to social media.She didn't want him to feel bad.\"Can anyone help me?\" she asked on Douyin, China's version of Tiktok, at the end of last week. \"My father is old. I am worried that he can't handle these pigs.\"Daidai, who's in her 20s, promised that those who came to their village, Qingfu, to assist would be treated to a pork banquet.In rural Sichuan and Chongqing, large community meals are an important part of culture, featuring twice-cooked pork, steamed ribs, soup and homemade liquor.\"Let me hold my head up high in our village,\" she said.Her appeal for help attracted more than a million likes and the response on the ground was like a scene from a cheesy feel-good movie, as thousands of cars poured in, carrying many more people than she needed for the task.So many responded that traffic jams have brought roads in this part of rural Chongqing in south-west China to a standstill. Drone images show carloads of people queuing up with rice crops on either side hoping to still enter Qingfu. Walking in from long distances has been a traffic-beating option for some.Daidai posted that drivers coming into the area should be careful on the roads, especially those from the city unaccustomed to conditions in the countryside.\"The atmosphere has been great. It reminded me of my childhood when my family still kept pigs. It has been years since I felt anything like that,\" one man, who drove more than 100 kilometres (65 miles) to get there, told the BBC.He has seen licence plates from all over the country, he said.When the pig slaughter and subsequent mass banquet did happen, it was watched live online by more than 100,000 viewers, registering 20 million likes, and the local government embraced it as a flash-tourism moment.With many more people in town than two pigs could feed, tourism officials donated more pigs to meet the huge demand, and small restaurants have been serving crowds of visitors in outdoor seating areas.Yet what this phenomenon has shown is how quickly a small matter can become something massive in the age of social media.\"I thought maybe a dozen people would come,\" Daidai told Chinese media. \"But there have been too many to count.\"The response has also been driven by what seems to be a yearning from Chinese people to get back in touch with community cultural events, as well as a need for positive experiences when life can, at times, seem very dark.Daidai couldn't believe how quickly it's all happened. Last Friday she posted her request for help. By Saturday the response was so large that she went to the police to warn them that there could be disruption in the village and extra officers were brought in to manage the situation.The banquet celebration, by then huge in size, went on for two days – 1,000 diners on 11 January became 2,000 the next day – with bonfires into the night and much partying, accompanied by a band.Eventually, Daidai posted that her celebration was over, urging any more visitors to enjoy the region but not visit her home. After sleeping for only four hours over two days, she said she was exhausted.However, it had been an incredible moment for her and her village.To all the strangers who answered her call she said, \"without your enthusiasm and passion, there would not have been a feast like this\".\"For everyone who came, the feeling was like that of a big family. It was really warm, really healing and really meaningful.\"She thanked government officials and the police for allowing a sudden celebration of this size to proceed.It is already being predicted that the now famous Hechuan region, where her village is located, may try to turn this into a regular event, to tap into the enthusiasm for genuine, grass-roots interaction in a world where many feel isolated and removed from their culture.One villager was quoted in the People's Daily as saying: \"Here neighbours help each other. Today I might help you slaughter a pig at your place, tomorrow you will come to my place to do the same.\"As for Daidai's father, she said in an interview: \"My dad is very happy. Seeing this many people arrive he had to borrow tables and chairs from other villagers. We've never experienced anything like this.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoBrajesh UpadhyayandNatalie ShermanThe US has seized a sixth tanker in the Caribbean Sea in its ongoing efforts to control exports of Venezuelan oil, officials say.The vessel, Veronica, was boarded in a predawn operation \"without incident\" as it was defying President Donald Trump's \"quarantine of sanctioned vessels\",  said the US military.\"The only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully,\" the Southern Command said.Since the US military strikes on Venezuela and seizure of its president Nicolás Maduro this month, Trump has said he plans to tap into the country's huge oil reserves. \"The Veronica is the latest tanker operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean,\" US Southern Command said in a post on social media.It also posted a video showing Marines and sailors boarding the tanker.Veronica, a crude oil tanker sailing under a Guyanese flag, departed empty from Venezuelan waters in early January, according to monitoring service TankerTrackers.com. The International Maritime Organization's database shows the vessel was previously registered in Russia under different names.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media that Thursday's tanker seizure was carried out with \"close coordination with our colleagues\" in the military as well as the state and justice departments.\"Our heroic Coast Guard men and women once again ensured a flawlessly executed operation, in accordance with international law,\" Noem added.It suggests Washington's crackdown on the so-called dark fleet, comprising more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned oil, will continue as the US works with Venezuela's interim government to control the country's oil sales.It also comes a day after an American official said the US had completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500m (£373m).Trump last week asked oil executives at the White House to invest $100bn in Venezuela's energy infrastructure. They said significant changes would be needed make the country an attractive investment.The blockade has sharply curtailed Venezuelan oil exports, with only ships associated with Chevron and bound for the US operating as usual, according to Matt Smith, head of US analysis at Kpler. Loadings have fallen roughly in half this month to about 400,000 barrels per day,  he said. The Veronica, a relatively small tanker with a sanctioned owner, was among about 17 ships that attempted to breach the blockade earlier this month, according to the firm.Smith said it was unclear why vessels from the so-called dark fleet would risk seizure, but noted the financial cost of delays. \"If a tanker was supposed to be moving crude and can't get through, that's money lost,\" he said.He said the US quarantine had created a bottleneck of supply that would otherwise be headed to countries, mainly China. But as the US starts selling Venezuelan oil, he said there were signs the situation was evolving with some tankers now headed to the Bahamas for storage.The latest tanker seizure came just hours ahead of a meeting between Trump and Venezuela's opposition leader Maria Corina Machado at the White House.Trump has previously described her as a \"freedom fighter\", but rejected the notion of appointing her to lead Venezuela after Maduro's removal, arguing that she lacks sufficient domestic backing. He instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.Trump describes Rodríguez as an \"ally\", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.Machado is expected to use her face time with Trump to try to persuade him that his decision to back Rodríguez's interim government is a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition.A Venezuelan government envoy, too, is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps towards reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported.\"The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of the interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, who has been described as \"extremely co-operative\" by the White House.On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the $500m energy deal was struck in large part because of help from Rodriguez. She said the interim president had also confirmed that Venezuela would be releasing political prisoners from Venezuela.\"There were five Americans who were recently released this week as well,\" Leavitt said. \"So, the president likes what he's seeing. And we'll expect that co-operation to continue.\"",

    "body": "20 hours agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterWatch: Astronauts return to Earth after medical evacuationFour astronauts evacuated from the International Space Station (ISS) have landed back on Earth after their stay in space was cut short by a month due to a \"serious\" medical issue.The crew's captain, Nasa astronaut Mike Fincke, exited the spacecraft first, smiling and wobbling slightly on his feet before lying down on a gurney, following normal procedures. Nasa's Zena Cardman, Japan's Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov followed, waving and beaming at cameras. \"It's so good to be home!\", said Cardman.It is the first time astronauts have been evacuated due to a health issue since the station was put into Earth's orbit in 1998.The team, known as Crew-11, will now receive medical checks before being flown back to land after the splash down off the coast of California.In a news conference after splash-down, Nasa administrator Jared Isaacman said the sick astronaut is \"fine right now\" and in \"good spirits\".Judging by past Nasa communications about astronauts' health, it is unlikely that the identity of the crew member or details of the health issue will be released to the public.Control of the ISS has been handed over to Russian cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and two other crew members.The astronauts arrived on the ISS on 1 August expecting to complete a standard six and a half month stay. They were due to come home in mid-February.NASAOleg Platonov, Mike Fincke, Zena Cardman and Kimiya Yui ended their ISS stay one month earlyBut last week, a scheduled spacewalk by Fincke and Cardman was called off at the last minute. Hours later, Nasa revealed a crew member had become ill. \"It's bittersweet,\" said Mr Fincke when he handed over the keys to the ISS to Kud-Sverchjov on Monday.  In a social media post, he stressed that all crew members on board were \"stable, safe, and well cared for\".Orbiting Earth at an altitude of 250 miles, the International Space Station (ISS) makes 16 orbits of our planet a day, travelling at a speed of 17,500 miles per hour. It is run by five space agencies and carries out wide-ranging scientific research about space and the effects on humans, animals and plants of living in microgravity.The ISS carries some medical equipment and astronauts are trained to deal with minor medical issues, but it does not have a doctor on board.The evacuation was a serious test of Nasa's procedures for dealing with medical issues. By all accounts, it passed, although there may be questions about how well the agency could have responded if the astronaut had suffered a medical emergency.The early departure leaves the ISS with a skeleton crew of just three astronauts - Nasa's Chris Williams and cosmonauts Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev - until another four arrive in February.\"Despite all the changes and all the difficulties, we are going to do our job onboard ISS, performing all the scientific tasks, maintenance tasks here, whatever happens,\" Kud-Sverchkov said on Monday. He then issued his first command - a group hug.NASAThe International Space Station has been continuously inhabited since the year 2000The incident is unprecedented in the history of the ISS, which has been permanently crewed for 26 years.Space missions have ended early due to health issues just twice before.In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin and his colleagues returned four months ahead of schedule from a mission to the Salyut 7 space station due to a urological issue. And in 1987, a heart arrhythmia caused Soviet cosmonaut Aleksandr Laveykin to leave the Mir space station early.As more and more humans travel into space, including for tourism and a possible occupation of the Moon or even Mars, space experts say doctors will need to travel on missions.",

    "body": "20 hours agoJon DonnisonCorrespondent, JerusalemOn the face of it, the announcement of phase two of President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza would seem like progress.But there remains a huge lack of clarity and detail about the future of the strip and the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there.Furthermore, there are many pitfalls.First, Trump's plan demands that Hamas, as well as other groups in Gaza, agree to disarm.Announcing phase two of the deal, the US Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said failure to do so would \"bring serious consequences\".But Hamas has so far adamantly refused to give up its weapons, which it sees as tools of resistance to Israel's decades-long military occupation.If it maintains that position, there are already far-right members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government who are champing at the bit to resume the war and \"finish the job\".While massively diminished militarily, US intelligence has long estimated that Hamas has likely recruited more new members in Gaza than have been killed by Israel during the war.The ceasefire, which has been in place since October last year, is already fragile at best.Both sides have accused each other of repeated violations.More than 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. The Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups during the same period.Secondly, there is little clarity over to what extent Israel will be required to withdraw its forces from Gaza.It has given no indication that it is willing to pull back completely, insisting it needs to maintain a strong security presence in Gaza.Israel officials talk of \"a new reality\" in Gaza, insisting that the strip will never go back to the way it was before Hamas launched its deadly attack on 7 October 2023.So, there could be continued wrangling over how far Israeli forces withdraw.Then there is the issue of governance.Who will run Gaza, if not Hamas, which came to power after winning Palestinian elections almost exactly 20 years ago?Who will provide policing, security, schools, hospitals?For more than a year now, there has been the idea that some sort of International Stabilization Force could provide security in Gaza.Egypt, Turkey, the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as the West Bank-based, Palestinian Authority, have all been suggested as potential countries that would make up this force.But none have committed and, again, the detail is unclear.Anyone seen as \"riding in on the back of Israeli tanks\" is likely to meet a frosty reception from Palestinians in Gaza.Under Trump's peace plan, Gaza will supposedly have three levels of governance.As the lowest level, the strip will be run by a new government of technocrats made up of figures from civil society within Gaza.The names of its members were announced on Wednesday, with Hamas having agreed to have no role in the government.Above that will be an Executive Committee based outside Gaza to oversee the new government's work.It is likely to be made up of non-Palestinians, with former British prime minister Tony Blair said be among those who will sit on the committee.Blair is widely distrusted by Palestinians, being seen as too close to Israel, and for his role, alongside former US president George W Bush, in the second Iraq War launched in 2003.Finally, above the Executive Committee will be the Board of Peace, with Trump as its chairman.The current British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are rumoured to be among the board's proposed members.Many Palestinians say having foreigners in effect running Gaza smacks of colonialism.The question is: do they have a choice?And all the while, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains utterly bleak.Since the ceasefire was announced last October, more aid has been allowed into the strip, but aid agencies say it is still nowhere near enough.Hundreds of thousands of Gazans remain homeless and are living in makeshift tents.The last few months in the region has seen grim winter weather, with torrential rain, high winds and temperatures below 5C (41F).Gaza has experienced severe flooding, with buildings collapsing and tents blown away.Most children have had little or no education for more than two years.What does the future hold for them?So, while phase two of the peace plan may seem like progress, there remain many reasons for pessimism.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLeehyun Choi,SeoulandKelly NgGetty ImagesThis verdict comes more than a year after Yoon's short-lived martial law decreeSouth Korea's beleaguered ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been found guilty of abuse of power, falsifying documents and obstructing justice when he tried and failed to impose martial law in the country in 2024. He has also been sentenced to five years in jail.Yoon is facing three other trials for charges ranging from insurrection to violating campaign law. The verdict comes more than a year after his short-lived decree threw South Korea into political turmoil, leaving it deeply divided.Here's what to know about the key charges laid against Yoon.Obstruction of justiceOn Friday, Yoon was found guilty of obstruction of justice by evading arrest; abuse of power by not convening a cabinet meeting before his martial law declaration; and falsifying official documents.Prosecutors accused him of using state institutions \"for personal purposes\" to conceal wrongdoing and undermine constitutional checks and balances.In January last year, it took some 3,000 police officers, over two attempts, to finally take Yoon into custody for questioning over the insurrection charge.Yoon had mobilised a large group of security officers who formed a human wall inside his residence to block the arrest - a move that a special prosecutor investigating the charge said was unprecedented.Yoon, meanwhile, argued the Corruption Investigation Office that attempted to arrest him lacked jurisdiction to investigate insurrection charges.The chaos surrounding the arrest, and the earlier failed attempt, \"demonstrated apparent lawlessness by Yoon, [his] conservative party, and South Korea's domestic security institutions\", said Mason Richey, an associate professor at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\"The obstruction of justice trial is a way to ensure accountability for these,\" he said.InsurrectionUnder South Korea's constitution, sitting presidents are immune from criminal persecution, except for on charges of insurrection and treason. Yoon was charged on 26 January 2025. By then, parliament had voted to impeach him, but he was not yet removed from office.Prosecutors allege that Yoon attempted to subvert the constitution by declaring martial law in the absence of war or any national emergency.In particular, he's been charged over how he mobilised troops and police to seal off the National Assembly compound to prevent lawmakers from blocking his decree, and how he ordered the arrests of the National Assembly speaker and then-leaders of the main political parties.Yoon had earlier claimed he declared martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea - but it soon became clear he was spurred by his own political troubles.Prosecutors have sought the death penalty, describing Yoon as \"unrepentant\".South Korea has not executed anyone since December 1997.AFP via Getty ImagesYoon's decree and the subsequent legal proceedings have prompted scores, both supporters and opponents, to take to the streetsFormer president Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled South Korea in the 1980s as a military dictator, was sentenced to death for leading an insurrection, though this was later reduced to life imprisonment. His ally and successor Roh Tae-woo was handed a lengthy jail term for his part in the insurrection. Both were eventually pardoned.Prosecutors have argued, however, that Yoon's 2024 martial law attempt \"tarnished the nation's dignity far more severely\" than the military coup Chun and Roh staged in 1979.\"We all saw how he disrespected the courtroom, smirking and laughing amongst his lawyers during witness testimonies. That did not help his case at all,\" said law professor Lim Ji-bong.Lim believes the judge will hand down a life sentence, though, so as to \"avoid making Yoon a martyr\". A death sentence carries political risk as it may further alienate Yoon's supporters and deepen chaos in the country, he said.US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee believes Yoon will ultimately be pardoned no matter what sentence he receives, as Chun and Roh were. \"It's a customary thing about Korean politics,\" Lee said. \"Whatever the sentence, it's a symbolic acknowledgement of how severe the crime is.\"ReutersIt took some 3,000 police officers to finally arrest Yoon in January last yearAiding an enemy stateProsecutors have also alleged that Yoon tried to provoke North Korea into attacking the South so as to justify his martial law declaration. In putting forward this charge, the prosecution relied on evidence found on former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung's phone that contained words suggesting potential provocations. They also cited a memo which appeared to push for a move to \"create an unstable situation or seize an arising opportunity\".This trial, which opened on Monday, will look at whether Yoon ordered drone flights into the North to induce military conflict between the Koreas, among other things. Yeo and Yoon's former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun have also been indicted on the same charge.Other chargesYoon has also been accused of perjury, for when he testified during former prime minister Han Duck-soo's trial last year on charges of aiding the insurrection. Prosecutors allege that Yoon falsely testified by claiming he had long planned to hold a cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Investigators said Yoon had no such plan and only convened a meeting at Han's urging.Apart from charges related to his martial law attempt, Yoon has also been indicted in a series of other cases. He is among 33 people charged for allegedly obstructing an investigation into the death of a young marine officer in 2023, and for aiding the suspect in this case.He has also been charged for meddling in the 2022 presidential elections and making false statements during his campaign.

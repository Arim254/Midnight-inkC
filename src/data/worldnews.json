    "body": "14 hours agoPaulin KolaReutersEmotions are still raw outside the barFamilies of the victims of a fire at a Swiss bar on New Year's Eve have expressed shock after officials admitted the venue had not undergone safety checks for five years.Romain Jordan, who represents some of the families, said the \"staggering number of breaches and shortcomings in the inspections raises the question of whether the municipality should be investigated with even greater urgency\".Other lawyers also urged officials to take responsibility for the disaster at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana in which 40 people died and 116 were injured. Prosecutors believe the fire started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached set light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling. The two bar managers have been placed under criminal investigation, but not in custody. French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.In their first statement since the fire, they said they were \"devastated\" and pledged \"full co-operation\" with the investigation.Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but the mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, said on Tuesday he could not explain why it hadn't been checked in so long. \"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.ReutersRicardo Minghetti, whose funeral was held on Wednesday, was one of eight victims under the age of 16More on this storyMost of the victims of the fire were young - eight under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns and are being treated in Switzerland and other European countries.The funerals of some of those who died have been taking place.Watch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor saysUnder Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities.

    "body": "A spell of freezing weather bringing heavy snowfall and ice has caused transport disruption across western Europe.Hundreds of flights have been cancelled at several airports, while Eurostar services and haulage have also been affected.More than 700 flights were cancelled at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, a major regional transport hub, on Wednesday. Meanwhile, France's civil aviation authority has asked airlines to cut 40% of flights scheduled for the main international airport in Paris.At least six people have died in weather-related incidents across Europe this week -five in France and one in Bosnia.Dutch national airline KLM warned Schiphol Airport was close to running out of de-icing fluid after days of freezing conditions.Spokesperson Stephan Donker told news agency Reuters that it was an \"exceptional situation\" at the Dutch airport, where more than 1,000 travellers spent the night.A few hundred beds have been set up there before and after security checks with food and drinks also provided, he said.Donker warned of knock-on effects from the disruption, with further delays and cancellations possible in coming days.In Paris, more than 100 flights were cancelled at Charles de Gaulle airport and 40 more at Orly.Dozens of fllights have been delayed or cancelled in and out of Heathrow and Brussels.Some Eurostar rail services between London and Paris were delayed or cancelled on Wednesday. Almost half of mainland France was on alert for heavy snow and black ice, with lorries banned from the roads in some areas.\"It's better to be here than stuck on the road,\" driver Carle Bruno told news agency AFP at a roadside service station in the northern port of Le Havre.Five people died in two separate regions of France earlier this week as a result of treacherous driving conditions, authorities said, while a woman was also killed in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, after 40cm (16in) of snow fell on the city.In Paris, Guinean teenager Boubacar Camara, sleeping in a tent on the outskirts of the city, told AFP he had \"no choice but to keep on going\".\"You just have to stay strong [and] make sure you don't die,\" the 19-year-old said. \"We can't do anything about the cold. I'm not used to this at all.\"The rare sight of the French capital covered in snow drew residents and tourists out to ski down the slopes of Montmartre and along the Champs de Mars gardens below the Eiffel Tower.\"It's exceptional, it's incredible,\" said Pierre, a Parisian. \"It's magnificent and we're enjoying it. We also came across a lot of tourists and they look so happy.\" ",

    "body": "Crowds lined the streets of Saint-Tropez for the funeral of French film legend Brigitte Bardot on Wednesday.Some of those gathered were seen applauding as her coffin was driven through the French Riviera town after a service in a local church.Among the guests at the service were far-right politician Marine le Pen and Equality Minister Aurore Bergé, who like Bardot, is a defender of animal rights. The actress was later buried at a hillside cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean.Bardot, who revolutionised 1950s French cinema and became a symbol of sexual liberation, died of cancer aged 91 three days after Christmas.Bardot had left instructions that her funeral be conducted without fanfare or ostentation - but the people of Saint-Tropez wanted to pay her a proper adieu on Wednesday.Screens were set up in the small fishing town that was transformed by Bardot's fame into a playground for the jet set.Bardot's only son Nicolas-Jacques Charrier was among those carrying the coffin to the cemetery where the actress' parents and first husband Roger Vadim are buried. After her death, French President Emmanuel Macron said the nation was mourning \"a legend of the century\", while the Brigitte Bardot Foundation remembered her as a \"world-renowned actress\". The cinema icon - \"BB\" as she was known in her home country - acted in almost 50 films, including And God Created Woman, but retired in 1973 to devote her life to animal welfare.Later in life, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.Her right-wing views alienated her from many in the political establishment.",

    "body": "5 hours agoGabriela PomeroyGetty ImagesThousands of residents fled the Ashrafieh neighbourhood of Aleppo on WednesdayAt least 12 people have reportedly been killed during two days of intense clashes between Syrian government and Kurdish fighters in the northern city of Aleppo.Tens of thousands of civilians have also fled the Kurdish majority neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh, which the Syrian army shelled on Wednesday afternoon after designating them as \"closed military areas\".The government said the operation was a response to attacks by armed groups in the areas and was \"solely aimed at preserving security\".The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance - which insists it has no military presence in Aleppo - called it a \"criminal attempt\" to forcibly displace residents.One Aleppo resident told the BBC on Wednesday that the situation was \"terrible and awful\".\"All my friends have left for other towns. Sometimes it is calm and suddenly war starts again,\" they said.A displaced man from Ashrafieh, Samer Issa, told Reuters news agency that he was sleeping in a mosque which had been turned into a shelter with his young children. \"The shelling intensified. We left because our children could no longer endure the hits and the shelling,\" he said, describing the situation as \"heartbreaking\".Getty ImagesSyrian government forces deployed near Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh The violence underscores the challenges facing the government of President Ahmad al-Sharaa in a country that remains deeply divided a year after he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad.In March 2025, the Kurdish-led SDF, which controls much of Syria's north-east and has tens of thousands of fighters, signed a deal to integrate all military and civilian institutions into the Syrian state.But that has not happened yet, with both sides accusing each other of trying to derail the agreement. The SDF remains reluctant to give up the autonomy it won during the country's 13-year civil war, when it helped US-led forces defeat the Islamic State (IS) group. The stand-off in Aleppo also risks dragging in Turkey, which backs the government and considers the Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF as a terrorist organisation.",

    "body": "An employee at Japan's nuclear safety agency lost his work phone containing sensitive information during a personal trip to China, Japanese media report.The phone contained confidential contact details of staff involved in nuclear security work at the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA). The agency could not confirm if the data was leaked, reports say.The incident comes as Japan attempts to revive its atomic energy programme, which has been stalled for more than a decade.Japan ordered all its nuclear power plant reactors to be shut down in 2011 after a magnitude 9 earthquake and massive tsunami caused a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant.The NRA was formed after the Fukushima nuclear disaster to oversee nuclear safety, including the restarting of the country's reactors.The NRA employee is believed to have lost his work phone on 3 November while undergoing a security check at a Shanghai airport on a personal trip.He noticed the phone was missing three days later and, despite checking with the airport, did not recover it.The NRA issues smartphones to certain employees so they can respond promptly to emergencies, the Asahi newspaper reported.According to Kyodo News, the affected NRA department deals with protecting nuclear materials from threats like theft and terrorism at the country's facilities.The NRA reported the incident to the country's Personal Information Protection Commission and has warned employees against bringing work phones overseas, local media reported.This is not the first time that Japan's nuclear officials have made headlines for security lapses.In 2023, an employee at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant—the world's largest nuclear facility—lost a stack of documents after placing it on top of their car and driving off.Last November, another employee at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant was found to have mishandled confidential documents by making copies of them and locking them in a desk.And this week, Chubu Electric Power, a nuclear plant operator in central Japan, said it might have used cherry-picked data during safety screenings for its nuclear plant.The NRA has since suspended its review for Chubu to restart its reactors, citing the \"fabrication of critical inspection data\", Reuters reported.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondentBBCLena's family have been cooking on a camping stovePower is being restored to the last homes hit by a five-day blackout in Germany's snow-covered capital, Berlin.The outage was caused by a suspected arson attack and came as temperatures dipped below freezing.It is reportedly the longest blackout in the capital's post-war history. A far-left militant group has claimed it was behind the outage.This week's images of residents - young and old - living through a prolonged blackout in the country's capital has reignited a debate about Germany's vulnerability to sabotage attacks, whether by domestic or foreign actors.Schools, hospitals and care homes are among the tens of thousands of properties that were affected in south-west Berlin.In Berlin's Steglitz-Zehlendorf district, on Mexikoplatz, a police van drove around announcing the imminent return of power over a tannoy.Residents regularly approached a group of emergency service workers for the latest information.Lena said her family had felt \"lost\" - relying on a battery-powered radio for updates.They have been cooking on a camping stove at home while trying to make sure their water pipes didn't freeze.Reinhold, 79, was still without power on Wednesday morning and going to his daughter's house to get warm.\"But I always came back to sleep here even in the cold weather with a bobble hat on and sweater and a woollen blanket.\"The retired architect said that he was used to hardship having been born in post-war Germany.\"I was born in 1947. When my mother and I came from the hospital... it was -20C in our shack.\"My parents took turns every hour to see whether my hands were tucked in under the cover so my fingers wouldn't freeze off.\"Reinhold has been sleeping in a woolly hat to keep warm at nightRestoring electricity was happening on a \"step-by-step basis\", said fire service spokesman Adrian Wentzel.Resources have been pulled in from across Germany, he told the BBC, with an estimated 100,000 people affected.Hospitals have had to rely on emergency generators while some schools have had to close.It was early on Saturday when several cables on a bridge were spotted burning near the Lichterfelde gas-fired power plant.Subsequently, the far-left Vulkangruppe - or Volcano Group - appeared to claim responsibility, saying its target was the fossil energy industry.\"We apologise to the less wealthy people in the south-west of Berlin,\" a lengthy statement read.\"With the many owners of villas in these districts, our sympathy is limited,\" it added, likely referring to the fact that Steglitz-Zehlendorf is one of Berlin's wealthiest neighbourhoods.However, a different statement was later published online on the Indymedia site - purportedly from Vulkangruppe's founders.\"We expressly distance ourselves from all actions of recent years,\" it said.AFP via Getty ImagesTraffic lights were cut off, tooAnother recent high-profile incident saw activists admit being behind a suspected arson attack that halted production at the huge Tesla factory just outside Berlin in 2024.The exact structure and workings of Vulkangruppe is unclear, but German authorities describe them as left-wing extremists and say attacks have happened at irregular intervals since 2011 in Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg.Domestic intelligence state that the group's aim is to disrupt \"the day-to-day functions in order to harm the hated capitalist system\".Federal prosecutors are investigating the latest incident as a terrorism offence, with possible charges including \"membership in a terrorist organisation, sabotage, arson and disruption of public services\".This week's outage was larger and lasted longer than a similar incident in September.Plans for a federal law to protect critical infrastructure have been in the works for years but were only presented to the German parliament in November.The \"Kritis\" bill sets out plans to identify key critical infrastructure transport as well as introduce minimum protection standards.",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaulin KolaReutersThe war in Ukraine is nearing its fourth anniversaryUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says European allies have not given him sound guarantees that they will protect his country in the case of a new Russian aggression.\"I am asking this very question to all our partners and I have not received a clear, unambiguous answer yet,\" he told reporters on Wednesday.His comments come a day after the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal to end the war with Russia is agreed.But full security guarantees have not been agreed. The US, which has been leading efforts to end the invasion, reportedly did not sign such a pledge at talks in Paris on Tuesday.After the Paris talks, which included some 30 countries that form the so-called Coalition of the Willing, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK and France would \"establish military hubs across Ukraine\" to deter future invasion, while French President Emmanuel Macron later said thousands of troops may be deployed.Allies proposed that the US would take the lead in monitoring a truce. But the key issue of territorial concessions that Ukraine is being asked to grant to Russia as part of the peace proposals are still being discussed.Moscow has not yet commented on the announcement made in the French capital.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.Sir Keir described the joint statement as \"a vital part of our commitment to stand with Ukraine for the long-term\".He added: \"It paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas, and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future.\"Zelensky hailed that agreement as a \"huge step forward\".A day later, however, he appeared less optimistic.\"I see the will, the political will, and that the partners are ready, and the partners are ready to give us strong sanctions, strong security guarantees,\" he said when asked if European countries would defend Ukraine.\"But as long as we don't have such security guarantees - legally binding, supported by parliaments, supported by the United States Congress - this question cannot be answered. And even if they do, you still have to rely primarily on your own strength.\"The Paris talks were also notable owing to the presence of US President Donald Trump's peace envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.Witkoff said the allies \"largely finished\" their work on agreeing security protocols.EPA/ShutterstockRussia continues to strike Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure across the country on a daily basisLast week, Zelensky said a peace deal was \"90% ready\". Territorial concessions and security guarantees have been at the forefront of unresolved issues for negotiators.Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war.Zelensky has so far ruled out ceding any territory, but has suggested that Ukraine could withdraw its troops to an agreed point - but only if Russia did the same.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial Donbas region.It has been intensifying attacks against Ukrainian cities - particularly targeting energy infrastructure. Russia has also made slow progress in capturing more Ukrainian territory.Ukraine has hit back at Russian targets with drones, albeit with more limited success.",

    "body": "A pair of twin mountain gorillas has been born in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo - a rare occurrence for the endangered primates, conservationists at Virunga National Park say.The community trackers, who discovered 22-year-old Mafuko hugging her newborns on Saturday, said the mother and her two baby sons all appeared to be well and healthy. Twin births are thought to account for about 1% of all mountain gorilla births, though exact data is not widely available.Virunga, situated in a conflict-prone part of DR Congo, is Africa's oldest and largest national park and was set up 100 years ago to protect mountain gorillas of which there are fewer than 1,100 left in the wild.They are only found in the Virunga and in national parks over the border in Rwanda and Uganda, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which compiles a Red List of threatened species.The last birth of mountain gorilla twins in Virunga National Park was in September 2020.Mafuko herself gave birth to twins in 2016, but they both died within a week.Young gorillas rely entirely on their mothers for care and transport - and are extremely vulnerable in what can be a dangerous environment where poachers and many armed groups operate.The authorities at the park say additional monitoring and protection measures have been put in place to ensure the twins' survival during this critical period. Rangers would closely observe the young family and provide support if needed, they said.A gorilla's pregnancy lasts for about eight-and-a-half months, and females usually give birth to one infant every four years. According to Virunga conservationists, Mafuko has had a remarkable history of survival herself.Born in 2003 into the Kabirizi family, she lost her mother to armed attackers when she was four years old. She joined the Bageni family when she was 10 - and to date has been pregnant and given birth five times.Conservationists at Virunga, which is a Unesco World Heritage Site, say her latest offspring represent a significant boost for efforts to protect the endangered species.Thanks to anti-poaching patrols and community programmes - supported by the European Union and Unesco - mountain gorilla numbers in Virunga have slowly increased over the past decade.This success, which is documented by the IUCN and other partners, led to their status being upgraded from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" in 2018.Virunga spans 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) and is home to an astonishingly diverse landscape - from active volcanoes and vast lakes to rainforest and mountains.",

    "body": "6 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,JerusalemandDavid GrittenReutersThe UN report says Palestinians in the West Bank face \"systemic discrimination\" by Israeli authoritiesThe UN human rights office has issued a report detailing what it calls Israel's \"systemic discrimination\" against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and said the situation has \"drastically deteriorated\" over the past three years.Israeli laws, policies and practices were having an \"asphyxiating impact\" on every aspect of daily life for Palestinians and violated an international convention against racial discrimination, it said.\"This is a particularly severe form of racial discrimination and segregation that resembles the kind of apartheid system we have seen before,\" High Commissioner Volker Türk warned.Israel dismissed the accusations as \"absurd and distorted\".The Israeli mission in Geneva said the UN human rights office \"completely ignores fundamental facts that lie at the basis of the [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict, and that inform the actions and policies of the State of Israel, mainly the grave security threats Israel faces, which were put on display on October 7 2023\".It also accused the office of abusing its position \"to issue yet another unmandated report\" and having an \"inherently politically driven fixation... on vilifying Israel\".Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law.This is the first time a UN human rights chief has explicitly compared Israeli policies in the West Bank to apartheid - the policy of racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced by the white minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority from 1948 until 1991.\"Whether accessing water, school, rushing to hospital, visiting family or friends, or harvesting olives - every aspect of life for Palestinians in the West Bank is controlled and curtailed by Israel's discriminatory laws, policies and practices\" Türk said in a statement.According to the 42-page report by his office, Israeli authorities treat Israeli settlers and Palestinians living in the West Bank under two distinct bodies of law and policies, which it says results in unequal treatment on a range of critical issues.\"Palestinians continue to be subjected to large-scale confiscation of land and deprivation of access to resources. This has had the effect of dispossessing them of their lands and homes, alongside other forms of systemic discrimination, including criminal prosecution in military courts during which their due process and fair trial rights are systematically violated,\" it finds.EPAIsrael's government last month approved plans to rebuild the previously evacuated settlement of Sa-NurThe report says there are \"reasonable grounds to believe that this separation, segregation, and subordination is intended to be permanent, indicating that these laws, policies, and practices amount to a deliberate policy of physical and juridical separation intended to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank\".It adds that this amounts to a violation of Israel's obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) to prevent racial segregation and apartheid in territories under its jurisdiction.The reports says systemic discrimination against Palestinians has been \"a long-standing concern\" for the UN but that it has \"drastically deteriorated\" since at least December 2022 and especially since the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which sparked the Gaza war.It also says that Israel's settlement expansion in the West Bank had intensified over the past two years, citing the approval last month of the construction of 19 new settlements, which Israeli ministers said was about blocking the establishment of a Palestinian state.\"Every negative trend documented in the report has not only continued but accelerated. And every day this is allowed to continue, the consequences worsen for Palestinians,\" Türk warned.",

    "body": "A plot to kill Burkina Faso's military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, has been thwarted, the West African nation has announced.The sophisticated plan had been hatched by Lt Col Paul Henri Damiba, the military officer ousted by Traoré in September 2022, the security minister said in a late-night broadcast.\"Our intelligence services intercepted this operation in the final hours. They had planned to assassinate the head of state and then strike other key institutions, including civilian personalities,\" said Mahamadou Sana, further alleging that the plot had been funded by neighbouring Ivory Coast.There has been no comment from either Col Damiba or Ivory Coast.Since seizing power, Capt Traoré has faced at least two coup attempts and is also grappling with growing jihadist violence that has forced millions from their homes.Despite these challenges and his authoritarian reputation, the 37-year-old military leader maintains strong popular support and has gained a following across the continent for his pan-Africanist vision and criticism of Western influence.Authorities uncovered a leaked video showing the plotters discussing their plans, according to the security minister.In the footage, they allegedly spoke about how they intended to assassinate the president - either at close range or by planting explosives at his residence - just after 23:00 local time on Saturday 3 January.Afterwards, they allegedly planned to target other senior military and civilian figures.Sana alleged that Damiba had mobilised both soldiers and civilian supporters, secured foreign funding - most significantly 70m CFA francs ($125,000; £92,000)  delivered from Ivory Coast - and planned to knock out the country's drone-launch base before foreign forces could intervene.\"We are carrying out ongoing investigations and have made several arrests. These individuals will be brought to justice soon,\" the minister said on national television.Sana insisted the situation was under control and urged citizens \"not to be misled, out of naivety, into dangerous schemes\".It is unclear how many people have been arrested.Critics, both local and foreign, have accused Capt Traoré of authoritarianism and say his government suppresses dissent - including arbitrary arrests of military officers and restrictions on the media.It is not the first time the junta has pointed the finger of blame about foreign interference in its affairs at Ivory Coast.These continuing internal power struggles will further heighten regional tensions.Col Damiba served as Burkina Faso's leader from January-September 2022 after seizing power from an elected government.After being ousted, he went into exile in neighbouring Togo and said in a message published on social media that he wished his successor every success.",

    "body": "11 hours agoChukwunaeme Obiejesi,BBC PidginandMansur Abubakar,both in AbujaA Nigerian court has granted bail to the country's former attorney general, Abubakar Malami, along with his wife and son, who are facing money laundering charges.Malami, 58, was one of the most influential figures in the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari between 2015 and 2023.He was charged last month with 16 counts of money laundering and abuse of office worth a total of 8.7bn naira ($6m; £4.5m), and has been held in prison since 30 December.In court, he pleaded not guilty to all charges. He previously described his arrest as politically motivated.The lawyer, who is married to Buhari‘s third child, Nana Hadiza, recently left the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to join the opposition African Democratic Congress, which is viewed as the biggest rival to the APC in the 2027 general elections.Malami is one of several ministers in the Buhari administration accused of corruption, including another influential figure, Hadi Sirika, who was in charge of the country’s aviation ministry.In court on Wednesday, presiding judge Emeka Nwite stated that the charges against the defendants were bailable offences.He said they could be released on bail set at 500m naira (£260,000; $350,000) each. They must also provide two guarantors who own property in designated parts of the capital, Abuja, and surrender their travel documents to the court.The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alleges that the former minister used his office to divert government funds, which were then used to acquire properties in several Nigerian cities, including Abuja.The EFCC recently released a list of high-value properties allegedly linked to Malami, including hotels, residential buildings, schools, factories, parcels of land and a printing press. The properties are spread across Abuja, as well as Kebbi and Kano states.The scale of the properties he allegedly owned sparked a national debate about the wealth of Nigeria's politicians when the list was released.Political analyst Idris Adamu told the BBC the case had taken him by surprise given the minister's previous perceived invulnerability.\"Seeing the video of Malami being ushered into the vehicle that would take him to Kuje prison last month felt surreal,\" Adamu said. \"This was a man that wielded so much power and influence under Buhari.\"He added that the high-profile prosecution signalled that \"no-one is above the law, even if you are the former justice minister of a country\".The case has been adjourned until 17 February 2025.",

    "description": "US President Donald Trump and his officials are \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy the Danish territory of Greenland, the White House has ",
    "body": "US President Donald Trump and his officials are \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy the Danish territory of Greenland, the White House has confirmed.It is \"something that's currently being actively discussed by the president and his national security team\", White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island was not for sale.Asked why the Trump administration had previously said it was not ruling out using military force to acquire Greenland, Leavitt replied that all options were always on the table but Trump's \"first option always has been diplomacy\".Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's unilateral use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Denmark, a fellow Nato ally, says an attack on its territory would end the military alliance. The Trump administration says Greenland is vital to US security. Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US since World War 2.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron that are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he will hold talks with Denmark next week.Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.\"The acquisition of Greenland by the United States is not a new idea,\" Leavitt said.\"The president has been very open and clear with all of you and with the world, that he views it in the best interest of the United States to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region, and so that's why his team is currently talking about what a potential purchase would look like.\"The White House said earlier this week that Trump had been discussing a range of options to acquire Greenland, including using military force.\"All options are always on the table for President Trump as he examines what's in the best interests of the United States,\" Leavitt said.Earlier in the day, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Rubio had \"ruled out the possibility of an invasion\" of Greenland in a phone call with him.Barrot is due to discuss the Arctic island with his German and Polish counterparts later on Wednesday.On Tuesday, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark.\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement.Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".A day after the US military action in Venezuela, Katie Miller, the wife of one of Trump's senior aides, posted a map on social media of Greenland in the colours of the US flag, alongside the word \"SOON\".On Monday, her husband, Stephen Miller, said it was \"the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US\".Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were \"a clear threat\".\"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she said.But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely - instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\".Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership.\"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he told the BBC. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\"Saying that he did not have \"time for Trump\", he added that people were \"in need\". Hunters like him, he explained, hunted with dogs on the sea ice and fish \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen",

    "body": "2 hours agoGabriela Pomeroy,Alicia CurryandAdrienne Murray,in CopenhagenMia ChemnitzMia Chemnitz says \"the people of Greenland do not want to become American\"\"The people of Greenland do not want to become American,\" Mia Chemnitz tells the BBC. \"We are not for sale.\"The 32-year-old business owner in the Greenlandic capital Nuuk reflects the sentiments of many who spoke to the BBC about how they felt about recent rhetoric from the Trump administration.The White House has said it was \"actively\" discussing an offer to buy the territory that has for centuries belonged to Denmark. US President Donald Trump and his officials had earlier intimated a willingness to take it by force if necessary.This has been met with nervousness and opprobrium among Greenlanders - both on the world's largest island and elsewhere.This nervousness has only grown since the US took Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro from his residence in Caracas to New York on drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in an unprecedented military move.Almost immediately after, the wife of a senior White House staffer indicated that Greenland was next.\"That's when it stopped feeling abstract,\" says Tupaarnaq Kopeck, 40, who moved to Canada - another place Trump has threatened to annex - for family and work.\"For the first time, I contacted my sister in Greenland and told her that if the unthinkable ever became reality, they would have a place to stay with us.\"Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, says the comments from the Trump administration are \"a clear threat\" that she was \"appalled\" by.\"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she says.Tupaarnaq KopeckTupaarnaq Kopeck says the military intervention in Venezuela made the abstract feel realGreenland is the world's most sparsely populated territory. With much of the Arctic island covered by ice, most of the population lives in Nuuk and the surrounding south-western coastline.But it is strategically significant to the US - which is why it has had a military presence there since World War 2. Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks.More recently, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change.\"It's not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats - if you can call them that - from a giant like the US,\" says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\"The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.\"Experts generally agree that a military takeover of Greenland would be an easy undertaking for the US - but that the geopolitical fallout would effectively end the Nato alliance.After the issue of Greenland's ownership was raised anew by the White House, six European allies issued a statement saying its future should be decided by its people - something Mia says she is grateful for.But she worries this will matter little to the US \"if it's not backed with consequences and actions\".\"As a Greenlander, I can't help but wonder: what are we worth to these allies? To what lengths are they willing to go to protect us?\"Tupaarnaq says: \"Respect is about more than alliances on paper. When powerful nations talk about you instead of with you, that respect disappears very quickly.\"Aleqatsiaq PearyAleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter says a US takeover would just \"replace one occupier with another\"The Trump administration has stressed its intention was to buy Greenland from Denmark - despite Copenhagen reiterating the territory was not for sale - while retaining a military intervention as an option.Aaja sees annexation by force as unlikely - instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\".Polling consistently shows that Greenlanders generally favour eventual independence from Denmark but oppose being owned by the US. The territory is largely self-governing, with control of foreign affairs and defence retained by Copenhagen.This is perhaps why Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in the remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, seemed unfazed by the prospect of US ownership.\"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he says. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\"But he says: \"I don't have time for Trump. Our people are in need,\" explaining hunters like him hunt with dogs on the sea ice and fish, \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".For Sermitsiaq editor Masaana, the rhetoric from the US is pushing a fallacious binary choice.\"We really have to try to avoid getting the story going to a place where it's Greenland that has to decide between the US and Denmark, because that is not the choice that the Greenlandic people want.\"Christian KeldsenChristian Keldsen says \"people in Greenland are getting really irritated with this\"For others, who see the strong relationship Greenland already has with the US being soured, there is a clear sense of indignation.\"People in Greenland are getting really irritated with this,\" says Christian Keldsen of the Greenland Business Association.\"Greenlanders are welcoming and open-hearted, it's the best thing about the country. But now with this, some people are scared.\"Greenland is open for business with the US, Christian stresses, noting that there are new direct flights from Greenland to New York - a sure sign \"they don't need to take us over\".\"We are a well-functioning democracy and our government has a strong mandate,\" Mia says. \"We are a Nato ally and the US has had military bases in Greenland for over 70 years - and still has the right to establish and run new and more.\"As it has been stated from Greenland before: we are not for sale, but we're open for business.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoSimon FraserAsia editor, BBC News websitePrince Group/Getty imagesCambodia says it has extradited to China a billionaire businessman accused of  masterminding a vast cryptocurrency scam in which trafficked workers were lured to forced labour camps to defraud victims globally.Chen Zhi was among three Chinese nationals arrested on 6 January after a joint investigation into transnational crime lasting several months, Cambodia said.The US charged the 37-year-old, who was born in south-east China, last October with running internet scams from Cambodia that it said had stolen billions in cryptocurrency.The US Treasury Department seized about $14bn (£10.4bn) worth of bitcoin it alleged belonged to him. The UK also sanctioned his global business empire, Prince Group.US prosecutors said it was one the biggest financial takedowns in history and the largest ever seizure of bitcoin.The BBC contacted Prince Group for comment at the time. In the past, the Cambodia-based group has denied any involvement in scams. Its website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services.Since Chen Zhi was indicted by the US on fraud and money-laundering charges in October, his whereabouts have been unclear.But on Wednesday, the Cambodian authorities said they had \"arrested three Chinese nationals namely Chen Zhi, Xu Ji Liang, and Shao Ji Hui and extradited [them] to the People's Republic of China\". The interior ministry statement did not say where Chen Zhi had been detained.His Cambodian nationality had been revoked by royal decree last month, it added. The enigmatic tycoon had given up his Chinese nationality to become a Cambodian citizen in 2014.The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to South East Asia, many of them to Cambodia, lured by the promise of legitimate jobs and then forced to run online scams.People are held against their will in the scam farms and made to defraud strangers online under the threat of punishment or torture. Many of those trapped are Chinese and targeted people in China.EPAScam centres have proliferated in South East Asia - above, people rescued from compounds in Myanmar last February are seen arriving in Thailand Chinese authorities have also been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020. The company is accused of running online fraud schemes in a number of court cases.The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau established a task force to investigate the Prince Group, describing it as \"a major transnational online gambling syndicate based in Cambodia\".AFP via Getty ImagesUS authorities accuse Chen Zhi of turning Prince Group into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organisationsCambodia's ruling elite have been close to Chen Zhi for years. The government has said little since the US and UK sanctioned Prince Group, apart from urging US and UK authorities to be sure they had sufficient evidence for their allegations.By some estimates, scam businesses may account for around half of the entire Cambodian economy.\"I think it's the sheer scale of his operations which really makes Chen Zhi stand out,\" Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who has investigated Chen Zhi, told the BBC last year.He said it was shocking the Prince Group had been able to build a \"global footprint\" without raising alarm bells, given the serious criminal charges it now faces.Additional reporting by South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head",

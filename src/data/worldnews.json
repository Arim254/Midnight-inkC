    "body": "7 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesPeru's Congress has ousted interim President José Jerí just four months after he took office for failing to disclose meetings with Chinese businessmen.The scandal unfolded last month after videos emerged of Jerí meeting several times outside his official schedule with businessman Zhihua Yang, who was under government scrutiny.Jerí had previously apologised for the meetings, but denied any wrongdoing and accused his rivals of a public smear campaign.His removal from office makes him the third consecutive president to be ousted, after he replaced former leader Dina Boluarte, who was impeached in October last year.Jerí was Peru's seventh president since 2016 amid a tumultuous political landscape that has seen a succession of leaders leave the post under contentious circumstances.While lawmakers had set a date to discuss impeaching Jerí, in the end they opted for a different parliamentary procedure called censure, which only required a simple majority to pass rather than the super majority needed for an impeachment.Later on Wednesday, Congress will name a new interim president who will serve only for a few months - until a new president is chosen by the people in a general election this April. Jerí had come under fire following a series of controversies dubbed \"Chifa-gate\" - after a local name for Chinese-Peruvian fusion food and the restaurants which serve it.Security camera footage of Jerí's meetings with Yang, who owns several businesses and was granted a state concession for an energy project, was first reported by local media.In one of the videos, Jerí could be seen wearing a hooded top during a late-night visit at one of Yang's restaurants.Also present at one of the meetings was another Chinese citizen who was under house arrest while being investigated for alleged links to an illegal timber network.Peruvian law requires presidents to document all their official activities, but Jerí did not record those meetings.Jerí faced further criticism after it emerged that state contracts had been awarded  to a number of women following late-night meetings they had with him in the presidential palace.Ruth Luque, one of the lawmakers who backed the censure measure, said she wanted a leader who would put public interest and security first.\"We ask to end this agony so we can truly create the transition citizens are hoping for,\" she said, according to Reuters news agency. \"Not a transition with hidden interests, influence-peddling, secret meetings and hooded figures. We don't want that sort of transition.\"Pressure had been mounting for Jerí to resign in the wake of the scandals as he faced a corruption investigation launched by the attorney general and his approval ratings plummeted.His removal marks another chapter of instability for Peru, which is due to hold a general election in April, after which power will be transferred to a new president.Less than a week after Jerí assumed power, protests organised by young Peruvians demanding the political class to do more to combat crime and corruption left one dead and more than 100 people injured.Correction 18 February: An earlier version of this article said José Jerí had been impeached as Peru's president. This was later updated to say he had been ousted by Congress to better reflect the parliamentary procedure used to remove him from office.",

    "body": "20 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisAFP via Getty ImagesNine people have been arrested in France following an investigation into the murder of a far-right nationalist student by suspected militants from the far-left.Those detained include a parliamentary assistant for a deputy from the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) party.Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old maths student, died in hospital on Saturday - two days after being beaten and kicked about the head by a gang of masked young men in Lyon.It happened after a small demonstration by far-right feminists - who Deranque was supposed to be helping protect - at the city's Institute of Political Studies (IEP), commonly known as Sciences-Po. The arrests confirm what has widely been reported: that those suspected of the murder are far-left militants linked to a banned group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard). The most striking news is that among the nine in custody is Jacques-Elie Favrot, a young man who until now has been employed as parliamentary assistant at the National Assembly in Paris for a deputy from LFI.The murder is putting huge pressure on LFI, on its 70 MPs, and on its veteran leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is a likely contender in next year's presidential election.On Sunday, Mélenchon said his party had \"nothing to do with this story. Those who accuse us are committing a libel.\"We express our consternation, but also our empathy and compassion for [Deranque's] family and friends. We have said dozens of times that we oppose all forms of violence,\" he said.On Monday, state prosecutor Thierry Dran told a news conference that Deranque was kicked and punched by \"at least six\" individuals, and that the post-mortem examination showed fatal damage to his skull and brain.",

    "body": "13 hours agoJoel GuintoGetty ImagesSara Duterte has feuded spectacularly with President Bongbong MarcosPhilippine Vice-President Sara Duterte has declared her candidacy for president in the 2028 elections.The 47-year-old's announcement comes as she is embroiled in a bitter power struggle with current President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.While the presidential vote is two years away, contenders in the Philippines' largely personality-based elections are known to prepare for years in advance.Marcos is ineligible for re-election and his allies have yet to field a challenger to Duterte - who is also the daughter of his predecessor, former president Rodrigo Duterte.\"I offer my life, my strength, and my future in the service of our nation,\" the vice-president said.\"I am Sara Duterte. I will run for president of the Philippines.\"Marcos and Duterte ran under the same ticket in the 2022 election, which they won by a landslide. But the alliance soon unravelled as they pursued separate political interests.Two months later, a mid-term legislative vote, seen as a barometer of support for the incumbent government, delivered a victory for candidates endorsed by the Duterte family, against those handpicked by Marcos.Just over a week ago, members of the Catholic clergy filed an impeachment complaint against the vice-president over alleged corruption, which she denies.Who is Sara Duterte?Sara is Rodrigo Duterte's eldest daughter and is widely-considered as his political heir.The elder Duterte once described his daughter as the \"alpha\" in their family, the one whom everyone follows.Sara served as vice-mayor to her father when he led Davao city in the 2010s. It was in that southern metropolis that the Duterte's built their reputation for being tough on crime, which they have described as necessary to keep people safe and encourage businesses to grow.Sara was thrust into the national spotlight when, in defence of shanty town dwellers, she punched a Davao sheriff in full view of TV news cameras.She was Davao city mayor when her father was president from 2016 and 2022, and her alliance with Marcos in the 2022 elections was pivotal for both their election victories.The vice-president, like her father, projects a tough image. She rides large motorcycles and has given her children nicknames like Sharky, Stonefish and Stingray. She also shares matching tattoos with her two brothers.",

    "body": "22 hours agoWatch: Jesse Jackson's life in civil rights, diplomacy, and politicsUS civil rights leader Jesse Jackson died aged 84 on Tuesday morning surrounded by relatives, according to a statement released by his family. \"It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Civil Rights leader and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Honorable Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr,\" the family said, adding that he died \"peacefully\".  The cause of his death has not been released, but Jackson had been diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and was in hospital late last year.Tributes poured in for the prominent activist, who twice ran to be the Democratic presidential nominee, including from the first black US president, Barack Obama.Jackson is survived by his wife Jacqueline and their children: Santita, Jesse Jr, Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline and Ashley.Jackson's family said in their statement that his \"unwavering commitment to justice, equality and human rights helped shape a global movement for freedom and dignity\". \"A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless from his presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilising millions to register to vote - leaving an indelible mark on history,\" they added.Alongside working with Martin Luther King Jr and running for president in 1984 and 1988, Jackson is remembered as the founder of a non-profit organisation focused on social justice and civil rights, the Rainbow PUSH coalition.Calling Jackson a \"true giant\", Obama said in a statement that Jackson's \"two historic runs for president\" had \"laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land\". Obama added that his wife Michelle \"got her first glimpse of political organising at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager\".\"For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history,\" the Obamas also said.\"From organising boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect.\"Jackson was admitted to hospital last November, and doctors said he had been diagnosed with a rare degenerative condition called PSP in April 2025, revising an earlier diagnosis of Parkinson's disease that Jackson had said was made in 2015.Both diseases affect the brain, nervous system and muscle control. Many people with PSP are initially diagnosed with Parkinson's because a number of the symptoms overlap,  according to the American Parkinson Disease Association and the group CurePSP.Born in 1941 in Greenville, South Carolina, Jackson became involved in politics at an early age. He rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leader in Martin Luther King Jr's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was with King when he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee in 1968.Over the course of his career, Jackson built a movement to bring America's increasingly diverse population together, with a message that centred on poor and working-class Americans.After his presidential runs, Jackson later positioned himself as an elder statesman within the Democratic Party.His son Jesse Jackson Jr is a former US congressman.Getty ImagesJackson was remembered by politicians and friends as an agent of change and a transformative leaderShortly after his death was announced, politicians and other public figures took to social media to mourn the loss of Jackson. US President Donald Trump said he knew Jackson \"long before becoming president\". \"He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and 'street smarts,'\" Trump said. \"He was very gregarious - Someone who truly loved people!\"Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, a former secretary of state, also shared tributes, saying they were friends with Jackson for \"almost 50 years\".\"Reverend Jackson championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives,\" they said. House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote on X that Jackson \"was a legendary voice for the voiceless\".The Democrat added: \"For decades, while labouring in the vineyards of the community, he inspired us to keep hope alive in the struggle for liberty and justice for all.\"New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the civil rights leader \"never stopped demanding that America live up to its promise\".\"He marched, he ran, he organised and he preached justice without apology,\" Mamdani said. King's daughter Bernice said Jackson had \"devoted his life to lifting people in poverty, the marginalised, and those pushed to society's edges\". Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, who worked closely with Jackson during the civil rights movement, said Jackson was a \"consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world\". \"He told us we were somebody and made us believe. I will always cherish him taking me under his wing, and I will forever try to do my part to keep hope alive,\" Sharpton said. Watch: BBC interviews Jesse Jackson in Birmingham in 2013",

    "body": "6 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykUS Department of Justice/PAEpstein took dozens more flights to the UK than were previously knownEssex Police has said it is assessing information about private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the Epstein files.The BBC understands that while the police is \"assessing\" the information, it would not necessarily lead to a full investigation.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police \"urgently\" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein's victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.An Essex Police spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\"In December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale\" investigation into his activities in the UK.The former PM wrote to the chief police constables and commissioner of the Met, Essex and Thames Valley Police.He added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".Stansted Airport said in a statement: \"All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent Fixed Base Operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.\"The airport said that these terminals are \"entirely independent\" and that \"no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal\". Immigration and customs checks for passengers arriving via private jets are carried out \"directly by Border Force\", it said, adding that it does not \"manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft\".BBC News has again contacted police forces in areas where Epstein-linked flights landed or took off from, including Police Scotland, Merseyside, Belfast, West Midlands, and Bedfordshire.Our investigations team is sifting through the latest Epstein documents released by the US Department of Justice to see what other flights and trains Epstein may have used to travel in the UK.The Essex Police statement comes as a new national group has been set up to support UK forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has said.The force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK's trade envoy.Elsewhere, Norfolk Constabulary said it was \"reviewing documents\" released in the US to \"ensure that all relevant information has been properly assessed\".A spokesperson said the force had \"not received any allegations and is not currently conducting any investigation\", but that it was \"reviewing documents\" released in the US to \"ensure that all relevant information has been properly assessed\".Last year, a BBC News investigation found one arrival and departure of an Epstein-linked flight at RAF Marham in west Norfolk.Separately, the tranche of documents released in December included a photograph taken the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk of Andrew lying across the laps of women, with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell standing in the background.The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.He was dismissed from his role as ambassador in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "19 minutes agoRobert GreenallGetty ImagesSpanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.He was detained while staying at a Madrid hotel, where he is accused of having racked up more than €20,000 of losses during several stays.Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system, and was the first of its kind to be detected.Their investigation began after suspicious activity was reported by a travel booking site. It took just four days to complete - the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyber attack, getting the system to authorise his transaction after entering only one cent as the charged amount.Police said that the transaction had at first appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount - €0.01 - to the hotel company.Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His latest stay there was for four nights, normally costing €4,000. They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.The police statement appears to suggest that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were given.ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.",

    "body": "6 hours agoCherylann MollanMumbaiGetty ImagesOnline users identified the machine as the Go2 model made by Chinese firm Unitree RoboticsAn Indian university has courted controversy at the AI summit in Delhi after an official claimed that a Chinese-made robotic dog was its own invention.The incident came to light after a professor from Galgotias University told state-run broadcaster DD News that the robot named \"Orion\" was \"developed\" at their Centre of Excellence. A video of her remarks went viral. Online users later identified the machine as the Go2 model made by Chinese firm Unitree Robotics, which is commercially available starting at about 200,000 rupees ($2,200; £1,600).In a statement on Wednesday, the university denied claiming it had built the robot and described the backlash as a \"propaganda campaign\".\"We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn AI programming and develop and deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is need of the hour,\" the university said.Neha Singh, the professor seen in the video, later told reporters her remarks had been misunderstood. \"It might be that I could not convey well what I wanted to say, or you could not understand well what I wanted to say,\" she said.Social media users, however, accused the university of dishonesty. Reports said that following the backlash, the university was asked to vacate its stall at the summit. Faculty members said they had received no official communication to do so.But hours later, news agency Press Trust of India reported that electricity supply to the stall was cut off following the controversy.A BBC reporter at the summit said the lights were turned off at the booth and no staff from the university were around.The incident is being seen as an embarrassment for the organisers of the summit as the video had also been shared on IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw's official X account. The post has since been deleted.India's IT Secretary S Krishnan said the controversy should not \"overshadow\" the work put in by other participants at the summit.\"What happened should not affect the way people present or exhibit their work at such events. The idea is not to use an opportunity like this to become something else or create unnecessary noise.\"It is essential that a proper code of conduct is followed. There are other countries and other participants involved as well,\" he told reporters.The India AI Impact Summit, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Bharat Mandapam on Monday, is being pitched by the government as a flagship gathering to position India as a global AI hub. Delegates from more than 100 countries, including several heads of governments, are attending, alongside industry leaders such as Sundar Pichai of Google.The five-day summit features policy discussions, startup showcases and closed-door meetings on AI governance, infrastructure and innovation. However, its opening day was overshadowed by complaints of overcrowding, long queues and confusion at the venue, prompting organisers to extend exhibition hours and tighten entry management. They say arrangements have since improved.BBC correspondent Vikas Pandey, who is at the summit, said the venue was \"absolutely buzzing\" on the third day, with thousands of people from different parts of India visiting stalls and soaking up the excitement. Officials say they hope the event and the conversations around it will help adoption of AI across the country.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAFPA feminist anti-immigration group said Quentin Deranque had been helping to protect its members in LyonTwo more people have been detained by French authorities investigating the killing of a far-right student activist by suspected radical left militants in Lyon, bringing the total in custody to 11.Quentin Deranque, 23, suffered a fatal brain injury when he was beaten and kicked during a demonstration last week on the sidelines of a conference held by Rima Hassan, a member of the European Parliament for hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI).The wave of arrests began on Wednesday, and included a parliamentary assistant to LFI politician Raphaël Arnault.Arnault said his assistant, Jacques-Elie Favrot, had halted all his work in parliament and his contract was being terminated.Even before his arrest, Favrot's lawyer said he formally denied responsibility for the activist's death and was unable to continue his duties because of death threats.Although the radical left party leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has sought to distance the party from Deranque's violent death, LFI has come under attack from rivals across the political spectrum, less than a month before France votes in key municipal elections.The political climate is febrile ahead of the vote - seen as the last test of public opinion before next year's presidential elections. Within the past month Sébastien Lecornu's minority government had to survive two no-confidence motions to push through this year's budget.LFI party co-ordinator Manuel Bompard announced on Wednesday that the party's Paris HQ was briefly evacuated because of a bomb threat, and went on to accuse a large cross-section of the political and media classes of making days of false and defamatory statements.\"I call for an end to this absolutely despicable exploitation of the tragedy that took place last Thursday evening in Lyon, for which France Unbowed bears absolutely no responsibility,\" he told reporters. \"This climate should worry everybody.\"AFPThe attack last Thursday took place a short distance from Sciences Po university in LyonVideos captured from the scene show three people lying on the ground coming under attack from a larger group, all of them wearing hoods.A feminist anti-immigration group called Némésis said Deranque had been outside the venue to protect its members. Némésis has blamed Young Guard for the attack - an allegation it denies. Government spokesperson Maud Bregeon has urged the party to suspend Arnault from its parliamentary group because of the MP's links to Anti-Fascist Young Guard, which has been blamed for the violence a short distance from  Sciences Po University in Lyon.A minute's silence was held in the National Assembly on Tuesday for the young activist, and politicians lined up to criticise the radical-left leader and his colleagues.Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally said Mélenchon had \"moral and political responsibility\" for what had happened and even former LFI MP Alexis Corbière called on the party to take stock politically of what had happened.Sébastien Lecornu said that \"without undermining the presumption of innocence\" LFI had to \"clean up\" its statements, ideas and its ranks fast.Mélenchon hit back, saying he refused to take lessons from Lecornu.However, more moderate figures on the left such as Socialist ex-President François Hollande have accused LFI of being responsible for lowering the tone of politics in France.\"It's clear there can be no alliance in the municipal elections between the Socialists or reformist left-wing parties and LFI in the second round,\" Hollande said on Wednesday. \"The relationship is over.\"For months the party had indulged in a kind of \"brutalisation\" of debate so there was no political space between the far left and far right, said Hollande.The actions of police have also come in for criticism, as local forces were warned that Rima Hassan's event was due to take place but riot police were not on the scene at the time of the fatal attack.",

    "body": "10 hours agoKelly NgGetty ImagesAustralia has barred a citizen linked to the Islamic State (IS) group from the country for up to two years.The person is among the group of 34 Australian women and children who tried to head home after being released from a Syrian camp earlier this week, only to be turned back by Syrian authorities for \"technical reasons\".The ban was issued \"on advice from security agencies\", Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday, adding that the other 33 people do not meet \"required legal thresholds\" to be banned.Canberra has refused to repatriate the group, believed to be made up of the wives, widows and children of IS fighters. There are 23 children among them.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stressed that these families will not receive government support to come back to the country.\"You make your bed, you lie in it,\" he told a press conference on Wednesday.\"These are people who chose to go overseas to align themselves with... a brutal, reactionary ideology that seeks to undermine and destroy our way of life.\"However legal experts have warned the government has an obligation to allow citizens the right of return, and, responding to reports the group had valid Australian passports, Albanese said his government would not \"breach Australian law\".This group in the al-Roj camp in northern Syria is among dozens of Australians who have been held in camps and prisons across the country since 2019, when IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria.Opposition politicians have raised security concerns about the possibility of these Australians' return. \"How can only one member of this group be deemed a risk and the rest somehow okay?\" Liberal Party Senator Jonno Duniam said on Tuesday, offering to help amend laws to bar more of the group.The al-Roj camp is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities, mainly women and children. Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.Speaking to ABC, the camp's director Hakmiyeh Ibrahim made an appeal to all countries that have citizens held in limbo there: \"Take your citizens, take these children and women\".The children especially are growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp, she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"Several of these camps have made headlines as the women and children living in them are severely malnourished and lack access to basic resources.Several other foreign governments - including France, the Netherlands, and the UK - have also refused to repatriate most of their citizens still held in Syria.",

    "body": "1 day agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesThe oil tanker, named Grinch, under the watch of the French navy near MarseilleFrance says it has released an oil tanker suspected of being part of Russia's sanctions-busting \"shadow fleet\" after its owner paid a fine.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the vessel, Grinch, was \"leaving French waters\" on Tuesday having paid a penalty of \"several million euros\".The tanker was seized by French forces in the Mediterranean in January and then diverted to the port city of Marseille. It had set sail from Murmansk in northern Russia and was flying under a Comoros flag, officials said.Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by using aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance.Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian oil after it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\"Circumventing European sanctions comes at a price. Russia will no longer be able to finance its war with impunity through a ghost fleet off our coasts,\" Barrot said in a post on X.He added: \"The tanker Grinch will leave French waters after shelling out several million euros and three weeks of costly immobilisation at Fos-sur-Mer. Let's keep it up.\"\"As part of a guilty plea procedure the company that owns the vessel was sentenced by the Marseille judicial court to a financial penalty of confiscation,\" the public prosecutor's office and regional maritime authorities said in a statement.The exact amount the vessel's owner was fined was unclear.While estimates vary, data from the monitoring group TankerTrackers.com suggests the fleet currently consists of 1,468 vessels, roughly triple its size at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago.The vessels tend to be old and are often poorly maintained. Details of ownership and management are deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are frequently changed.Efforts have been stepped up to tackle shadow fleets in recent months and a number of sanctioned tankers have been seized.Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.More on this story",

    "body": "22 hours agoDearbail JordanBusiness reporterEPAThe European Union (EU) has launched a formal investigation into fast fashion giant Shein over possible breaches of digital law, including the sale of childlike sex dolls.The European Commission (EC), the EU's executive arm, said it will examine what systems the Chinese firm has in place to prevent the sale of illegal products \"including content which could constitute child sexual abuse material\".It will also investigate the \"addictive design\" of Shein's platform and the transparency of the system it uses to suggest products and content to shoppers.Shein said: \"Protecting minors and reducing the risk of harmful content and behaviours are central to how we develop and operate our platform.\"Last year, Shein was reported to French authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website.The firm said it removed the products immediately, banned the sellers, and removed the sale of sex dolls \"regardless of appearance\" across its global site. It also said it worked with local and international authorities on investigations into both the buyers and sellers of the childlike sex dolls.The Commission said it will investigate the systems Shein uses to limit the sale of illegal products. It said that would include weapons but declined to specify particular items.It has sent a number of requests for information to Shein in the past and EC spokesperson Thomas Regnier told the BBC's World Business Report that Shein was \"very cooperative\". But the EC said that once there were indications that a platform may have systemic risks for its users, the EC could open proceedings to investigate further.Regnier said the EC was concerned about the \"addictive\" nature of Shein's website, and the \"gamification\" of the platform, including its \"rewards programme\" for consumers.He said that the Commission was not against reward programmes per se, but that online platform algorithms were \"often opaque\".\"You don't know how they're being designed [and] you're not in control of what you see,\" he said.The EC will also examine the transparency of so-called \"recommender systems\" which use a shopper's data to push certain products their way. It said that under the Digital Services Act (DSA), Shein must disclosed the main parameters it uses to recommend products and must provide users with \"at least one easily accessible option\" that is not based on using their data to profile their likely purchases. Opening a formal investigation into a company means that the EC can take \"enforcement steps\" such as fines of up to 6% of a company's global sales. In the most recent figures available, Shein reported $38bn in sales for 2024.A spokesperson for Shein said: \"Over the last few months, we have continued to invest significantly in measures to strengthen our compliance with the DSA. \"These include comprehensive systemic-risk assessments and mitigation frameworks, enhanced protections for younger users, and ongoing work to design our services in ways that promote a safe and trusted user experience,\" it said.",

    "body": "Stephen Colbert says CBS spiked interview with Democrat over FCC fears17 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesUS late-night host Stephen Colbert has accused his network of refusing to broadcast an interview with a Democratic politician over fears of retaliation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).CBS, the network which hosts the programme, denies that it \"prohibited\" the interview from being aired, saying it gave only \"legal guidance\".On Monday night's show, Colbert said that CBS would not show his interview with Texas lawmaker James Talarico out of concerns about a response from the FCC, which has new guidance on equal airtime for political candidates.\"We were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,\" he said.\"Then, then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.\"Colbert, host of The Late Show, went on to explain that new FCC guidance on the \"equal time\" rule - which requires certain TV and radio broadcasters to give equal time to rival political candidates - could have created legal trouble for the network, according to CBS lawyers.The FCC regulates radio, TV and satellite airwaves, giving it power over a range of matters, including mergers and decency complaints.CBS flatly denied Colbert's claims in a statement on Tuesday.\"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep James Talarico,\" the network said. Talarico, 36, is a Democratic candidate for a US Senate seat in Texas. CBS added in a statement: \"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates... and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. \"The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.\"The full interview was later posted on YouTube, where FCC rules do not apply.News content has traditionally been exempted from the \"equal time\" rule.But the FCC has said the rule may soon apply to late-night programmes like Colbert's. It may also apply to political radio programmes, which tend to have more conservative hosts and listeners.After issuing the new guidance in January, Brendan Carr, the FCC chairman known for taking an expansive view of his power, said on X that \"for years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programmes - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. \"Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\" US President Donald Trump has at times said he is considering pulling the FCC licence for several US networks that he says have aired views critical of his presidency. Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, agreed in July to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute with Trump regarding an interview it broadcast on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.Business commentators have questioned whether the deal was made partly so as to not affect Paramount's planned merger with Skydance Media, which Trump had the power to halt.CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC board, condemned the response by CBS, saying Colbert and the network had the First Amendment constitutional right to free speech.\"This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech,\" she said in a statement, adding that the FCC had \"no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes\".She continued: \"It is no secret that Paramount, CBS's parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.\"She has previously accused the FCC's Republican leaders of using the equal-time rule to unfairly penalise critics in violation of the constitutional right to free speech. The Late Show is due to end its 33-year run in May. Colbert has been the host since 2015.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura GozziReutersRussian, American and Ukrainian representatives met in Geneva on Tuesday and WednesdayTalks between Russia, Ukraine and the US aimed at ending Moscow's war in Ukraine have concluded without a breakthrough. The trilateral meetings, held in Geneva, went on late on Tuesday but only lasted two hours on Wednesday. Although US envoy Steve Witkoff had expressed optimism over the talks, both the chief Russian negotiator and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky indicated they had been \"difficult\".After the main talks concluded, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky returned to the venue and held a closed-door meeting with the Ukrainian side for about an hour and a half. No details from that meeting have emerged.Some progress was made on \"military issues\", including the location of the front line and ceasefire monitoring, according to a Ukrainian diplomatic source.But an agreement on the issue of territory - without which no ceasefire can be envisaged - remains elusive, with Moscow and Kyiv's positions still far apart.Russia has not budged in its demand for full control of the eastern Donbas region - made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - which is a non-starter for Ukraine.While conceding talks were challenging, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky added that they had been \"businesslike\" and said another meeting would take place \"soon\".Zelensky also described the negotiations as \"not easy\" due to the difference in the two sides' positions. Rustem Umerov cut a less downbeat tone, saying the discussions had been \"substantive and intensive\" and that while there had been progress, no details could be disclosed \"at this stage\".\"This is complex work that requires alignment among all parties and sufficient time,\" Umerov said.Shortly before the end of the talks was announced, Zelensky accused Russia of \"trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage\".The Russian and Ukrainian delegations last met in US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi earlier in February, which led to the first prisoner exchange in several months. On Wednesday, Zelensky indicated that another swap might be forthcoming. US President Donald Trump, who spearheaded diplomatic efforts to end the war, has been signalling impatience with the deadlock between the two sides. On Monday, he said Ukraine had \"better come to the table, fast\" - a sentiment Zelensky has since rejected, saying it was \"not fair\" that his country should be the one asked to compromise.Four years on from the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, substantial distance still exists between Moscow's demands and what Kyiv might consider a \"just peace\".Kyiv has long rejected Russia's demand for the eastern Donbas, which would mean relinquishing Ukrainian sovereign territory, including several heavily fortified cities and a long defensive line in the region of Donetsk. Many Ukrainians believe giving that territory up would leave the country vulnerable to another Russian invasion. Zelensky himself has drawn parallels with the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler annex the Czech territory of Sudetenland.On Tuesday, Zelensky told US media outlet Axios that any plan to hand over the Donbas would be rejected by Ukrainians if it were put to a referendum. The Ukrainian president is also working to ensure that robust security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again are provided by Kyiv's western allies.Another sticking point in the talks is the status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Ukraine wants Moscow to return it and Zelensky has previously said Kyiv could share control of the plant with the Americans - an arrangement Moscow is unlikely to agree to.Officials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy were present in Geneva and held talks with the Ukrainians on the sidelines of the trilateral meeting. European representatives have struggled to be included in the US-led negotiations, but Zelensky said European participation was \"indespensable\" for any final agreement.Next Tuesday will mark the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war, which has resulted in tens of thousands of military and civilian casualties and displaced millions across Ukraine, continues to shape the lives of Ukrainians, with daily deadly aerial attacks across the country.Four people were killed and 30 injured in Russian artillery and air strikes overnight on Tuesday. Power infrastructure too continues to be targeted across the country, leaving millions without light or heating in one of Ukraine's coldest winters in years.",

    "body": "6 hours agoWycliffe MuiaandPaul Njie,BBC AfricaGetty ImagesNetBlocks reports that multiple online platforms have been restricted, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and WhatsAppGabon's media regulator has announced the suspension of social media platforms \"until further notice\", saying online content has fuelled conflict and deepened divisions in the country.In a televised statement on Tuesday evening, the High Authority for Communication (HAC) cited the \"spread of false information\", \"cyberbullying\" and the \"unauthorised disclosure of personal data\" as reasons for the decision.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported that by Wednesday afternoon multiple online platforms had been restricted, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and WhatsApp.Gabon is led by Gen Brice Oligui Nguema, who won presidential elections last year after leading a coup in 2023.The 50-year-old president is facing growing social unrest, with teachers and civil servants staging strikes over pay and working conditions.The HAC's announcement has come as a shock to the central African nation of about 2.5 million people, where social media is particular popular with younger people who use it for business as well as pleasure.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a restaurant owner in the capital, Libreville, told the BBC the suspension would greatly affect his business, since he uses social media for promotion.\"Almost 40% of my customers decided to order or come to the restaurant after seeing our advertising on social media… I won't be able to catch new customers, because clients are attracted by what they are seeing, reviews from friends, pictures,\" he said.\"We are entering a phase where we don't even know if we are moving forward with global development or if we are sliding backward into total underdevelopment.\"However, a taxi driver seemed unbothered about the move, telling the BBC: \"There's no smoke without fire.\"For the authorities to take such a decision, something must have certainly prompted it.\"At the time he pledged to reform Gabon, a small, oil- and timber-rich country, where digital blackouts were used by the previous governments to control information.For the first time, foreign and independent media were allowed to film the ballot count during the election.The media regulator spokesman, Jean-Claude Mendome, said the suspension was prompted by the recurring dissemination on social networks and digital platforms of \" inappropriate, defamatory, hateful, and insulting content that undermines human dignity, social cohesion, the stability of the republic's institutions, and national security\".Such actions, he said, were likely to \"generate social conflict\" and \"seriously jeopardise national unity, democratic progress, and achievements\".But \"freedom of expression, including freedom of comment and criticism,\" remained \"a fundamental right enshrined in Gabon\", Mendome added.School teachers in Gabon began striking in December over pay and working conditions, with protests over similar grievances spreading to other public sectors, including health and education.More BBC stories on Gabon: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

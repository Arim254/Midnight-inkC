    "body": "Three police officers have been killed and at least 15 other people injured in an apparently deliberate gas explosion at a farmhouse in northern Italy.The blast was triggered as police and firefighters went into the house near Verona to carry out an eviction order for two brothers and a sister in their late 50s and mid-60s. The three victims who died were members of the Carabinieri military police. A man and a woman were arrested at the scene and another man who fled after the explosion was located soon after. All three have been taken to hospital. The blast could be heard some 5km (3 miles) away and images from the scene showed the building reduced to a pile of rubble. The head of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, said the farmhouse was subject to an eviction order due to debts accrued by the three owners.\"This is a time for grieving,\" said Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who added that attempts had been made to evict the three siblings in the past. \"It was clear we were dealing with people who would resist in some way,\" he said. Mediators had been sent to speak to the siblings who had barricaded themselves into the house. When the Carabinieri arrived shortly after 03:00 (01:00 GMT), officials believe one of the siblings triggered the blast.\"Upon entering the house, we were confronted with an act of absolute madness,\" provincial police commander Claudio Papagno told the Ansa news agency.\"A gas cylinder had been ignited, and the explosion directly hit our officers,\" he said.Petrol bombs were also found at the property, the interior minister said.Those injured by the blast included 11 other members of the Carabinieri and well as three members of Italy's state police and a firefighter, Ansa reported.According to the Verona prosecutor, Raffaele Tito, the farmhouse was in a derelict state and had no electricity. The prosecutor believed the blast had taken place on a floor above the entrance and told reporters it was a \"premeditated and voluntary homicide\". Shortly before the explosion, he said officers had \"heard a whistle, probably the gas cylinders being opened\".\"We all knew the situation was dire,\" neighbours told Italian media, adding that the three had previously threatened to \"blow themselves up\" rather than leave the house.Piantedosi said the explosion had left a \"terrible, very painful and dramatic toll\".Defence Minister Guido Crosetto joined other political leaders in paying tribute to the three men who had lost their lives in the service of their country.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBC BanglaDhaka andKelly NgAt least 16 people have died after a huge fire broke out at a garment factory in Bangladesh, with officials warning that the toll could rise.Sixteen bodies have been recovered but were burned beyond recognition, the fire service said. Distraught relatives gathered outside the four-storey factory in Dhaka's Mirpur area on Tuesday in search of their loved ones still missing.The blaze, which broke out at the factory around midday, was extinguished after three hours. But an adjacent chemical warehouse continued to burn, authorities said.Large fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, often due to lax safety standards and poor infrastructure. Hundreds of people have been killed in fires in recent years.Up until 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) yesterday, the fire at the chemical warehouse in Mirpur had not been completely doused, media reports said.Fire service officials have not ascertained which of the two buildings caught fire first. According to eyewitnesses, the chemical warehouse stored bleaching powder, plastic and hydrogen peroxide, all of which can intensify fires. Plastic also releases toxic fumes when burned.Fire service director Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury told local media the victims probably died \"instantly\" after inhaling \"highly toxic gas\". Police and military officers are still trying to locate the owners of the factory and the warehouse, Mr Chowdhury told reporters.An investigation on whether the warehouse was operating legally is also ongoing, he added.Tearful family members stood outside the charred buildings, many of them clutching photographs of their missing relatives. Among them is a man searching desperately for his daughter, Farzana Akhter. \"When I heard about the fire, I came running. But I still haven't found her....I just want my daughter back,\" he told Reuters news agency.In 2021, a fire at a food and drink factory left at least 52 people dead and another 20 injured. The factory was built illegally and had no emergency exit, an investigation later found.In 2019, a fast-moving fire swept through a historic district in Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, including members of a bridal party.The country's most deadly industrial accident to date took place in 2013, when an eight-storey commercial building collapsed owing to a structural failure, killing more than 1,100 people.",

    "body": "11 hours agoAna FaguyWatch: Surveillance video shows suspect setting Pennsylvania governor's mansion on fireThe man accused of setting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence on fire in April was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in state prison as part of a plea deal. Cody Balmer, 38, pleaded guilty to attempted murder, aggravated arson, 22 counts of arson, burglary and other offenses at a court hearing on Tuesday. While the official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged during the fire, people home at the time - including Shapiro, his wife, his four children, and guests and staff members - were able to escape unscathed.Shapiro said his family was supportive of the plea agreement announced by prosecutors.The attack against the governor and his family is part of a wave of political violence in the US, including attempted kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump, the killings of two Minnesota state officials and the killing of commentator Charlie Kirk. At a press conference on Tuesday, the Pennsylvania governor - standing alongside his wife - said his family has had to lean on their faith as they navigated a difficult recovery since the attack.“We will forever be changed by this, we know that time will heal, but the scars will remain,” Shapiro said.Balmer was accused of breaking into the govenor's residence and setting it on fire on the second day of Passover. The governor, who is Jewish, had hosted a Passover celebration the night before. Getty ImagesThe gutted interior of the governor's residenceBalmer had admitted to officials that he removed petrol from a lawn mower and poured it into beer bottles to make Molotov cocktails he used in the attack, Pennsylvania State Police said.He turned himself in 13 hours after the break-in and admitted to “harbouring hatred toward Governor Shapiro”, officials said. Balmer was asked in a police interview what he would have done if he had come face to face with Shapiro. He told police he would have beaten the governor with a hammer, according to an affidavit. Shapiro has served as Pennsylvania's governor since 2023, after working as the state's attorney general.The Democrat was among the top picks to be Kamala Harris's running mate during the 2024 presidential election, but was ultimately passed over. He has frequently been mentioned as a possible future presidential candidate.Getty Images",

Bipin showed courage and threw the grenade out,\" Dhan Bahadur Chaudhary told BBC Nepali.He was speaking after the Israeli military identified his friend's body as being among four dead hostages returned by Hamas under the Gaza ceasefire accord.Bipin was 23 and working on a kibbutz when he was taken by Hamas into captivity along with 250 others on 7 October 2023. It's unclear how or when he died.His family and friends hoped right up to the release deadline that he might be among living hostages returned on 13 October, but he wasn't, and a day later their worst fears were confirmed.Bipin, Dhan Bahadur and 15 other Nepalese agriculture students had been in Israel for just over three weeks when Kibbutz Alumim was attacked.\"We knew that there may be a war in Israel. But we had no idea that there may be any ground attack of that magnitude,\" Dhan Bahadur said. \"We thought that there could be missile attacks and we would be safe if we stay underground, in the bunkers.\"For the students who'd been invited under the Israeli government's \"Earn and Learn Programme\" it was a great opportunity to make better lives for themselves and their families in Nepal.Dhan Bahadur credits his survival to Bipin's courage.\"At the time of attack, two grenades were thrown near the bunkers. He [Bipin] picked up one and threw it outside; one exploded inside. Due to that explosion, I and four others were injured,\" he says.\"He was unharmed at that point. If both grenades had exploded, I would not have been speaking with you like this.\"Ten of the Nepalese students were killed in the attack. Bipin was the only one captured.\"We met for the last time when he and others were being shifted to another bunker,\" Dhan Bahadur says. \"Because, after the injury, I could not move and I stayed in the first bunker. I later came to know that there were two attacks in the bunker where he took shelter and he was held captive from there.\"Courtesy Dhan Bahadur ChaudharyMany of the students can be seen in this selfie inside the bunker 30 minutes before the attack, taken by one of those killedHamas returns four more bodies of hostages, Israeli military saysIsraeli hostages and Palestinian detainees freed as Trump hails 'historic dawn' in Middle East'You're my life, my hero': Hostages reunite with families after two yearsPalestinians celebrate return of detainees freed by IsraelThe 27-year-old says he feels deeply saddened after hearing about his colleague's death. He and Bipin studied together in Far Western University School of Agriculture in Tikapur, Nepal.\"We made all possible efforts from our sides to secure his release. We did everything. But yesterday, we had to face such shocking news. All of Nepal is in grief. I do not know what to say. I have no words to explain my sorrow.\"Dhan Bahadur says Bipin and other colleagues had the same goal of making little savings and starting their own enterprise after returning from the exchange programme in Israel.\"He loved playing football and basketball. We would chat for hours about our goals and dreams. He wanted to get his body in good shape and to buy a new mobile phone. We even recorded a song about friendship with my phone. He also talked about showcasing himself in a music video.\"Dhan Bahadur ChaudharyBipin and Dhan Bahadur with Israeli friends, in a final selfie at the Kibbutz Alumim basketball court On 14 October, the Israeli military said it believed Bipin Joshi was \"murdered in captivity during the first months of the war\". There's no way of independently confirming that.But if it's the case, Dhan Bahadur said, the international community should ask Hamas about why it happened.He said he had not received any support from Nepal's government following his injury but hoped the Israeli government would help Bipin's family.Bipin's immediate family members have not released any statement so far.Footage from 7 October showed him walking inside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. His family received no signs of life for a year, until the Israeli military shared a video of him in captivity around November 2023.Relatives described the footage as \"proof of life\" just hours before the ceasefire deal was agreed, and were hoping for a miracle.Now in his hometown of Bhimdutta municipality Bipin's family are grieving after hearing news of his death.Hostages and Missing Families ForumThe bodies of Bipin Joshi and fellow hostage Guy Illouz were handed over by Hamas in Gaza on MondayHis mother and sister had gone to the United States to lobby for the release of hostages, Bipin's cousin Kishore Joshi told BBC Nepali.He says the family has no words to describe the grief. \"His mother and sister are returning from US on Thursday. The father is not in the condition to express the pain in words.\"Meanwhile it's unclear when Bipin's body will be returned to his family.Israel is making all necessary arrangements to repatriate his remains to Nepal, as it did for the other students who died, Nepal's ministry of foreign affairs said.\"We are all shocked by the news of Bipin Joshi's death. In this time of sorrow [we] extend our deep sympathy to the grieving family,\" it said in a statement of condolence. \"Even after Bipin Joshi's body is brought back to Nepal, we will continue appropriate efforts in co-ordination and co-operation with the concerned government authorities and stakeholders - to uncover the truth about the actual cause and circumstances of his death.\"Dhan Bahadur says he and other colleagues who returned safely from Israel plan to visit Bipin's family in Kanchanpur district.\"We will keep his memories alive. We will provide our care, support and consolation to his family.\"He still feels numb.\"I returned to Nepal and I am studying at the moment. But Bipin's dreams remained unfulfilled.\"",

    "body": "Two French nationals have been handed lengthy prison sentences by a court in Iran after being convicted of espionage, Iranian state media reports.The reports do not name the defendants but they are believed to be Cecile Kohler, 40, and her partner Jacques Paris, 72, the only French nationals being held in Iran. They were arrested in May 2022 during a tourist trip. The pair have been found guilty of spying on behalf of both France and Israel, the reports say.The announcement comes more than a month after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a deal to exchange French detainees for an Iranian woman held in France was nearly complete.Iran has previously said Kohler and Paris could be released as part of that agreement.Another French tourist, Olivier Grondeau, 34, was released by Iran earlier this year after being handed a five-year prison sentence for \"conspiracy against the Islamic republic\".Iran's judicial news agency Mizan said one of the defendants was sentenced to six years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiracy against national security and 20 years in exile for \"intelligence co-operation\" with Israel.The other was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiring against national security and 20 years in exile for being complicit in intelligence co-operation with Israel.Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently. It is unclear what \"exile\" entails, though in other instances convicts have been sent to remote areas.Mizan reports that their pre-trial detention would be deducted from their sentences and that the verdict could be contested within 20 days.France has accused Iran of holding Kohler and Paris arbitrarily and keeping them in conditions akin to torture. Iran denies the claims.Human rights groups say tourists and dual nationals are often held for leverage in diplomatic negotiations, released only when Iran gets something in return.The release of British-Iranian nationals Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori in 2022, after years in detention, came after months of negotiation that saw the UK settle a debt of nearly £400m dating from the 1970s.Kohler and Paris were touted as exchangeable for Mahdieh Esfandiari, who has been held in France since February on charges of promoting terrorism on social media. Iran has repeatedly called her detention arbitrary.Iran is thought to currently hold around 20 Europeans in detention, according to news agency AFP.These include British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman, who were detained in January while travelling through Iran on a motorcycling world tour and later charged with espionage.Their family maintains they are innocent and are being held in \"horrific conditions\".Last week, 18-year-old French-German cyclist Lennart Monterlos was released after an Iranian court acquitted him of espionage charges.",

    "body": "The US Supreme Court has rejected a request from right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to overturn the nearly $1.5bn (£1.1bn) defamation judgment against him. Jones was ordered to make the payout in 2022 for claiming the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School - which killed 20 schoolchildren and six educators - was a hoax. In order to make that payout, Jones was being forced to sell his Infowars media company to the satirical news site The Onion. He told the highest US court the sale would cause irreparable harm to him and his audience of 30 million.Jones has not yet paid any of the damages he owes Sandy Hook families.The Supreme Court did not explain its decision to deny his request. Jones’s lawyers had made a free speech argument - that he should have the same protections under the First Amendment of the Constitution that journalists have. And Jones argued the financial consequences were too steep.\"The result is a financial death penalty by fiat imposed on a media defendant whose broadcasts reach millions,\" he told the Supreme Court in the appeal. Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, said in a statement provided to BBC that the court “properly rejected Jones's latest desperate attempt to avoid accountability for the harm he has caused. \"We look forward to enforcing the jury's historic verdict and making Jones and Infowars pay for what they have done.\"While The Onion's attempt to buy Infowars was rejected by a bankruptcy judge last year, Infowars could soon be up for sale again, giving The Onion another chance. Legal pressure against Jones has been mounting since he was found liable by two juries for defamation and emotional distress over his lies about the Sandy Hook school shooting. After the first verdict in Connecticut, Jones filed for bankruptcy protection in Texas, and Infowars was put up for auction to pay the Sandy Hook families, who had sued to collect on the judgment.It was during Texas court proceedings that Jones acknowledged the attack was \"100% real\". He had previously claimed the massacre was \"staged\" as part of a government plot to take guns from Americans and that \"no-one died\". ",

    "body": "7 hours agoIone WellsSouth America Correspondent andNadine YousifThe US has struck another vessel off the coast of Venezuela on Tuesday, killing six people, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the vessel belonged to \"narcoterrorists\" and that it was \"trafficking narcotics\". This is the fifth strike of its kind by the Trump administration on a boat accused of trafficking drugs on international waters since September. In total, 27 people have been reported killed, but the US has not provided evidence or details about identities of the vessels or those on board them.Some lawyers have accused the US of breaching international law, and neighbouring nations like Colombia and Venezuela have condemned the strikes.In his Truth Social post, Trump said \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known\" route for smuggling. He also posted an aerial surveillance video showing a small boat on water that is struck by a missile and explodes.US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': What do we know, and was it legal?What is Trump's goal as US bombs 'Venezuela drugs boat'?Trump did not specify the nationality of those on board, or what drug smuggling organisation they are suspected of belonging to. He added that no US military personnel were injured. The strike comes after a recent leaked memo sent to Congress, and reported on by US media, that said the administration determined the US was in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. It has also deployed multiple warships to the Caribbean. The US has positioned its strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels as self-defence. Many lawyers questioning the legality of such military action.Framing this as an active armed conflict is likely a way for Trump to justify using more extreme wartime powers – for example killing \"enemy fighters\" even if they have not posed a violent threat, or detaining people indefinitely.While it is true that some drug trafficking occurs in Venezuela, and some cartels operate in the region that some of these vessels allegedly have originated from, it is not considered a hotspot for drug trafficking compared to some other locations in the region.As a result, many believe this is part of a wider political campaign to put military pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.The strikes come after the US announced a $50m (£37m) reward for any information leading to the arrest of Maduro - whose election to lead the country has been widely rejected by the international community - on drug-trafficking charges.Venezuela's government has reacted to previous recent strikes with anger. Maduro denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking, while another official has questioned the veracity of footage posted by Trump.",

    "body": "5 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged that a $20bn (£15bn) US lifeline to help calm Argentina's currency crisis is an attempt to sway legislative elections this month in the South American nation.Welcoming Argentina's libertarian leader Javier Milei to the White House, Trump warned that the US would not \"waste our time\" with helping Argentina if Milei's party did not prevail.Milei praised Trump for his peacemaking efforts and said the US president's policies would lead to \"prosperity\".Argentina's financial turmoil comes ahead of national midterm elections on 26 October, seen as a test of voters' desire to continue backing Milei's cost-cutting, free-market reform agenda.As Trump sat across the table from his Argentine counterpart on Tuesday, he said the not-so-quiet bit out loud.\"The election is coming up very soon,\" he said. \"It's a very big election.\"Trump added: \"Victory [for Milei] is very important. Your poll numbers I hear are pretty good. I think they will be better after this.\"And, you know, our approvals are somewhat subject to who wins the election.\"A presidential election is not due in Argentina until 2027. But Trump said if \"a socialist wins\" then the US would feel \"a lot differently\" about supporting the South American nation.\"If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,\" Trump said.For his part, Milei blamed Argentina's economic woes on his political adversaries.\"This liquidity problem that Argentina has is a result of the political attacks we have suffered from our opponents,\" he told Trump.How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over TrumpTrump is bailing out Argentina. What happened to 'America first'?Trump's backing for his libertarian ally, who took office in December 2023, is no secret.But his explicit linking of a recently announced $20bn currency swap between the US and Argentina to Milei's electoral prospects is notable for an American president who has previously railed against foreign interference in elections.In recent provincial elections in Buenos Aires, Milei's La Libertad Avanza coalition (Freedom Advances) performed worse than expected, spooking markets as they watch for any sign his economic programme's days might be numbered.His party has recently been rocked by several corruption scandals.If Milei's party loses seats, or fails to gain more, in this month's midterms – that could affect his government's ability to pass further reforms.Several key vetoes he has tried to make have already been overturned by Congress, where he doesn't have a majority.But will US support actually make a difference?Argentine stocks fell after Tuesday's news conference.This intervention, which was supposed to stabilise the economy in Argentina, now seemed to hinge on Milei securing more political support.And it seems the financial markets are unconvinced that Trump's endorsement will be enough to boost Milei's electoral chances.This currency swap was, economically speaking, supposed to be a bit of a lifeline for Argentina's currency – the peso, which has been losing value for years.As a means to control inflation, Milei had been stopping the peso from devaluing too drastically by keeping it propped up with the country's reserves.The problem with that is that it drained reserves ahead of $20bn of debt due next year.That led to fears, including among investors, that the country was heading for a financial crisis if it defaulted on its debts again.Some thought that to avert this Milei might have to let the currency devalue drastically – which would lead to a spike in prices as people's money would suddenly be worth less.Many economists told me they thought this would be \"political suicide\". So, perhaps the US intervention helps avoid that political disaster.But is this really going to cut through to ordinary voters? Opinion polls suggest that some Argentines are tiring of Milei's sharp austerity measures.His supporters hail them for bringing down inflation and cutting the deficit.But they've come at a social cost – with large cuts to pensions, education, health, infrastructure, and transport and utilities subsidies among other things.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoLauren Turner andOsmond ChiaReutersThe US government has seized more than $14bn (£10.5bn) in bitcoin and charged the founder of a Cambodian business empire, Prince Group, with allegedly masterminding a massive cryptocurrency scam.UK and Cambodian national Chen Zhi was charged on Tuesday in New York for allegedly engaging in a wire-fraud conspiracy and running a money laundering scheme.Mr Chen's businesses were also sanctioned by the US and the UK as part of a joint operation. The UK government says it has frozen assets owned by his network, including 19 properties in London - one of which is worth nearly £100m ($133m).The BBC has contacted the Prince Group for comment.US prosecutors say it is one the biggest financial takedowns in history and the largest ever seizure of bitcoin, with approximately 127,271 bitcoin being held by US government.Mr Chen, who remains at large, is accused of being the mastermind behind a \"sprawling cyber-fraud empire\" operating under his multi-national company, the Prince Group, said the US Department of Justice (DOJ).The Cambodia-based group's website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. But the DOJ alleges that it runs one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organisations.Unwitting victims were contacted online and convinced to transfer cryptocurrency based on false promises that the funds would be invested and generate profits, the DOJ said.Prosecutors alleged that the company, under Mr Chen's direction, built and operated at least ten scam compounds throughout Cambodia, according to court documents seen by the BBC.Mr Chen was accused of managing the compounds that were specially designed to reach as many victims as possible, said prosecutors.His accomplices allegedly procured millions of mobile phone numbers and set up \"phone farms\" to conduct call centre scams, according to the court documents, dated 8 October.Two of these facilities had 1,250 mobile phones that controlled around 76,000 social media accounts for scams, the documents said.Prosecutors said Prince Group documents included tips on building rapport with victims, advising workers not to use profile photos of women who were \"too beautiful\" so that the accounts would look more genuine.US District Court EDNYCourt documents contained images of \"phone farms\" allegedly used to conduct  scamsAssistant Attorney General for National Security John A Eisenberg described the Prince Group as a \"criminal enterprise built on human suffering\".It also trafficked workers, who were confined in prison-like compounds and forced to carry out scams online, targeting thousands of victims worldwide, he said.Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly used the criminal proceeds for luxury travel and entertainment, said the DOJ. They also made \"extravagant\" purchases like watches, private jets and rare artwork, including a Picasso painting purchases from a New York City auction house, the department said.If convicted, Mr Chen faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in jail.In Britain, Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly incorporated businesses in the British Virgin Islands and invested in UK property. His network's assets include a £100m office building on central London, a £12m mansion in North London and seventeen flats in the city, said the UK foreign office on Tuesday.Being sanctioned, as part of a joint operation with US authorities, means he is now locked out of the UK's financial system.The Prince Group has also been sanctioned in the US and labelled as a criminal organisation.They were \"ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money\", UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.Cooper said: \"Together with our US allies, we are taking decisive action to combat the growing transnational threat posed by this network - upholding human rights, protecting British nationals and keeping dirty money off our streets.\"The foreign office said Mr Chen and the Prince Group built casinos and compounds used as scam centres and laundered the proceeds.Four businesses linked to the alleged scams - The Prince Group, Jin Bei Group, Golden Fortune Resorts World and Byex Exchange -  have also been sanctioned, said the foreign office.Two scam centres allegedly run by Jin Bei Group and Golden Fortune Resorts were named earlier this year in an Amnesty International report on the use of forced labour and torture in Cambodian scam centres.People working in scam centres are often foreign nationals lured by the promise of a legitimate job, and then forced to carry out scams under threat of torture, the foreign office said.These scammers operate on an \"industrial scale\", including in the UK, using tricks like fake romantic relationships to lure victims into being scammed, said the foreign office.Fraud Minister Lord Hanson said: \"Fraudsters prey on the most vulnerable by stealing life savings, ruining trust, and devastating lives. We will not tolerate this.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoBruno BoelpaepIn Brussels andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPolice used water cannon and tear gas at one point when the protest turned violentTens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Brussels as part of a national strike over government reforms and spending cuts that has brought flights to a halt and severely disrupted public transport.Belgium's three big unions are protesting over pensions and other measures by Prime Minister Bart de Wever's centre-right government aimed at cutting the budget deficit.There were no services at Belgium's second biggest airport at Charleroi, and all departures and many of the arrivals were cancelled at Brussels Airport.Although trains were running, most buses, trams and underground trains in the capital ground to a halt.Shipping at Europe's second biggest port Antwerp was suspended until Wednesday because of understaffing, and more than 100 ships waited in the North Sea for permission to dock at three ports, according to Belgium's MDK maritime and coastal services.Belgium has been hit by several strikes since Flemish nationalist Bart de Wever came to office last February.By midday, police said 80,0000 protesters had joined the demonstration in the Belgian capital.ReutersDemonstrators held a banner that read \"social health: vital\"Public sector workers were protesting against austerity measures and a government increasingly perceived as leaning right.They wound through the streets of central Brussels, many wearing the red or green colours of the main unions. A key issue for the unions is the government's plan to increase the number of days Belgians work per year before they can receive their pensions, as well as the end of special schemes for several sectors including military and railway workers. De Wever's government has also announced measures including a maximum two-year limit on claiming unemployment benefit. Further cuts are planned for next year's budget, and some proposals such as reducing child benefit or raising VAT have already been floated.\"It's about time we came together,\" said Anaïs, 29. \"It's always the same part of the population that has to tighten their belts.\"Bruno Boelpaep/BBCAnaïs complained that the government's pension reforms would not affect wealthier BelgiansHolding a placard showing the number 67 with a red line through it, she objected to the pension age going up: \"65 is enough. 67 is too late. We are asked to work more, to work longer hours. It's not fair.\"The rise in pension age was adopted 10 years ago, well before De Wever's government came to office, but it remains deeply unpopular and the government is aiming to ringfence it and make it more expensive to retire earlier.Thierry Bodson of the ABVV union told demonstrators that \"the fight against the De Wever government is not just the fight of a day or a year - it's for a whole generation\", Belga news agency reported.\"We need to fight for our rights,\" said mother-of-two Vanessa, who had travelled from Charleroi. \"I'm worried about the measures that will be taken. What sort of future will my children have?\" she told the BBC.It is not just the federal government under pressure to cut spending. Belgium's complex multi-level governance means regional authorities are also imposing austerity measures. The ruling coalition in Belgium's largely French-speaking Walloon region has announced that teachers in the higher tiers of secondary schools will have to work an extra two hours per week. Many of them joined the protests today.\"Nothing is clear, and it's really worrying, but if higher-level teachers have to work more, many jobs will be cut,\" said Sandrine, 48, who works in education.Although the protests were largely peaceful, there were several incidents of vandalism and arson early in the morning and some people in masks clashed with police later on.",

    "body": "12 hours agoLaura Gozzi andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu announced the planned suspension two days before his new government faced votes of confidenceFrench Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has told parliament he backs suspending controversial 2023 pension reforms, in the face of crucial votes of no-confidence later this week.The changes, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, were seen as signature reforms in Emmanuel Macron's presidency.\"This autumn I will propose to parliament that we suspend the 2023 pension reform until the [2027] presidential election,\" Lecornu said to applause from left-wing parties.Lecornu was reappointed prime minister last week only four days after he resigned, and needs the support of Socialist MPs in parliament if his government is to survive.Opposition parties on the far right and far left have called confidence votes, known as \"censure\" votes on Lecornu's government, for Thursday morning and are demanding parliamentary elections.The Socialists said they would be prepared to support the new government, but only if it promises a complete suspension of Macron's pension changes.\"If he does not explicitly say the words 'immediate and complete suspension of the pension reform', it will be censure,\" Socialist MP Laurent Baumel said earlier on French TV.\"He is holding his destiny in his own hands. He knows what he has do if he doesn't want to be the prime minister who resigns every week.\"The reforms were finally pushed through parliament in March 2023, less than a year after Macron was voted in for a second presidential term.There had been months of political debate, strikes and street protests, and in the end the bill had to go through without a vote in parliament using a constitutional mechanism known as 49:3. Last week, Lecornu said it was something many French people remembered as a \"wound on democracy\" .On Tuesday he made it plain to MPs that suspending the pension reform would cost €400m (£350m) in 2026 and a further €1.8bn (£1.57bn) in 2027. This will have to be \"compensated by other savings,\" Lecornu said.Lecornu is France's third prime minister in the past year but even if he does survive he needs to get a budget through parliament that brings down a budget deficit heading for 5.4% of economic output (GDP) this year. France's public debt earlier this year stood at €3.4tn, or almost 114% of GDP, the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.Lecornu has been one of Macron's most loyal allies, so his decision to row back on such a contested reform shows how keen the president is to avoid further turmoil.Philippe Aghion, who was jointly awarded the 2025 Nobel economics prize on Monday, said earlier that he also backed a suspension of the pension reform, because it would still come at a smaller cost than the instability that would follow another government collapse.\"We're living through an era of crisis,\" Lecornu told MPs. \"Some people want the situation to turn into a regime crisis, but that won't happen.\"Promising a \"serious and reliable budget\", the prime minister also vowed to bring an end to reliance on the 49:3 mechanism to push through legal changes without a vote. Since late 2022, every budget has had to be forced through without a vote.Repeatedly, he told the chamber that \"the government will propose, we will debate and you will vote\".Parliament will have \"the final word\", he said.To audible groans from MPs, Lecornu proposed a working group to look into pensions, and said it would have to come to a decision by the time of the next presidential election.France's budget deficit is far above the EU target of 3% of GDP, and Lecornu said that reversing the pension reform would have to be \"financially compensated, including through cost-saving measures. It cannot be carried out at the expense of an increased deficit\".Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally (RN) and the radical-left France Unbowed (LFI) of Jean-Luc Mélenchon have both tabled confidence votes in Lecornu's government on Thursday, but would need the support of centre-left parties to bring him down.The RN's Sébastien Chenu confirmed his party would vote against Lecornu later this week. \"We are not fooled by anything and cannot be bought,\" he said. \"Hello and goodbye, Mr Prime Minister.\"Mathilde Panot of France Unbowed also railed against Lecornu and Macron. \"Nobody believes in you any longer,\" she said.But a triumphant Boris Vallaud of the Socialists said the prime minister's decision on the pension reform was a \"victory\".\"The French were waiting for your statement and we were waiting for a sign that you'd heard them... The suspension of the pension reform: here it is at last.\"The support of the centrist bloc and the Socialists should give Lecornu enough votes to pass his budget in parliament – but the numbers remain extremely tight, and any breaking of the ranks could result in him being toppled.Le Pen and Mélenchon believe elections are the only way of ending the political deadlock that came out of snap elections called by Macron in the summer of 2024.That deadlock turned to turmoil last week when Lecornu resigned as prime minister 26 days after Macron had appointed him, and only hours after he had named his government.In a week of political twists and drama, Macron then reappointed him late on Friday.The move was widely seen as a last-ditch attempt by the president to exercise control over an increasingly rudderless National Assembly, which has been splintered into three distinct factions since the 2024 vote.That hung parliament has resulted in two short-lived prime ministers who were voted down within months when they attempted to put forward their yearly budgets.Eight days ago, Lecornu stood down before he could even face MPs.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAna Faguy andMark SavageMusic correspondentFrans Schellekens/RedfernsAward-winning R&B and soul singer D’Angelo has died aged 51 after a cancer diagnosis, his family has said. In a statement, they wrote that the star, whose real name was Michael Eugene Archer, left behind a \"legacy of extraordinarily moving music\" and asked fans to celebrate “the gift of song that he has left for the world”.The influential singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz. His three albums won D'Angelo four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D'Angelo appeared to be performing naked.\"The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,\" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US media partner. Tributes have flooded in, with rappers Doja Cat and Missy Elliot, as well as singers Jill Scott and Jennifer Hudson paying their respects.\"A true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come,\" Doja Cat wrote on X. Jennifer Hudson said \"we lost a true original today\".\"D'Angelo, your voice will live on forever. Rest well, King!!!\"Tyler the Creator said his \"musical DNA\" was shaped by D'Angelo - \"We are so lucky to have been alive to enjoy his art,\" he wrote.ReutersThe award-winning singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazzD’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the number 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot on the music scene.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano when he was just three years old.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.Getty ImagesD'Angelo's song Lady earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music sceneIt went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016.Among those paying tribute was hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie.\"Such a sad loss,\" he wrote on social media. \"We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.\"The Voodoo album which was released in 2000 topped the US charts and in its most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album.D'Angelo had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq.",

    "body": "An elite military unit has said it has seized power in Madagascar from President Andry Rajoelina following weeks of youth-led protests over water and power cuts across the country. Crowds were seen celebrating in the streets of the country's capital Antananarivo. Standing outside the presidential palace on Tuesday, CAPSAT chief Col Michael Randrianirina said the military would form a government and hold elections within two years. CAPSAT stands for Personnel Administration and Technical and Administrative Services Corps, and is the most powerful military unit in Madagascar. Rajoelina's whereabouts are unknown, but he has said he is sheltering in a \"safe place\" following an alleged attempt on his life by \"military personnel and politicians\". CAPSAT has denied any involvement in any such move.More on this story here",

    "body": "12 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporter, in Tel AvivBBCRotem Cooper says his father's body not being returned was a \"disappointment\"The son of an Israeli hostage whose body remains in Gaza has told the BBC he is dealing with the realisation that \"it's not over and it's going to be a longer battle\".Rotem Cooper, whose father Amiram is among 24 hostages whose bodies were not returned to Israel on Monday, said the families were trying \"to find the strength somehow to pick ourselves up... and continue the fight\".He called on US President Donald Trump, Qatar, Egypt and other countries involved in peace deal negotiations \"to show Hamas that this is not acceptable\".A ceasefire and hostage release agreement signed by Israel and Hamas stated that the remaining hostages in Gaza would be returned by noon on Monday, with nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel released in exchange.While the 20 hostages still alive were released, a copy of the agreement published by Israeli media appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not be able to locate all of the bodies of the deceased hostages by the deadline.Follow updates on this storyTheir families had pinned their hopes on their loved one returning on Monday, after two years in captivity.\"We hoped and expected that maybe 15 to 20 out of the 28 deceased hostages would be released, but that didn't happen. Only four were announced,\" Mr Cooper said.Family handoutAmiram Cooper was kidnapped from his home alongside his wife on 7 October 2023He described the news as a \"very big disappointment\" for the families.\"It's clear to us that they could have and should have released more and [that] they're playing games.\"Mr Cooper's parents were both kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His mother was released later that month while his father was killed in captivity.Who are the released hostages?Israel identifies bodies of four deceased hostagesWhat happens next in Gaza ceasefire plan after hostage release?The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had been operating in the area at the time but did not confirm how he was killed, referring the BBC this week to a previous statement saying the circumstances were \"under examination\". Hamas has claimed he was killed by an Israeli military strike.AFP via Getty ImagesDozens of people were at Re'im military base to see the return of the hostages on MondayThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of many of the hostages, has called for \"a very serious response\" from the Israeli government and mediators, for what is described as Hamas's \"violation of the agreement\". It said further stages of the peace plan should not progress until all the remaining bodies had been returned.Mr Cooper headed to the Re'im military base in southern Israel on Monday to see the return of the 20 living hostages.In recorded voice messages sent throughout the day, he described feeling \"tremendous anticipation\" and a \"big relief\" as he saw them return. But he added that the thought of the bodies coming back to Israel was \"heartbreaking\".Family handoutRuby Chen (R) with his son Itay (L), whose body still remains in GazaSpeaking again the following day, after the news that the four bodies returned did not include Amiram's, he described the experience as a \"big rollercoaster\".Mr Cooper said the return of his father's body would allow him to have \"some closure\" and to \"sleep better at night\".\"Everything has been on hold,\" he said.Ruby Chen, whose son Itay's body remains in Gaza, said he had experienced a similar mix of emotions.\"We were overjoyed [on Monday] to see 20 hostages coming out and being reunited with their families, but we were very disappointed not to see more deceased hostages coming out,\" he said in a video message shared with the BBC by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\"We request the Israeli government, the US and the mediators to continue the fight and put pressure on Hamas to adhere [to] and follow the agreement that was signed and bring back all the remaining 24 hostages in captivity,\" Mr Chen added.The Israeli military said on Tuesday that, following forensic tests, it had identified the four hostages whose bodies had been returned and had informed their families that their loved ones had been reburied.They were 26-year-old Israeli Guy Illouz, Bipin Joshi, a Nepalese citizen who was 23, Yossi Sharabi, a 53-year-old Israeli, and 22-year-old Daniel Peretz, an Israeli-South African dual national.",

    "body": "About a dozen of us walked into a US immigration office in Virginia on Saturday morning, people born all over the world excited to take the final step in becoming American citizens.We clutched our naturalisation notices as we filed through security and lined up at the check-in desk. Soon, we would raise our right hands and swear the Oath of Allegiance to the United States in a ceremony that is known as both solemn and celebratory. Carrying small American flags, we would walk out citizens.But then, abruptly, we learned the ceremony had been cancelled because of the government shutdown.\"You should have been notified,\" said the staff member at the desk.None of us had received any emails or phone calls. The staff at the entrance had let us in without warning, raising the possibility that they too had not been notified.Later, when I checked the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website, it was temporarily down.When it came back online, I saw my appointment had been cancelled days earlier \"due to unforeseen circumstances.\" If you hadn't checked the website yourself, you would never have known.\"We regret any inconvenience this may cause,\" the notice said.Around me at the office, disappointment quickly turned into confusion.One woman in a hijab quietly asked if I had been turned away too, worried it might have been because of her clothing. A man had gathered his family to celebrate his final step to becoming a US citizen, only to leave anxious and uncertain.  A few people seemed genuinely frightened, wondering how the delay might affect their work, lives and plans.This was more than an inconvenience.Some of us had spent years plodding through paperwork and interviews, as well as preparing for the citizenship test.  After more than a decade of having a green card, I had decided to become a citizen and vote. All of us now were stuck in limbo.At the office, we were told to come back on 1 November. With the ongoing federal shutdown, though, there's a chance that could slip.The immigration service is largely funded by application fees and so it typically stays open during a government shutdown.But its director, Joseph Edlow, said in a post on X that public-facing services such as interviews and naturalisation ceremonies can be delayed. He added that the agency \"regrets any negative impacts but must ensure it complies with the law\".It's unclear how many USCIS appointments or oath ceremonies have been cancelled nationwide. The service lists field office closures on a web page, but it does not provide totals for cancelled ceremonies.  Anecdotal reports have circulated online about other oath ceremonies that have been scrapped.What's also unclear is when the government will reopen.Republicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over government funding since 1 October, leading to a shutdown that has placed more than 700,000 federal workers on unpaid leave.Add on the many rapid changes made to US immigration policies in the last nine months, and the anxiety among those of us working to become American citizens can only rise. The effects of a Washington stalemate are rippling into the everyday lives - and possibly futures - of those of us hoping to call the US our permanent home.",

    "body": "2 days agoRozina SiniandTom BennettReutersA train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash on TuesdayA passenger has described \"chaos\" after two trains collided head-on near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.Niels Honkoop, 33, told the BBC he had switched seats part-way through the journey from the middle of the train to the back, before it crashed, injuring many of those sitting near the front.\"I saw staff running around and people crying and people on the floor and chaos erupted,\" he said. \"We got off the train and I saw people bleeding with very severe injuries.\"A train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash, which took place at around 13:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Tuesday. Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Niels HonkoopNiels Honkoop (right) described the accident as \"chaos\"\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuMore on this story",

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is among some 60 female lawmakers petitioning for more women's toilets in the parliament building to match their growing representation in the legislature.A record 73 women were elected into the 465-seat Lower House in October 2024, exceeding the previous high of 54 in 2009.One opposition lawmaker, Yasuko Komiyama, said there were often \"long queues in front of the restroom... before plenary sessions start\", and quoted another MP who said she had \"given up\" going to the toilet before a session began. There is one female toilet with two cubicles near the plenary chamber, though the entire building itself has nine female toilets with 22 cubicles.There are a total of 12 men's toilets with 67 stalls and urinals across the building, according to local media reports. The current situation is \"often inconvenient\" because female staff and visitors also share the toilets, said Ms Komiyama from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party.\"I want to raise my voice and prepare myself for the day when women hold more than 30% of [parliamentary seats] in the future,\" she wrote in a post on Facebook.Japan's parliament building was built in 1936, a decade before women were given the right to vote in 1945. The first women were appointed to parliament in 1946.The parliament building is a sprawling three-storey structure, with a central portion that is nine storeys high. The building occupies 13,356 square metres (143,800 sq ft), the equivalent of about two football pitches, with a total floor area of 53,464 square metres.\"If the administration is serious about promoting women's empowerment, I believe we can count on their understanding and cooperation,\" Komiyama said, according to Japanese media.Chair of the Lower House committee Yasukazu Hamada has \"expressed a willingness\" to consider the proposal for more women's toilets, said an Asahi Shimbun report. The Japanese government earlier set a target of having 30% of leadership roles across all sectors of society held by women by 2020, but at the end of that year the timeframe was quietly pushed back by a decade.Women currently hold nearly 16% of the seats in the Lower House and about a third – or 42 out of 125 seats – in the Upper House.Takaichi, who became Japan's first female leader in October last year, had pledged to raise female representation in her cabinet to levels comparable to Nordic countries, which hold the top spots in terms of female leadership.But she has appointed just two other women to her 19-member cabinet.In Japan, the dearth of women's restrooms extends beyond the legislative chamber.Long lines in front of women's public restrooms are a common sight nationwide. Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had said his government would look into \"enhancing women's restroom facilities\" to make Japan a society where \"women can live their lives with peace of mind\".",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has warned Iran's authorities against killing peaceful protesters, saying Washington \"will come to their rescue\".In a brief post on social media, he wrote: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\" He gave no further details.A senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded by saying Trump should \"be careful\" if he intervened, warning of potential chaos across the Middle East.At least six people are reported to have been killed in Iran on Thursday after almost a week of mass protests sparked by worsening economic conditions. In Friday's post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"Khamenei adviser Ali Larijani warned shortly afterwards that any US interference would destabilise the region.\"Trump should know that US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilising the entire region and destroying America's interests,\" he wrote.In his post, the US president did not specify what action Washington could take against the Iranian authorities.In June, the US carried out strikes against Iran's nuclear sites on Trump's orders. American officials later argued that the strikes had significantly set back the prospect of Tehran building a nuclear weapon - a claim disputed by Iran.In retaliation, Iran launched a missile attack on a major US military base in Qatar.In Iran, six people were reported to have been killed on a fifth day of protests on Thursday.Two people died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw.Three people were killed in Azna and another in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reports.Fars did not specify whether those killed were demonstrators or members of the security forces.Hengaw said the two killed in Lordegan were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.Footage posted on social media showed cars set on fire during running battles between protesters and security forces.BBC Persian has verified videos showing Thursday's protests in Lordegan, Tehran and Marvdasht in the southern Fars province.Iranian officials earlier said a member of the country's securities forces had been killed on Wednesday in the western city of Kouhdasht. The BBC has not been able to verify this and protesters say the man was one of their number and was shot dead by the security forces.The protests began on Sunday in Tehran among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Many protesters have since been calling for the end of Khamenei's rule. Some have said they want a return to the monarchy.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the country's Prosecutor-General, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoMayeni JonesAfrica correspondent, JohannesburgChristian Parkinson / BBCArnold Ncube was unable to complete his education because he could not prove he was South AfricanMany people may take their birth certificate, or similar official papers, for granted - hidden in a drawer and rarely seeing the light of day - but for those without one, it can lead to a shadow life or an uncertain existence.This is thought to affect millions of people around the world, described as stateless, and 25-year-old South African Arnold Ncube is one of those.Because he has no state-issued documents, washing cars in the backstreets of Thembisa township near Johannesburg is one of the few ways he can make a living.He was born in Johannesburg and his father is South African, qualifying him for citizenship here. But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.Ed Habershon / BBCChristy Chitengu only found out at 17 that she was statelessHuman rights lawyer and advocate Christy Chitengu used to be stateless herself.She only got South African citizenship three years ago with the help of the organisation Lawyers for Human Rights who worked on her case for free.\"I found out I was stateless at the age of 17. My high school principal called me into her office and told me that she didn't have any documents for me and that she didn't understand how I'd gotten into the school,\" she tells the BBC near her home in northern Johannesburg.\"I was born in Johannesburg to two foreign parents [both from Zimbabwe] and at my birth I was given a handwritten South African birth certificate.\"But officials in South Africa need a printed certificate.Christy says that when she found out she was stateless she looked into taking her parents' nationality but it was too late.\"I couldn't claim my Zimbabwean citizenship because by that time I was 16 and they wouldn't allow me to do a late birth registration. Also I would have had to physically leave South Africa to get a Zimbabwean passport and without any documents to leave the country, I wouldn't be allowed back in.\"South Africa has large numbers of undocumented migrants and the authorities and local vigilante groups have been trying to crack down on irregular migration for years.When asked whether giving stateless children citizenship could be seen as a reward to undocumented migrants who give birth in South Africa, Christy disagrees.\"I think citizenship is not a reward. It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being. I think if we look at it through that lens, we realise that there's nothing that we lose by recognising a child who would otherwise not be able to go to primary school or receive healthcare.\"Getty ImagesIn South Africa, an estimated 10,000 people are stateless On several occasions, the BBC contacted the home affairs department, which handles immigration issues in South Africa, to find out how it is tackling the issue of statelessness but got no reply.Statelessness is not just an issue here, it is a huge global problem.There's an estimated 4.5 million stateless people around the world. Some say the figure could even be as high as 15 million.Experts believe tackling the problem requires policy changes, including allowing refugees to register their children where they're born, and giving mothers the right to pass their nationality to their children.\"For us statelessness is not just a legal issue, it's a matter that involves the right to development,\" says Jesus Perez Sanchez who works for the UNHCR.\"That person that's affected by statelessness will not be able to contribute fully to that country that is hosting. So we think that it's important that as a matter of inclusion, all issues of statelessness are addressed so that all these people on the margins of society can contribute fully to society and the economy.\"Back in Thembisa, Arnold is playing football with local children.After years of struggle, he now has a lawyer helping him fight for the papers that prove he belongs here. He wants to go back to school to study computer science. He hopes having documents will lead to a brighter future.Additional reporting by Christian ParkinsonMore from South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said on Thursday he was open to talks with the US on drug trafficking and oil, after weeks of an escalating pressure campaign against his government.In an interview with Venezuelan state TV, Maduro said he was ready for dialogue with the US \"wherever they want and whenever they want\". He also evaded a question about a statement by President Donald Trump that the US had hit a docking facility in Venezuela - the first such attack inside the country reportedly carried out by the CIA. US forces have been hitting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific for the past three months.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" , with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September.The latest attack came on Wednesday when two boats alleged to be carrying drugs were struck, killing five people on board, according to the US military.On Monday, Trump said the US had carried out a strike on a \"dock area\" linked to alleged Venezuelan drug boats, causing a \"major explosion\".The blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA, according to CNN and the New York Times, which cited sources close to the matter. If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.But Maduro was elusive in the interview. Asked if he could confirm or deny the attack, Maduro said \"this could be something we talk about in a few days\". As well as drug trafficking, Maduro also said he was open for talks on oil and migration.In recent months, Trump has focused on fighting the influx of drugs - especially fentanyl and cocaine - into the US.The US president has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture and has announced that he would designate the Maduro government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.Counternarcotic experts say that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, acting as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is thought to enter the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.Without providing evidence, Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US.Close to eight million Venezuelans are estimated to have fled the country's economic crisis and repression since 2013 - some heading for the US.The US has also been cracking down on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.US forces seized an oil tanker off Venezuela on 10 December, saying it was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\". Venezuela described it as an act of \"international piracy\". Since then, the US has seized one more oil tanker and pursued a third. The Trump administration has cast its operations against alleged drug boats as a non-international armed conflict against the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs. But the US Southern Command again insisted this week that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterChina's BYD is set to overtake Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of  electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival for annual sales.On Thursday, BYD said that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million.Tesla, which is due to reveal its total sales for 2025 later on Friday, last week published analysts' estimates suggesting that it had sold around 1.65 million vehicles for the year as a whole.The US firm has faced a tough year with a mixed reception to new offerings, unease over Musk's political activities and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.Chinese firms such as Geely, MG, and BYD - now the country's largest electric car company - have put pressure on Western rivals by pricing their vehicles below established brands.In October, Tesla responded by launching lower-priced versions of its two best selling models in the US in a bid to boost sales.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package. The deal, which was approved by shareholders in November, could see him getting a payout of as much as $1tn (£740bn).As part of the agreement, Musk also has to sell a million humanoid robots over the next ten years. Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\".Tesla sales slumped in the first three months of 2025 after a backlash against Musk's role in US President Donald Trump's administration.Besides Tesla, the multi-billionaire's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels.Those commitments, along with running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.Since then Musk has pledged to \"significantly\" cut back his role in the US government.Despite BYD's rise in recent years, its sales growth slowed in 2025 to the weakest rate in five years, in part due to fierce competition in China, its key market.Still, BYD remains a global EV powerhouse as its prices often undercut rival carmakers.The Shenzhen-based company's rapid expansion - especially in Latin America, South East Asia and parts of Europe - comes despite many countries imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EVs.In October, BYD said the UK had become its biggest market outside China. The firm said that its sales in Britain surged by 880% in the year to the end of September, driven by strong demand for the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U sports utility vehicle (SUV).",

    "body": "Indian families grieve deaths caused by contaminated tap water 3 hours agoSameer Khan,IndoreandAbhishek Dey,DelhiSameer KhanMore than 200 people are admitted in hospitals in IndoreSunil Sahu bitterly regrets the day his five-month-old son was given some cow milk diluted with tap water.Avyan was being breast-fed but his father says the family - who live in Indore city in India's central Madhya Pradesh state - gave him the diluted mixture in addition.In many Indian families, cow's milk is believed to be too thick for infants and capable of upsetting their digestion, leading caregivers to dilute it.Aware that tap water is unsafe to drink, the family said they boiled the milk–water mixture and allowed it to cool before feeding Avyan.The infant started suffering from diarrhoea on 26 December. Despite being treated by a local doctor, the child died within three days. Mr Sahu alleges that the tap water killed his son.Avyan is among several people suspected to have died after drinking contaminated water in Indore's Bhagirathpura neighbourhood. Investigations are still going on but officials say that a pipeline leak led to sewage mixing with drinking water, leading to a diarrhoea outbreak in the area.The exact death toll remains unclear. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav said postmortem reports have so far confirmed four deaths linked to contaminated drinking water.But the number is likely to increase. While state minister Kailash Vijayvargiya says he has heard about eight deaths so far, local journalists told BBC Hindi that the toll is close to 14. More than 200 people have been admitted to hospitals in the city.Over the past week, around 40,000 residents of Bhagirathpura - a neighbourhood of largely poor and lower-middle income families - were screened by health authorities and around 2,450 cases of vomiting and diarrhoea were identified, said the government.The deaths in Indore - often ranked India's cleanest city - have sparked an uproar and put the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive.District Magistrate Shivam Verma said the leak that caused the contamination has been fixed and officials are checking for others. One municipal officer has been dismissed and two suspended.\"It should not have happened in the first place. We have set up a committee to investigate the matter, and no stone will be left unturned to make sure that it does not happen again,\" Chief Minister Yadav told the media. The local municipal corporation is currently supplying water to Bhagirathpura through tankers. Residents say they have been told not to use tap water until further notice.Sameer KhanNandalal Pal (left) and Seema Prajapat (right) are among the victimsWhile government teams conduct inspection drives in Bhagirathpura, families are grieving.Sanjay Yadav, a tailor, says his 69-year-old mother started vomiting on the evening of 26 December. \"We took her to a hospital, but she died in less than 24 hours,\" said Mr Yadav, whose 11-month-old son is also unwell.His neighbour Sudha Pal's 76-year-old father Nandalal Pal also died after a bout of severe diarrhoea. \"The tap water in our house is still contaminated and it stinks,\" she says.\"The water smelt foul, but we never thought it could kill someone,\" said Arun Prajapat, who alleges that his mother Seema died after consuming the contaminated water.According to media reports, residents of Bhagirathpura had complained about the foul-smelling and contaminated water for more than two months before the diarrhoea outbreak.When asked about this, local councillor Kamal Waghela of the BJP told news agency ANI on Thursday that Indore's sewage and water pipelines need a lot of repairs and that work had been progressing in most areas. Jitu Patwari of the opposition Congress, however, accused the BJP government of misgovernance and hiding the actual number of deaths.\"Indore has consistently given votes to the BJP but they have given poisoned water instead,\" he told ANI.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBen TobiasWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireAround 40 people have died and 115 people are injured following a fire in a ski resort in south-west Switzerland, police say.Authorities said several nationalities were likely involved in the New Year's Day fire, which happened at 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) in a bar called Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana. It is being treated as a fire and there is \"no question\" of an attack, the region's chief prosecutor said.Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin has called it \"one of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced\". LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fireA helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117Here's what we know so far. What do we know about the victims? REUTERS/Lisa LeutnerAt a news conference on Thursday afternoon police said around 40 people were killed in the fire and 115 people were injured. Around 80-100 of those are in a critical condition, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer told RTL TV on Friday, adding that the death toll could rise. The injured have been transported to hospitals across Switzerland and in other countries.Work is ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, the region's attorney general Beatrice Pilloud said, but officials have warned that it could take days or even weeks to identify the victims. People from several countries are believed to be involved. The Italian foreign ministry says six Italian nationals are currently missing, with 13 others in hospital. The French foreign ministry said eight of its citizens were missing and that it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.French media have reported that at least two of the injured are French nationals.French football club FC Metz said one of its youth players was \"severely burned\" in the fire. Tahirys Dos Santos, 19, has been airlifted to a hospital in Germany for treatment, the club said in a statement.The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.REUTERS/Denis BalibouseWhat caused the fire? The cause is currently unknown but authorities say initial evidence does not suggest an attack.Asked about earlier reports of an explosion, Mr Ganzer said it \"is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises\".Two French nationals who said they were in the bar at the time described seeing a waitress put a birthday candle on top of a champagne bottle. \"One of the candles was held too close to the ceiling, which caught fire. In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood.\" Emma and Albane told French media outlet BFMTV.They described the evacuation as \"very difficult\" because the escape route was \"narrow\" and the stairs to get outside \"even narrower\". 'I hid from a wall of heat': Eyewitnesses describe escapeDisbelief as tragedy hits ski resort on New Year's DayIn a news conference on Thursday, Ms Pilloud did not confirm if the staircases were  narrow, adding that investigations would assess whether they were in line with requirements. She said it was too early to comment on any safety failures.  Video shows moment Swiss bar fire appears to startWhat do we know about Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana? Le Constellation is a large bar in the the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana which has been around for many years. Although the resort itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reported from the resort.Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were likely drinking and dancing. It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts, and it is likely the bar was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating the start of 2026. A promotional video posted on YouTube for Le Constellation bar,  published in May 2024, showed women in motorcycle helmets walking through the bar while carrying sparklers in alcohol bottles above their heads.The caption, written in French, read: \"The Constellation Crans-Montana welcomes you every day from 9am to 2am, 365 days a year without interruption.\"Correction 2 January: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the attorney general said the staircases appeared to be narrow. This was a result of an error in the live broadcast translation of the press conference and the story has since been amended.Police Cantonale ValaisannePolice have released images from inside the bar after the fire showing chairs and benches strewn across the room",

    "body": "40 minutes agoMakuochi Okafor,BBC AfricaandWycliffe MuiaAt least seven people have died and many others are missing after a boat carrying about 200 migrants attempting to reach Europe capsized off the coast of The Gambia, authorities say. The boat overturned on Wednesday midnight near Jinack village in the North Bank Region and it was later found \"grounded on a sandbank\", the country's defence ministry said in a statement. Ninety-six people have been rescued so far and a search is continuing for other passengers who were aboard the shipwrecked vessel that was heading towards Spain's Canary Islands.The perilous journey over the Atlantic Ocean has become an increasingly common route for African migrants trying to reach Europe.Nearly 47,000 people reached the Canary Islands in 2024 and the Spanish non-government organisation Caminando Fronteras estimates more than 9,000 migrants have died trying.After Wednesday's accident, the Gambian Navy launched a search-and-rescue operation, involving several naval vessels and a fishing boat that came to assist, the defence ministry said. The authorities did not say what kind of boat it was but they are typically large wooden canoes not designed for a journey of more than 1,500 km (900 miles) across the Atlantic Ocean. They are often overcrowded. Several of the victims are not Gambian nationals and their identities are still being verified, the defence ministry said.The bodies of seven people have been recovered, while 10 of those rescued are said to be in critical condition and receiving urgent medical care.The Gambia is increasingly being used by West African migrants and asylum seekers as a launchpad for the crossing to Spain's Canary Islands, and then on to mainland Europe.In recent years, the European Union has reached agreements with several North African countries aimed at reducing irregular migration, but this has pushed many migrants to take the longer and more dangerous Atlantic Ocean route.",

    "body": "22 hours agoAna FaguyAdrienne MartinAdrienne Martin faced a difficult choice after her monthly healthcare premium increased dramaticallyAdrienne Martin and her family are starting the New Year off without healthcare. The 47-year-old Texas mother had to make a difficult choice when she found out her monthly healthcare premium was increasing in 2026 from what she described as a manageable $630 (£467) to an unaffordable $2,400 (£1,781). Her husband depends on an IV medication to treat a blood-clotting disease that costs $70,000 a month without insurance. Knowing their benefits would expire, the family stockpiled the drug to survive the first few months of the year. \"It would be like paying two mortgage payments,\" she said of the new monthly price for healthcare. \"We can't pay $30,000 for insurance a year.\"Ms Martin and her family are not the only ones facing this conundrum. Millions of Americans will see their healthcare bills skyrocket when these subsidies, which were provided through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare,  expire.Some members of Congress on both sides of the aisle attempted to extend these subsidies into 2026, but Washington was gridlocked. A vote in the new year could offer hope, but until then, many like Ms Martin will have to live without insurance or see their bills steeply increase.About 24 million Americans buy health insurance through the ACA marketplace, and the majority were used to receiving tax credits to lower the monthly price.Those tax credits, also referred to as subsidies, were first introduced through former President Barack Obama's ACA in 2014. They were then expanded during Covid. The fight to extend the subsidies became the centre of the longest government shutdown in US history, which went on for more than 40 days earlier this year. Democrats wanted to force Republicans to extend the subsidies for an additional three years, which would cost $35bn per year. Republicans did not want the government to foot the bill for another three years of subsidies without spending cuts. The weeks-long shutdown - which left millions without essential government services - ended when a group of Democratic senators agreed to reopen the government, if Republicans in the Senate agreed to vote on extending the subsidies. But that vote still hasn't happened yet, despite efforts from Democrats and four Republicans to put the issue to Congress before the subsidies expired.\"I am pissed for the American people,\" New York Congressman Mike Lawler, a Republican who pushed to save the subsidies, said. \"Everybody has a responsibility to serve their district, to their constituents. You know what is funny? Three-quarters of people on Obamacare are in states Donald Trump won.\"Without the subsidies, the monthly cost of healthcare could rise by 114% on average, according to health research non-profit KFF.Adrienne Martin and Stephanie PetersenAdrienne Martin and Stephanie PetersenMaddie Bannister is among the Americans bracing for that. The California mother, who just had her second child, was paying $124 a month for her family of three in 2025. Now, with a new baby and no ACA subsidies, she is preparing to pay $908 a month. \"So many people are going to choose to be uninsured because it's cheaper to pay a penalty for being uninsured than it is to have healthcare,\" she said. For Ms Bannister's family, the increased cost of healthcare means putting off other spending: \"We were saving for a home, and saving money for that is going to take way longer if we have to spend $11,000 a year on healthcare that we barely use.\"While Ms Bannister is stomaching her new bill, and Ms Martin is going without healthcare, others are resorting to different government programmes to get their coverage. For years, Stephanie Petersen used Medicaid - a healthcare program for lower-income Americans - to get healthcare coverage. Just recently, she was able to switch and get her coverage through the ACA - a welcome change for the 38-year-old. Because her health care is skyrocketing from $75 to $580 a month, she is returning to Medicaid coverage in the New Year.\"I'm trying to stay optimistic but the way things have been going, I'm not hopeful,\" the Illinois resident said. \"Everyone should have affordable, good healthcare, and not have to jump through all these hoops.\"A vote on the three-year extension of the ACA subsidies is now expected the week of 5 January when Congress returns to Washington. Until then, Ms Martin will be one of the more than 27 million Americans without health insurance in 2026. A number that is likely to grow, experts warn, as healthcare costs increase. \"We're not low-income people, we make decent money, but we can't afford $30,000 a year for insurance, that's crazy,\" she said.\"We've done everything we're supposed to do, we've worked our whole lives, we work hard, and we just get screwed. The whole system is a nightmare.\"",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump says he is in \"perfect\" health, takes more aspirin than doctors recommend, uses makeup to cover bruising on his hands, and does not get regular exercise because he finds it \"boring\".In a lengthy interview about his health, Trump also told The Wall Street Journal that he underwent a CT scan in October, after incorrectly telling reporters that he had undergone a more detailed MRI scan.Trump, 79, is the oldest president inaugurated in US history and his ageing has come under increased scrutiny. He denied to the Journal that he has struggled to hear or that he has fallen asleep at recent White House events. The newspaper said Trump \"expressed irritation about the public debate over his health\".\"Let's talk about health again for the 25th time,\" the president said at the start of an \"impromptu phone call\" as the newspaper prepared to publish a story about his health. Trump said he had been taking larger than recommended doses of aspirin for the last 25 years, even as he said it caused him to bruise easily.\"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,\" Trump said. He takes 325mg of aspirin per day, rather than the 81mg dose sometimes recommended by doctors. \"They'd rather have me take the smaller one,\" Trump said. But he does not want to switch routines after so many years. \"I'm a little superstitious,\" he said. According to guidance from the Mayo Clinic, the risk of heart attack and stroke goes up as you get older and low-dose aspirin helps to prevent both by thinning the blood and preventing clots. But the clinic warns that the risk of bleeding from aspirin also goes up with age. It says the daily dose for aspirin therapy is between 75mg and 325mg.The president also talked about the medical scan he received at Walter Reed National Medical Center, which he previously said was an MRI scan.\"It wasn't an MRI,\" Trump told the Journal. \"It was less than that. It was a scan.\"A doctor for Trump, Navy Capt Sean Barbabella, said in a statement provided to the Journal that Trump had undergone a CT scan, \"to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues\" and that the testing revealed no abnormalities.After Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older people, he was advised to wear compression socks but he declined. \"I didn't like them,\" Trump said, adding that he now gets up from his desk more regularly, which has improved swelling in his legs. Still, the president said he preferred not to do any form of regular exercise, other than golfing.\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"The president maintained that he had not nodded off during public meetings, saying he closed his eyes at times because he finds it \"relaxing\". As for the bruising seen on his hands in some photos, Trump said he now carried makeup in case his hand got \"whacked\".\"I have makeup that's, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds,\" he said.Trump said he did not have trouble with his hearing, and when photographers have taken photos of him when he appears to be sleeping, he said \"sometimes they'll take a picture of me blinking\".\"And they'll catch me with the blink.\"Barbabella said in the statement to the Journal that Trump was in \"exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as Commander in Chief\".Trump's predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, dropped out of the 2024 election race after a stumbling debate with Trump raised questions about his age and mental sharpness.",

    "body": "1 day agoLaura Gozzi,KyivandJames ChaterUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a peace agreement to end the war with Russia is \"90% ready\", in a New Year address that largely focused on resistance to Moscow's full-scale invasion.Zelensky said the remaining 10% of the agreement to end nearly four years of conflict would \"determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe\".In his own New Year speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his troops that \"we believe in you and our victory\".Earlier on Wednesday, Moscow also released what it said was evidence of Ukraine using drones to target Putin's private home on Lake Valdai in north-west Russia, allegations Kyiv has strenuously denied. It included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot.Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.In his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow secure full control of the industrial area in any peace agreement. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said. At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates. Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".On Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming - and which the alleged drone incident over Putin's residence may have pushed further into the distance.

Rescuers from the National Sea Rescue Institute (NRSI) arrived at the Grootdraai Dam in Mpumalanga on Monday after reports that a boat had suffered motor failure, before drifting to the edge of the dam. The NRSI credited quick-thinking employees who opened sluice gates on the spillway, to stop the boat being swept away by the heavy waterflow. The men were reportedly uninjured.",

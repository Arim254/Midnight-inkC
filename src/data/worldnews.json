    "body": "12 hours agoMengchen Zhang, Jack Lau and Ankur ShahBBC Global China Unit and Eye InvestigationsBBCWarning: This report contains details of physical and sexual abuse and discussion of suicide.Baobao's heart still races when she smells soil after morning rain.It takes her back to early military drills behind locked gates - and the constant fear that marked every one of her days at Lizheng Quality Education School.For six months, aged 14, she barely left the red and white building in a remote Chinese village where instructors tried to \"fix\" young people whose families considered them rebellious or problematic.Students who failed to comply were beaten so severely they could not sleep on their backs or sit down for days, she says.\"Every single moment was agonising,\" says Baobao, now 19 and speaking under a pseudonym for fear of retribution.She says she considered suicide, and knows other students who attempted it.'Raped and beaten'A BBC Eye investigation has uncovered multiple allegations of physical abuse in the school and others in the same network, and cases of young people being abducted and taken to the institutions.Corporal punishment has been banned in China for decades, but we have collated testimony from 23 former students who say they were beaten or forced to do extreme amounts of exercise. One says she was raped, and two others, including Baobao, say they were sexually assaulted or harassed, all by instructors.Undercover filming has exposed how staff pose as authorities to forcibly transfer young people to their institutions.Thirteen students say they were abducted, with parental consent, by employees pretending to be police or officials.The accounts - from interviews by the BBC World Service, statements gathered by activists, police reports and state media - relate to five schools. These are part of a network of at least 10 schools, all of which have been run by - or have close links to - a military veteran called Li Zheng.Baobao says every single moment at the school was \"agonising\"The centres are part of a booming industry promising anxious parents that military-style discipline will resolve concerns over young people's disobedience, internet addiction, teenage dating and depression, as well as gender and sexual identity. Some parents even send over-18s, who are legally adults.A series of abuse allegations have made headlines in China in recent years, in both Li Zheng schools and others.In a few cases, arrests have been made or institutions shut down, but schools can be quick to reopen with different names or in different locations because the sector has been difficult to regulate. The BBC understands that Mr Li was arrested earlier this year, but we have discovered his associates have recently opened a new school.Companies and individuals involved in the network could either not be reached or declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in the UK told the BBC all educational institutions are required to comply with regulations.'Deeply offensive' body searchBaobao says her mother took her to the Lizheng Quality Education School in Hunan province when she began skipping classes, triggering rows which made their already difficult relationship worse.Her mother left while she was being shown around the school, she says, and she then realised she was not allowed to leave: \"They said if I behaved well, I might be able to get out.\"Baobao initially tried to kick and punch the instructors, she says, but decided to comply when they tried to restrain her with her own shoelaces. Later, she was searched. She describes the way this was done as sexual assault. \"I found it deeply offensive… she touched all my sensitive areas.\"She says her mother paid about 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months at the institution, and she was not given any academic lessons. Few disciplinary schools offer these, and some that do charge extra for them.The school is still operating, now known as Quality Education for Teenagers, with around 300 students, aged eight to 18.Undercover footage was filmed there earlier this year by a woman posing as a parent considering enrolling her fictional 15-year-old son. She said he was smoking, dating and driving her car.She was shown locked gates on staircases, metal grilles along open-air corridors and CCTV monitoring dormitories where children rest, get changed and shower.Filmed undercover, a staff member says Quality Education for Teenagers uses a \"white lie\" when it takes students to the schoolA staff member told her it would take at least six months to improve the teenager's behaviour, but under a \"three-year warranty\" she could send him back paying for just food and accommodation if he reverted to his old ways.She was told not to tell him about the new school. \"When we arrange pick-ups, we tell a white lie,\" the staff member said.She explained instructors impersonating officials from the \"internet regulator\" would say they needed him to help with an investigation, and take him to the centre. \"If this fails, several instructors will simply restrain him and carry him to the vehicle,\" she said.Another former student, Zhang Enxu, now aged 20, says she had a similar experience when she was taken to a different school in the network.Then 19, she had left home, frustrated with her parents' refusal to accept her transgender identity and her decision to live as a woman - she was registered male at birth. She says she had returned for a family visit to her grandmother's grave, when three men claiming to be police appeared, saying her details had been used in fraud.\"They forcibly dragged me into the car. My parents stood by as I was taken away,\" she says.Enxu says she was beaten and raped at the disciplinary school she was taken to at the age of 19She was taken to Shengbo Youth Psychological Growth Training School in Hunan where she says she was beaten, leaving her with hearing loss in one ear, and later raped.In the undercover footage from the school Baobao attended, a staff member says there are no beatings: \"We change the behaviour of youngsters with military training and counselling.\"But Baobao and Enxu describe a very different experience.\"Corporal punishment is ever-present,\" says Baobao. \"If your dance routines or military boxing lack precision, or are poorly executed, you will be punished.\"She said the instructors would use a pipe, raising it overhead before \"bringing it down with force\" on her classmates. \"Where they hit you would turn black. You get severe bruising.\"Videos obtained and verified by the BBC, that were filmed at another of Li Zheng's schools, show instructors raising a rod high and striking students' hands.Enxu says the students were forced to do \"enormous\" amounts of physical training. She said instructions to carry out exercises like push-ups \"might start at a thousand repetitions\".She also says she was attacked in her dormitory by an instructor on night duty: \"He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the floor, then he sexually assaulted me.\"Enxu's parents were sent videos of her at the school taking part in drills and counselling sessionsBaobao says she considered trying to kill herself, but realised she would be caught in the hours it would take her to die.She says one of her classmates did attempt to take her own life, but instead of taking her to hospital, the instructors tried to flush her stomach themselves.Both Baobao and Enxu describe counselling sessions where little understanding was shown.Enxu's sessions were videoed for her parents, who she says had paid 65,800 yuan ($9,300, £7,000) for six months. \"Be a happy, healthy, positive boy. All right?\" she is urged. \"You're a boy, do what boys do… just be happy.\"Baobao says that when she told the counsellor she wanted to end her life, the response was: \"If you were going to die, you wouldn't be sitting here in front of me.\"\"Is that something a caring person would say? Are they even human?\" she asks.Both students wondered how their parents could have decided to subject them to the experience.Enxu's mother wept as she told the BBC the family had been \"deceived\" by the school's promises: \"Not only did you swindle someone out of their money, but you also tore their family apart, causing a breakdown in their relationship.\"Footage obtained by the BBC that was filmed at one of Li Zheng's schools shows an instructor hitting a student on the handSocial pressure to have academically successful children plays a major role in parents' decisions - particularly among urban middle-class families - to send their children to disciplinary schools, says Dr Yichen Rao, an anthropologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.He has studied internet addiction centres for young people in China, and says lack of support in the school system, anxiety, and conflict within the family can combine to make parents \"feel that they have no other choices\".Baobao's mother declined to comment. Her daughter says she can now \"understand both sides\": \"I think she was brainwashed by the slogans used to sell the school. She was desperate for me to become more obedient… to be the daughter she always wanted.\"Baobao managed to leave after feigning an eye problem. Her mother simply said \"let's turn the page\", leaving her angry and confused, she recalls.Viral lettersEnxu's ordeal ended after a month. Her friends realised she was missing and contacted the police, who then located her and shared a video of her at the school. Her friend Wang Yuhang identified the school by asking in online groups about the green uniform she was wearing.Enxu discreetly documented her experience in letters that were smuggled out and posted online. They went viral and as public pressure grew, the police intervened and she was allowed to leave.Twelve days later, authorities announced Shengbo school was closing, but made no reference to the abuse Enxu alleged, saying, however, that the school had violated administrative regulations.She says the police later told her Li Zheng had been arrested, accused of involvement in organised crime. The police did not respond to BBC requests for information about Enxu's case and Mr Li. The local education department have also not responded.Secret filmingUndercover footage shows students doing military-style drills at a new school set up by former employees of Li Zheng schoolsMr Li keeps a relatively low public profile. The BBC has analysed his network and found it operates disciplinary schools across four provinces through a complex set of companies registered to him or his close associates.He founded his first centre in 2006 and has owned four different education companies at different times.The website of one of his organisations says he is a graduate of a Chinese Air Force academy in southern China, and worked as a \"director of training\" and \"senior psychological counsellor\" at several schools from 2007.On local television in Hunan province, he once spoke about nurturing young people with \"love and patience\".Chinese authorities have intervened before, following allegations about schools in the network.An instructor at a different Li Zheng school was detained by police in 2019 after allegations he had beaten students with water pipes.Also, according to Chinese media reports, the school Baobao attended was ordered to stop admissions after a student suicide in 2020. She was there at the time and says it continued to operate over that period. It changed its name soon afterwards.Mu Zhou, an Australia-based volunteer who has been helping document allegations of abuse, says \"whenever there's public outcry, he [Li Zheng] would alter the name or change the legal representative\". He also says students are bussed between different sites to avoid inspections.'Huge profits'Two undercover researchers recently visited what may be the latest addition to the Li Zheng network.Posing as investors in the Hong Kong education sector, the researchers set up a meeting with three former employees of Li Zheng schools, in a new school they have set up in Fujian.\"The profits in this industry are huge,\" Li Yunfeng, the director of counselling at the new school, told them. He outlined how the business model could work in Hong Kong, suggesting fees of at least $25,000 (£19,000) per student annually.He declined to disclose the name of their boss, but said he was \"a veteran\".He appeared to distance himself from the network, however, telling the undercover researchers: \"There were some incidents. The parents lodged a complaint. The group... though not formally dissolved yet, it's teetering on the brink of collapse. That's why I stepped out.\"Secret filmingLi Yunfeng told undercover researchers the previous group was \"on the brink of collapse\" but he is helping open a new schoolThe BBC was not able to reach Li Zheng, Li Yunfeng and other schools and companies linked to Li Zheng and his associates for comment, despite multiple attempts.The staff member who provided a tour of the Quality Education for Teenagers school declined to comment. The education department which oversees the school could not be reached, despite multiple attempts.Regulating these disciplinary centres is difficult. Some are not registered as schools. The responsibility is split between local education, civil affairs and market regulation authorities, a Chinese lawyer familiar with lawsuits against such institutions, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC.Dr Rao says that with no centralised regulation over the disciplinary schools, the responsibility tends to fall to local government.He describes it as a \"shadowy industry that the state just tolerates\", adding that the state may not wish to give it legitimacy by providing regulation or guidelines.But, he adds, there is a \"spectrum\" of schools, with some incorporating psychotherapy for students and training for parents, or disciplining staff who carry out corporal punishment.The Chinese embassy in London said the government \"attaches great importance to the lawful operation of educational institutions and the protection of minors\". It says all educational institutions \"are required to comply with relevant laws and regulations\".'Terribly sad'Enxu and her friend Wang want to see all disciplinary schools shut down. They work to gather video evidence of abuse and abduction, believing this is crucial to get the police to investigate, sometimes posting it online.Wang often receives requests from students. He has helped with the logistics of escape attempts and by pressuring schools to allow students to leave.Baobao never returned to education, which she says makes her feel \"terribly sad\". She now makes a living through online streaming and gaming, but believes she might have gone to university if she had not been sent to the Lizheng Quality Education School.\"These schools are essentially scams,\" she says.\"The prevailing educational ethos is one of violence begetting violence… the very concept is fundamentally flawed,\" she says, adding that they \"simply shouldn't exist\".Details of organisations offering information and support with mental health, distress or despair, or sexual abuse or violence, are available at BBC ActionLine.Additional reporting by Alex Mattholie and Shanshan Chen",

    "body": "2 hours agoDipali Jagtap and Cherylann MollanGlobal fashion brand Prada has announced a line of limited-edition footwear inspired by Indian-made Kolhapuri sandals, months after it faced backlash for allegedly appropriating the sandal's design.The Italian luxury brand will make 2,000 pairs of sandals in India's Maharashtra and Karnataka states, under a deal with two state-backed entities, Reuters news agency reports.\"We'll mix the original manufacturer's standard capabilities with our manufacturing techniques\", Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada's head of Corporate Social Responsibility, said.The collection is set to go on sale in February 2026, online and in 40 Prada stores across the world. A pair of sandals are reportedly set to be sold for $939, which amounts to around £800 and 84,000 rupees.The agreement was signed on Thursday during the Italy-India Business Forum 2025.In June, Prada courted controversy after it showcased sandals that had an open-toe braided pattern that closely resembled the traditional Kolhapuri sandals made in Maharashtra and Karnataka.Prada described the sandals as \"leather footwear\" but did not mention its Indian origins, prompting backlash and allegations of cultural appropriation in India.The brand later acknowledged the footwear design's Indian roots.A Prada spokesperson at that time told the BBC that the company has \"always celebrated craftsmanship, heritage and design traditions\", adding that it was \"in contact with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture on this topic\". This is a prominent industry trade body in the state.On Friday, Maharashtra's Social Justice Minister Sanjay Shirsat told BBC Marathi that the new initiative will be called 'Prada Made in India – Inspired by Kolhapuri Chappals [sandals]'.\"Keeping in mind Prada's requirements and demand, some artisans will receive special training from Prada and LIDCOM [a state-backed entity supporting the leather industry in Maharashtra]. Additionally, around 200 Kolhapuri chappal artisans will be given three years of training in Italy,\" he said.Mr Shirsat said the agreement had been signed for five years, but expressed confidence that it would be extended further. \"The state government will also provide financial assistance to the artisans for this purpose,\" he added. Named after a city in Maharashtra where they are made, Kolhapuri sandals trace their roots back to the 12th Century.Made from leather and sometimes dyed in natural colours, the traditional handcrafted sandals are sturdy and well-suited to India's hot climate.Following the controversy, many artisans in Kolhapur said they were saddened by Prada's use of the design without giving due credit.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPeter Hoskins,Business reporterandLily Jamali,North America technology correspondentUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at blocking states from enforcing their own artificial intelligence (AI) regulations.\"We want to have one central source of approval,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday.It will give the Trump administration tools to push back on the most \"onerous\" state rules, said White House AI adviser David Sacks. The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added.The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry.AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, with firms pouring billions of dollars into the technology.The BBC has contacted AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic for comment.But the announcement has been met with opposition. The state of California, which is the home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, already has its own AI regulations.California's Governor Gavin Newsom, who is a vocal critic of Trump, issued a strongly-worded statement in response to the executive order, accusing him of corruption.\"Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology.\"Earlier this year, Newsom signed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit risks stemming from their AI models.States including Colorado and New York have also passed laws regulating the development of the technology.Newsom has said the law sets a standard that US lawmakers could follow. Other critics of Trump's executive order argue that state laws are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level.\"Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,\" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement.But having individual states craft their own laws has created a patchwork of rules that can be harmful to the American AI industry, said Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School.\"It would be better to have one federal law than a bunch of conflicting state laws. However, that assumes that we will have a good federal law in place,\" he told the BBC.The tech lobby group NetChoice celebrated the executive order on Thursday. \"We look forward to working with the White House and Congress to set nationwide standards and a clear rulebook for innovators,\" said its director of policy Patrick Hedger.",

    "body": "Famous crocodile wrangler jailed for evidence tampering5 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesMatt Wright's lawyers say he intends to appeal the verdictsCelebrity crocodile wrangler Matt Wright will spend five months in prison for tampering with evidence after a helicopter crash that killed his co-star and left the pilot a paraplegic.In August, the former Netflix star was found guilty of lying to police and pressuring a hospitalised witness after the 2022 crash in the Northern Territory (NT). On Friday, Acting Justice Alan Blow handed Wright a 10-month prison term, which will be suspended after he has served half of it. He was also fined A$5,000 ($3,300; £2,500).Justice Blow said Wright had \"shown no remorse\" but was \"very unlikely to reoffend in any significant way in the future.\"The maximum sentence for his charges was 15 years in prison.The jury could not agree on a verdict for a third charge that alleged Wright asked someone to \"torch\" evidence.Wright's lawyers indicated previously that they planned to appeal the guilty verdicts.The judge pointed to mitigating factors in deciding the length of his jail term, like his contribution to the community and character references that were the \"most impressive I've ever seen\". The NT Supreme Court case centred around a helicopter crash in February 2022 in Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin.Wright's friend and Outback Wrangler co-star Chris \"Willow\" Wilson - suspended from the chopper in a sling during a crocodile egg harvesting trip - was killed.The pilot Sebastian Robinson was seriously injured, suffering punctured lungs and a severe brain injury.Wright, who was not in the helicopter, was one of the first people to arrive at the crash site.During the month-long trial, prosecutors told the court that Wright had lied to police about how much fuel was in the helicopter's tank when it plummeted to the ground. The evidence included secret recordings of Wright's conversations which, the prosecution said, contradicted his claims that the fuel tank was half full when asked in police interviews.Wright was also accused of going to the hospital bedside of Mr Robinson - who had been told by doctors he may never walk again - and asking him to change flight records that showed how many hours the aircraft had flown.Prosecutors argued this was because Wright was worried that investigators would find out he regularly changed the official flying hours of a chopper to avoid costly maintenance.The jury delivered unanimous verdicts for both the charges. A third charge related to Wright asking a friend to \"torch\" the helicopter's maintenance record. The jury was deadlocked on the third charge and unable to return a verdict. It remains under consideration by the courts.The case does not relate to the cause of the crash, the death of Mr Wilson and Mr Robinson's injuries.CareFlightThe site of the 2022 crash in Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin.False flight records was the normThe trial exposed the inner workings of the NT's helicopter community with revelations that it was common practice to \"pop the clock\" by disconnecting a meter that records flight hours in order to delay maintenance requirements.The prosecution argued that falsifying flight records was rampant across the industry and Wright was worried his involvement in this practice would be blamed for the crash. Wright's defence lawyer accepted that under reporting of flight hours was \"widespread throughout the NT's helicopter community,\" but argued Wright had not perverted the course of justice when he tried to cover up the doctored records.During the trial, the jury heard how Wright visited Mr Robinson several times while he was in hospital. Wright, the prosecution claimed, was there to put \"the hard word\" on the injured pilot, asking Mr Robinson to transfer flight hours from the crashed aircraft to another helicopter.During cross-examination, Mr Robinson denied being a \"raging cocaine junkie\" after another witness - a fellow helicopter pilot - described him as a \"party animal\".The court heard that a blood sample from Mr Robinson showed traces of cocaine but below the \"prescribed amount for enforcement\" under aviation rules, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).Mr Robinson also told the court he had no memory of the crash but conceded that he \"must have intentionally disconnected\" Wilson's sling as it was best practice in an emergency to release the collector. Investigators concluded that Wilson died after falling 25m to the ground. 'Everyone looked at Matt as an idol'Wright is best known globally as the star of National Geographic's Outback Wrangler and Netflix's Wild Croc Territory reality shows. He also owns several local tourism businesses and has been a tourism ambassador for Australia.During the trial, Mr Robinson told the court how people who worked for Wright revered him.\"Absolutely, everyone looked at Matt as an idol and if he said 'jump' they'd say 'how high',\"  Mr Robinson said, adding \"everyone wanted to be around him, work for him\".\"We were young men, we looked up to him and we wanted to do our best to make ourselves look good in front of him and do whatever he said.\"Before the sentencing was handed down, prosecutor Jason Gullaci SC said Wright should serve a term of \"actual immediate imprisonment\" to reflect the \"seriousness\" of his crimes. He described Wright's repeated visits to Mr Robinson in hospital to request records be manipulated as significantly more serious than lying about the fuel as it was \"considered, planned and all directed at achieving the result of obstructing the course of justice\".Wright's lawyer David Edwardson KC requested that the judge not sentence his client based on his \"celebrity status\" and that Wright's estimation about the chopper's fuel level was \"done to protect a mate\".",

    "body": "Russia could attack Nato within five years, says alliance chief in stark new warning17 hours agoFrank Gardner,Security CorrespondentandPaulin KolaRussia could attack a Nato country within the next five years, the Western military alliance's chief has said in a stark new warning. \"Russia is already escalating its covert campaign against our societies,\"  Mark Rutte said in a speech in Germany. \"We must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured.\"He echoed similar statements about Russia's intentions made by Western intelligence agencies, which Moscow dismisses as hysteria.Rutte's warning comes as US President Donald Trump tries to bring an end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022. Earlier this month, Russia's President Vladimir Putin said his country was not planning to go to war with Europe, but it was ready \"right now\" if Europe wanted to - or started a war. But similar reassurances were given by Moscow in 2022, just before 200,000 Russian troops crossed the border and invaded Ukraine.Putin has accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine - a reference to the role Ukraine's European allies have recently played in trying to change a US peace plan to end the war, whose initial draft was seen as favouring Russia.But Putin was not sincere, Nato's secretary-general said in the German capital, Berlin.Supporting Ukraine, he added, was a guarantee for European security.\"Just imagine if Putin got his way; Ukraine under the boot of Russian occupation, his forces pressing against a longer border with Nato, and the significantly increased risk of an armed attack against us.\"Russia's economy has been on a war footing for more than three years now - its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells.According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point.Analysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.France and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds.So-called \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries, has been ramping up this year.But worrying as these events are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Nato includes 30 European countries - as well as Canada and the US, the alliance's most powerful military member.Under pressure from Trump, its members have pledged to increase military spending.\"Nato's own defences can hold for now,\" Rutte warned in Berlin, but conflict was \"next door\" to Europe and he feared \"too many are quietly complacent, and too many don't feel the urgency, too many believe that time is on our side. \"Allied defence spending and production must rise rapidly, our armed forces must have what they need to keep us safe,\" the Nato chief said.",

    "body": "12 hours agoNavin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World ServiceOrangutan Information CentreThe Tapanuli orangutan was only discovered by scientists to be a separate species in 2017 – distinct from the Sumatran and Bornean apesAn unusual silence in the forests of north Sumatra in Indonesia is worrying wildlife experts and conservationists. Here, in the mountainous forests of Batang Toru, is where they had always seen and heard the world's rarest ape, the Tapanuli orangutans.But ever since Cyclone Senyar devastated Sumatra on 25 November, the critically endangered primates have not been seen in the area, conservation workers say.Their absence has fuelled speculation as to whether the great apes were swept away by floods and landslides. And while some believe the animals may have travelled to a safer location, a carcass found in the area, said to be that of an orangutan, is fuelling conservationists' fears.Fewer than 800 Tapanuli orangutans remain and any loss would have a serious impact on the species, conservationists say.Humanitarian workers told the BBC they found the dead animal semi-buried in the debris of mud and logs in Pulo Pakkat village in central Tapanuli district earlier this week.\"When I first saw it I was not sure what it was, because it was kind of defaced, perhaps because it was buried underneath by the sludge and logs,\" said Deckey Chandra, who has been working with a humanitarian team in the area. He previously worked in the conservation of the Tapanuli orangutans.\"I have seen several dead bodies of humans in the past few days but this was the first dead wildlife,\" he said. \"They used to come to this place to eat fruits. But now it seems to have become their graveyard.\"Getty ImagesCyclone Senyar swept across Sumatra in late November, devastating the Indonesian islandMr Chandra shared with the BBC pictures he took of the carcass, some of which show him with the dead animal.Conservationists working in the region believe it is of the Tapanuli orangutan, a species that was only discovered in 2017. The other two species are Bornean and Sumatran orangutans.More than 900 people have died as a result of heavy rain, floods and landslides since Cyclone Senyar ravaged parts of Indonesia in late November. Hundreds are still missing, with many villages in Sumatra completely destroyed as the storm swept across the island.Professor Erik Meijaard, managing director of Borneo Futures in Brunei, is now studying the disasters' impact on the orangutans with the help of satellite images.He said 4,800 hectares (11,860 acres)  of forest on the mountain slopes can be seen as destroyed by landslides - but since part of the satellite image is cloud covered, he's extrapolated the destruction figure to 7,200 hectares in his preliminary observation.\"The destroyed areas would have contained some 35 orangutans, and considering the violence of the destruction it wouldn't surprise us if they are all dead. That's a major blow to the population,\" he told the BBC.\"These areas show as bare soil on satellite imagery where two weeks ago it was primary forest. Complete destruction. Many patches of several hectares completely denuded. It must have been hellish in the forest at the time.\"Prof Mejjard said he too has seen the picture of the dead orangutan shared by Chandra.\"What struck me is that all the flesh had been ripped off the face,\" he said. \"If a few hectares of forest comes down in massive landslides, even powerful orangutans are helpless and just get mangled.\"Panut Hadisiswoyo, founder of Orangutan Information Centre which works for the conservation of the primates in the region, said the carcass meant it was highly possible some Tapanuli orangutans were unable to escape as rushing waters and landslides swept through their habitat.Getty ImagesExperts suggest that as much as 7,200 hectares of forest was destroyed in the recent cyclonePictures showing the carcass of a Sumatran elephant, another critically endangered species, being swept away by floods in Aceh in northern Sumatra went viral on social media last week.The island hosts a range of endangered species like Sumatran tigers, elephants and rhinos.But conservation workers say there are particular concerns for orangutans and other primates, like gibbons, because huge parts of the mountainous forest in the Tapanuli district saw massive landslides due to Cyclone Senyar's extreme rainfall.Some locals say the primates must have escaped before the disaster struck, as they can sense danger beforehand. But some primate experts say that may not have been the case.\"During heavy rains orangutans either just sit in a tree or gather branches and leaves to use as an umbrella and then wait for the rain to stop,\" said Serge Wich, professor of primate biology at Liverpool John Moores University, who has conducted research on Tapanuli orangutans.\"But this time, by the time the rain stopped it was too late: parts of their habitat - the slopes of valleys - were wiped out by landslides, which means there must have been consequences for them.\"The recent floods have also damaged a number of orangutan research centres in Sumatra - including at Ketambe, the world's first orangutan research centre, in Aceh.Dr Ian Singleton, scientific director for the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme, said the Ketambe centre is now almost completely destroyed. \"It needs to be rebuilt as soon as possible so it can continue to play that role in protecting the forests in that area and its orangutans.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoKelly NgandThanyarat Doksone,BangkokThailand has dissolved parliament after nearly a week of fresh clashes along its border with Cambodia, with a general election to be called within 45 to 60 days.In a royal decree published on Friday, Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul cited the deadly border dispute among other challenges his minority government has struggled to contain since it took office three months ago.\"The appropriate solution is to dissolve parliament… which is a way to return political power to the people,\" he said.Anutin, a business tycoon, is Thailand's third prime minister since August 2023. When he took power in September, he said he would dissolve parliament by the end of January.However, now facing an imminent vote of no confidence, Anutin brought the election forward.Anutin and his Bhumjaithai party were heavily criticised for their handling of serious flooding in southern Thailand last month, which left at least 176 people dead. The house's dissolution comes during renewed fighting with Cambodia, which has killed at least 20 people and displaced hundreds of thousands.\"The government had executed every means in public administration to quickly resolve the urgent issues overwhelming the country… but running the country requires stability,\" Anutin wrote in the decree endorsed by Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn. \"As a minority government, together with troubling domestic political circumstances, it has been unable to carry out public administration continuously, effectively and with stability,\" he wrote.The dissolution order comes after the prime minister lost the support of the youthful, progressive People's Party - also the largest party in parliament - which had previously backed his premiership.The People's Party and the pragmatic, conservative Bhumjaithai are ideological opposites. The opposition bloc's support, however, came with strings attached. It wanted Anutin to start reforms of Thailand's military-drafted constitution and to dissolve the house within four months, among other things.The People's Party has now accused Bhumjaithai of failing to honour that deal. It had planned to submit a no-confidence motion against the government on Friday, according to Thai media - having already called on the prime minister on Thursday to disband parliament to \"show responsibility towards the people\".\"See you at the polling stations,\" the party said in statement on Facebook.Thailand has been in political turmoil over the past year, with two prime ministers dismissed by the courts. Anutin's predecessor Paetongtarn Shinawatra was removed for violating ethics, after she was heard calling Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen \"uncle\" and criticising the Thai army in a leaked phone call.Srettha Thavisin, the leader before her, was also dismissed for violating ethics, by appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who was once jailed.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head in Bangkok",

    "body": "6 hours agoYang TianReutersNemo made history by becoming the first non-binary performer to win Eurovision in 2024The winner of last year's Eurovision Song Contest, Nemo, has said they are returning their trophy in protest over Israel's continued participation in the event.The 26-year-old Swiss singer said there was a \"clear conflict\" between Israel's involvement in the competition and the ideals of \"unity, inclusion and dignity\" the contest says it stands for.Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said Eurovision was \"saddened\" by the decision and respected Nemo's views.Israel's presence at Eurovision has been an increasing source of tension, because of the war in Gaza and a voting controversy during this year's event.Five countries - Iceland, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands - have announced they will boycott next year's event because Israel has been allowed to compete.Israel has previously called the decision to keep it in the contest a \"victory\" over critics who had tried to silence it and spread hatred.Nemo became the first non-binary performer to lift the Eurovision trophy with their song The Code, which is about the path to realising they were non-binary.After the win, Nemo told the BBC about the challenges they faced during the contest and their feeling that organisers had not done enough to support participants caught up in the row over Israel's inclusion in 2024.\"I felt very alone. I really hope they have things in place for the next year,\" Nemo said at the time. It prompted a series of new measures to be introduced to protect the mental well-being of Eurovision's artists and staff.In a statement posted to Instagram on Thursday, Nemo said they felt the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) decision to allow Israel to still take part in the event no longer aligned with its core values.\"Israel's continued participation, during what the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry has concluded to be a genocide, shows a clear conflict between those ideals and the decision made by the EBU,\" they said, referring to a report released in September.\"Even though I am immensely grateful for the community around this contest and everything this experience has taught me both as a person and artist, today I no longer feel this trophy belongs on my shelf.\"Nemo also posted a video of them placing the trophy in a cardboard box, saying it will be sent back to the EBU's headquarters in Geneva.In a statement sent to BBC News, Martin Green said: \"We're saddened that Nemo wishes to return their trophy which they deservedly won in 2024. \"We respect the deeply held views Nemo has expressed and they will always remain a valued part of the Eurovision family\"EPANemo performing at the 2024 Eurovision in Malmo, SwedenThe boycotts and protests over Israel's inclusion have been the biggest crisis Eurovision has ever seen.This year's competition also had a voting controversy and allegations that Israel's government tried to influence the public vote.This prompted some competition rules to be changed and tightened, after which a \"large majority\" of members agreed there was no need for a further vote on participation and that Eurovision 2026 could proceed as planned, the EBU has said.Israel's President Isaac Herzog has praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it an \"appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation\".Addressing the boycotts, Nemo insisted that their decision to hand back the trophy was not about \"individuals or artists\", but rather what they believed was the use of Eurovision to \"soften the image of a state accused of severe wrongdoing\".\"When entire countries withdraw, it should be clear that something is deeply wrong,\" they added.\"If the values we celebrate on stage aren't lived off stage then even the most beautiful songs become meaningless.\"The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,370 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Next year's Eurovision is due to take place in Vienna, for what is supposed to be a celebratory 70th anniversary edition of the contest.",

    "body": "Reddit has launched a challenge in Australia's highest court against the nation's landmark social media ban for children.The online forum is among 10 social media platforms which must bar Australians aged under 16 from having accounts, under a new law which began on Wednesday.The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms.Reddit is complying with the ban, but in its case will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights. It is the second such legal challenge, with two Australian teens also awaiting a High Court hearing.\"Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark,\" Reddit said in an update on its website.\"There are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth.\"Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats.\"We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she told parliament after news of the first legal challenge broke last month.In that case, which the High Court has agreed to consider at an as-yet undecided date next year, two 15-year-olds from New South Wales are claiming the social media ban is unconstitutional as it infringes \"the implied freedom of communication on governmental and political matters\".\"Democracy doesn't start at 16 as this law says it will,\" Macey Newland told the BBC after their case was filed.The ban, which has excited global leaders and worried tech companies, has also been criticised by some who argue blanket prohibition is neither practical nor wise.Experts fear kids are going to circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.But the policy is wildly popular with parents and has won the support of people like talk show host Oprah Winfrey, and Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.In a statement on their website, the pair lauded the \"bold\" action from Australia but said \"it shouldn't have come to this\".\"We hope this ban is only the start of a reckoning between society and the tech companies that built these platforms with growth as their first principle instead of safety.\"Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.Reddit said the law forces \"intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors\", isolates teens engaging in \"age-appropriate community experiences\" and creates an \"illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't\".\"There are more targeted, privacy-preserving measures to protect young people online without resorting to blanket bans.\"The case is not \"an attempt to avoid compliance\" or \"an effort to retain young users for business reasons\", it added.\"Unlike other platforms included under this law, the vast majority of Redditors are adults, we don't market or target advertising to children under 18,\" it said.The other platforms affected by the ban include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and  TikTok.",

    "body": "13 hours agoMaia DaviesWatch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coastThe US has imposed fresh sanctions on six more ships said to be carrying Venezuelan oil, a day after seizing a tanker off the country's coast.Sanctions have also been placed on some of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's relatives and businesses associated with what Washington calls his illegitimate regime.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the seized vessel, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to an American port. Caracas has described it as an act of \"international piracy\".It marks a sharp escalation in the US pressure campaign against Maduro, which has seen dozens killed in strikes on boats alleged to have been carrying drugs from Venezuela. In recent months American warships have been moving into the region.The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of funnelling narcotics into the US. Venezuela - home to some of the world's largest proven oil reserves - has, in turn, accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources. Maduro vowed on Wednesday that Venezuela would never become an \"oil colony\".But the White House press secretary told reporters on Thursday that the US was committed to both \"stopping the flow of illegal drugs\" into the country and enforcing sanctions.Watch: US actions against Venezuelan tanker are 'criminal' and 'illegal', says MaduroShe would not be drawn on whether the US planned to seize more ships transporting Venezuelan oil.\"We're not going to stand by and watch sanctioned vessels sail the seas with black market oil, the proceeds of which will fuel narco-terrorism of rogue and illegitimate regimes around the world,\" Leavitt said. She added that the US planned to seize the oil on board the Skipper, after the necessary legal process.Leavitt also said Trump would not be concerned \"at all\" to hear Russian President Vladimir Putin had called Maduro earlier in the day to offer Moscow's support \"in the face of growing external pressure\".US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later said that imposing sanctions on three nephews of Maduro's wife, alongside a number of businesses and ships, would tackle the leader's \"dictatorial and brutal control\".In a post on X, he said the Trump administration was \"holding the regime and its circle of cronies and companies accountable for its continued crimes\".Watch: BBC speaks to Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina MachadoOn Wednesday, the White House released dramatic video footage of the raid that showed camouflaged soldiers dropping down on to the Skipper from a helicopter, and walking its deck, weapons drawn.The Venezuelan government strongly denounced the seizure, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.\"They have ushered in a new era,\" the Venezuelan president said in a speech on Thursday. \"The era of criminal naval piracy in the Caribbean.\"Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello called the US \"murderers, thieves, pirates\" and added that this was how the country had \"started wars all over the world\".Planet Labs via ReutersSatellite imagery picked up the Skipper docked alongside another vessel off Port Jose, Venezuela on 18 NovemberThe US treasury department sanctioned the Skipper vessel in 2022, CBS reported, for alleged involvement in oil smuggling that generated revenue for Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.The US had ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the days before the raid.It involved thousands of troops and USS Gerald Ford - the world's largest aircraft carrier - being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.",

    "body": "Some 200 West African soldiers, mainly from Nigeria and Ivory Coast, are in Benin to support the government following Sunday's failed coup, Benin's foreign minister says.The attempt was foiled after Nigeria deployed fighter jets to drive the mutineers out of a military base and state TV headquarters, where they had declared a takeover.This is the first time that officials have said how many foreign soldiers were deployed to the country, although it is not clear if some have been withdrawn since Sunday.Benin's Foreign Affairs Minister Olushegun Adjadi Bakari on Thursday said some of the regional troops sent to help had remained in the country \"as part of the sweep and clean-up operation\". A manhunt for those involved in the plot is under way, with the leader of the failed coup said to be taking refuge in neighbouring Togo.The rebel soldiers justified their actions by criticising President Patrice Talon's management of the country, complaining first about his handling of the \"continuing deterioration of the security situation in northern Benin\".The West African regional bloc, Ecowas, deployed troops from Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast to secure key installations and prevent any resurgence of the violence.Nigeria, Benin's large neighbour to the east, said its soldiers had reached there on Sunday, describing the coup attempt as a \"direct assault on democracy\".An Ivory Coast security source told AFP news agency that 50 soldiers from the country had been sent as part of the regional deployment.\"There are currently around 200 soldiers present, who came to lend a hand at the end of the day to the Beninese defence and security forces as part of the sweep and clean-up operation,\" said Bakari, while addressing journalists in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, on Thursday. Bakari, who was speaking alongside Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar, said that by the time the Beninese forces called for help, the coup \"was already a failure\".\"When we started discussions for the intervention of Nigeria and the others, under Ecowas protocol, our military had already pushed them back,\" he added. According to Bakari, what was required was \"precise aerial back-up to carry out a surgical operation that targeted the enemy's key positions without risking civilian casualties\".Tuggar said that fast diplomatic, military, and intelligence actions between Nigeria and Benin had helped to foil the coup.Discussions are continuing over how long the regional forces would remain, but Bakari said any decision \"will be taken in close collaboration with Benin's defence and security forces, who have demonstrated their bravery\". It is not clear if the French special forces who also reportedly helped loyalist troops thwart the coup are still in Benin. Under intense pressure after a string of successful coups in the region, Ecowas is signalling that it is no longer willing to watch democratically elected governments be toppled by the military.Bakari praised Ecowas as \"an important tool that allows us to defend democracy and the values of democracy in our regional space\". Benin's army has suffered losses near its northern border with insurgency-hit Niger and Burkina Faso in recent years, as jihadist militants linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda spread southwards.Talon, who is regarded as a close ally of the West, is due to step down next year after completing his second term in office, with elections scheduled for April.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMaddie Molloy,Climate & Science reporterandStav Danaos,BBC WeatherGetty ImagesThe Geminid meteor shower - one of the most spectacular in the celestial calendar  - is set to peak this weekend and astronomers say conditions could make for an especially striking show if weather permits.The meteors are visible all over the world, though people in the Northern Hemisphere will get the best views.In the UK, if the skies are clear, a waning crescent Moon will only rise after midnight which should mean several hours of dark skies to see the meteors more clearly.Here's the science behind the Geminids and how to get the best chance of seeing them.What is the Geminid meteor shower?Arecibo/NASA/NSFMultiple views of asteroid 3200 Phaethon - the source of the Geminids meteor showerWe get treated to meteor showers when Earth passes through the trails of comets - icy objects which Nasa calls 'cosmic snowballs' - or in rarer cases, including the Geminids, asteroids, which are rocky.When dust and gases from these objects enter our atmosphere, they burn up and create the bright streaks we know as shooting stars.While most meteors appear white, some can glow green, yellow, red, or blue, depending on the elements in the material as it burns up in Earth's atmosphere.Metals such as sodium, magnesium, and calcium produce colours similar to those seen in fireworks.The Geminids shower comes from the remnants of an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon.Until recently, scientists thought the Geminids were a result of dust escaping from 3200 Phaethon. But two years ago  scientists revealed that Phaethon's tail is actually made of glowing sodium gas. So there is still some uncertainty about how and when the Geminids dust was formed.The Geminids offer one of the year's best chances, weather-permitting, of seeing a shower, due to the volume and frequency of its 'shooting stars'.\"What you'd be looking at in a nice dark sky without clouds would be, say, 100 an hour, which is amazing, said Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society.\"It's pretty much the strongest meteor shower of the year.\" Will moonlight spoil the show this year?Getty ImagesBright moonlight can make it more difficult to see meteors and other objects in the night sky. But weather-permitting, we could have close to ideal viewing conditions as the Geminids peak.The crescent Moon is in its final waning phases, with the bulk of it in shadow, and in the UK it also won't rise until the early hours of the morning, potentially giving us a nice dark sky in which to watch the spectacle. Do keep in mind that visibility is still heavily influenced by weather conditions, so check your local forecast for the clearest possible window.Finding somewhere without light pollution and with an open view of the sky will give you the best chance of seeing something.Tips for night-sky enthusiastsThe Geminids are a naked-eye event, best enjoyed under dark, open skies, so you won't need a telescope or binoculars.\"There aren't that many entirely free natural treats. And this is one of them. So go out and enjoy it. You know, it's a way of connecting with the sky, taking a moment to sort of forget our more earthly or more worldly concerns,\" said Dr Massey.The meteors appear to radiate from the constellation of Gemini, but looking slightly away from that point often provides a wider field of view.Dress warmly and take a blanket or reclining chair to get comfortable, and let your eyesight adapt to the dark.\"You just basically need to have reasonable eyesight to see this and I think that is incredible.\"What will the weather be like for the Geminids peak?The Geminids meteor shower peaks on Sunday 14 December.Unfortunately, the weather in the UK isn't looking ideal for viewing. Both Saturday and Sunday are expected to be windy and cloudy, with outbreaks of rain during the day and night.On Sunday night, there may be a few drier, clearer spells. Northern Scotland and the Northern Isles, as well as parts of East Anglia and southeast England, are likely to have the best chances of catching a glimpse of the night sky. But keep on checking in as there may be gaps in the gloom. A good place to keep track of the potential for a good viewing in your area is The Met Office's UK Cloud Cover Map. ",

Her family is still displaced after the war and waiting for reconstruction to begin.\"Here we are, living a life of humiliation,\" she told the BBC. \"We want caravans. We want our homes rebuilt. We long for concrete to keep us warm. Every day I sit and cry for my children.\"Two months into an American-imposed ceasefire, Gaza is stuck in the first phase of Donald Trump's peace plan - its territory divided between the warring parties, its people still displaced and surrounded by rubble.Heavy rain has deluged camps and led several buildings to collapse, as a powerful winter storm sweeps through the Strip. More than 800,000 Gazans are at risk from flooding, the UN says.Ghadir al-Adham is longing to move her children into a solid homeSticking pointPlans for new homes - and new government - lie frozen in the next stage of US President Donald Trump's peace deal, as the search continues for Israel's last missing hostage, Ran Gvili.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has insisted Hamas must return all Israel's hostages – living and dead – before the two sides move on to the next, more difficult, stage of the peace deal.But several searches of Gaza's rubble have so far shown no sign of him. Mr Gvili was captured during the 7 October Hamas attacks - a police officer, recovering from a broken shoulder, who went to defend nearby kibbutz Alumim.HandoutYellow flags have been hung for Ran Gvili near his home in southern IsraelHis parents, Talik and Itzik, were told last year he had not survived.The road to their home in Meitar, in southern Israel, is lined with banners paying tribute to him, the yellow flags of remembrance for Israel's hostages fluttering alongside.\"They stole our kid, they stole him,\" his mother Talik told me.\"They know where he is,\" Itzik said. \"They just try to hide or keep him. They're play[ing] with us.\"They believe Hamas wants to keep their son as an insurance policy against future negotiations, after returning all the other hostages, both living and dead.Itzik Gvili (right) accuses Hamas of trying to hide his sonIn response, a Hamas official told the BBC their allegations were untrue, and that Israel was trying to avoid implementing the agreement.But with no sign of Ran's body, and pressure from Washington growing, his parents say they are counting on Israel's leaders not to move forward before their son is found.\"Everyone in Israel['s] government says to us, 'No, we don't move to the second level until Ran comes back.' This is their promise,\" Talik said.Many in Israel believe it would be politically difficult for Netanyahu to carry out the next steps in the deal, including withdrawing Israeli forces further back towards Gaza's perimeter, if even one hostage is still missing in Gaza.Time 'running out'Both Israel and Hamas face difficult concessions in the next stage of the deal.  For Hamas, it means handing over weapons and power. For Israel, handing over security to an international stabilisation force.And this is also why leaders on both sides may be hesitating, says retired General Israel Ziv, a former head of Israel's military Operations Directorate.\"Israel and Hamas are sharing the same interests not to move so fast into the second stage,\" he told me. \"Hamas doesn't want to lose control, and the Israeli side for political reasons also prefer to stay in Gaza, as nobody wants to explain to their base that they have to withdraw.\"He says Trump is the only one who can force the two sides forward, and that time is running out.\"By waiting I think we might miss the opportunity because Hamas is reorganising and [its] strength is coming back,\" he explained. \"We have to take a deep breath and go forward with that plan, because staying in the situation as it is, it's the worst-case scenario.\"Disarming Hamas – in a way both sides will accept – is seen as the first major hurdle.  Without that, no foreign countries are likely to commit troops to secure the Strip, and no reconstruction is likely to begin in Hamas-controlled areas.Earlier this week, Netanyahu suggested he was sceptical that foreign nations could complete the task in place of Israel.\"Our friends in America want to try to establish an international force that will do the job,\" he said. \"We know that there are certain tasks that this force can do. I don't want to go into detail, they can't do everything, and maybe they can't do the main thing, but we'll see.\"Trump eager to move fastGaza is currently divided in two by the \"yellow line\" marking the limits of Israeli forces under the first stage of the ceasefire deal.Israel's military chief of staff recently referred to it as a \"new border line\", sparking accusations that Israel was signalling an intention to remain there long term.Key issues, including how to disarm Hamas, are due to be discussed at a meeting between Netanyahu and Trump in Florida later this month.The US president – who has already brokered a ceasefire in Gaza and pushed his peace plan through the UN Security Council – has been outspoken about his desire to move the process forward.He told journalists this week that he would announce the membership of a newly created Board of Peace for Gaza early next year. \"It will be one of the most legendary boards ever… Everybody wants to be on it,\" he said.Getty ImagesThe floods make it hard for Gazans to keep children dryThere are also widespread reports that, under pressure from Washington, Israel is beginning work to clear rubble, in preparation for a new temporary housing project in the Israeli-held area of Rafah, in the south of the Strip.The new housing could reportedly provide shelter for tens of thousands of Gazans, on condition that they are willing to cross into Israeli-held areas, and submit to checks for any links to Hamas.Some see it as part of a plan to draw Gazans across into Israeli-held areas, in order to isolate Hamas. A small number of people have already crossed into these areas, to camps set up by armed groups supported by Israel there.But many Gazans – even those who want to replace Hamas – say they refuse to live under Israeli control.It's a glimpse of an alternative future for Gaza, if this second stage of Trump's plan fails; a future where Gaza, already divided, becomes more divided still.",

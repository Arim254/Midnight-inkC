    "body": "Ukraine's energy and justice ministers have resigned in the wake of a major investigation into corruption in the country's energy sector.President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko's removal on Wednesday. On Monday anti-corruption bodies accused several people of orchestrating a embezzlement scheme in the energy sector worth about $100m (£76m), including at the national nuclear operator Enerhoatom.Some of those implicated in the scandal are - or have been - close associates of Zelensky's.The allegation is that Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and other key ministers and officials received payments from contractors building fortifications against Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Among those alleged to be involved are former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95. He has since reportedly fled the country. Halushchenko said he would defend himself against the accusations, while Grynchuk said on social media: \"Within the scope of my professional activities there were no violations of the law.\"The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the investigation - which was 15 months in the making and involved 1,000 hours of audio recordings - uncovered the participation of several members of the Ukrainian government. According to Nabu, the people involved systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.Prosecutors alleged that the scheme's proceeds were laundered through an office in Kyiv linked to the family of former Ukrainian lawmaker and current Russian senator Andriy Derkach.Nabu has been releasing new snippets of its investigation and wiretaps every day and on Tuesday it promised more would come.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants. It will also shine a spotlight on corruption in Ukraine, which continues to be endemic despite work by Nabu and Sap in the 10 years since they were created. In July, nationwide protests broke out over changes curbing the independence of Nabu and Sap. Ukrainians feared the nation could lose the coveted status of EU candidate country which it was granted on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption. Kyiv's European partners also expressed severe alarm at the decision, with ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressing the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.The backlash was the most severe to hit the Ukrainian government since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate the freedom of the two anti-corruption bodies.Yet for some that crisis brought into question Zelensky's dedication to anti-corruption reforms. The latest scandal threatens to lead to more awkward questions for the Ukrainian president. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesA deadly car blast in a busy area of India's capital city Delhi was a \"terror incident\", the country's government has said.At least eight people were killed and 20 more injured in the explosion near the city's historic Red Fort on Monday.Prime minister Narendra Modi's cabinet condemned the attack at a security meeting late on Wednesday, saying it was a cowardly act carried out by anti-national forces.Authorities have not yet named anyone or made any arrests in connection with the explosion.In Wednesday's resolution, the cabinet said: \"The country has witnessed a heinous terror incident, perpetrated by anti-national forces, through a car explosion.\"The cabinet directs that the investigation into the incident be pursued with the utmost urgency and professionalism so that the perpetrators, their collaborators, and their sponsors are identified and brought to justice without delay.\"The cabinet also said it \"unequivocally condemns this dastardly and cowardly act that has led to the loss of innocent lives\".India has an \"unwavering commitment\" to a zero tolerance policy towards terrorism, it added.The explosion happened near a metro station close to the Red Fort, one of Delhi's most high-profile landmarks.Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters the incident happened at around 18:52 local time (13:52 GMT), when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light before it exploded, damaging nearby vehicles.A police spokesperson told the BBC that the explosion came from a Hyundai i20 car that was moving and carrying three people at the time, a police spokesman told the BBC. As news of the explosion broke, Delhi police declared a high alert, with neighbouring states quickly following suit, including the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which is home to famous sites like the Taj Mahal and is a densely populated region.Police, forensic experts, and security teams are investigating the explosion, a minister said on Monday after the incident.\"We are exploring all possibilities and will conduct a thorough investigation, taking all possibilities into account. All options will be investigated immediately and we will present the results to the public,\" home minister Amit Shah said.Modi sent his condolences to those who lost loved ones in the blast. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said the news was \"extremely heartbreaking\".The Red Fort was built in the the 17th Century and is visited by thousands of tourists daily. Indian prime ministers give their annual Independence Day speeches at the site.",

    "body": "57 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAlmost a year to the day since French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal was arrested on arrival at Algiers airport, the Algerian president has pardoned him and allowed him to leave the country.Sansal, 81, has been at the centre of a bitter diplomatic row between Paris and Algiers and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune's decision came in response to a direct approach from German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.The writer arrived in Germany on a military plane on Wednesday evening and was taken to hospital.French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Sansal by phone, said France had used respect and calm to bring about his freedom.\"I thank President Tebboune for this act of humanity,\" said Macron.Although Paris had for months sought to lower tensions with Algeria, it was the German president's role that secured Sansal's release because of his good relations with Algeria's leader.French ambassador Stéphane Romatet, who was recalled from Algiers earlier this year for consultations because of the row, told French radio on Thursday that the crisis is relations was so deep that \"from the start we knew a happy outcome... would go through a trusted third party and the German solution quickly came forward\".Steinmeier said this week he had asked President Tebboune to pardon Sansal, \"given his advanced age and fragile health\", so the writer could receive medical treatment in Germany.Tebboune said on Wednesday he had decided to respond favourably to Steinmeier's request \"because of its nature and humanitarian motives\". Sansal is being treated for prostate cancer.He was given a five-year jail sentence in July for undermining national unity with remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.The novelist has long been a critic of Algeria's government, which had not responded favourably to France's appeal for clemency.Relations had already been on the slide after President Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.The spat worsened in April when Algeria expressed outrage after one of its consular staff in France was arrested over the kidnapping of a government critic in Paris.The crisis between the two countries was seen as unprecedented in more than 60 years since Algeria secured independence from France in 1962.Some French commentators and political figures blamed what was seen as a confrontational stance to Algeria taken by right-wing former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau and others on the right of French politics.Algerian minister Sofiane Chaib also blamed Retailleau earlier this year for the \"fabricated spat\".Then at the end of last month a motion by France's National Rally was narrowly passed by MPs opposing a 1968 Franco-Algerian migration accord that granted residency rights to Algerians.Although the move was seen as a potential setback, the decision to replace Retailleau with Laurent Nuñez as interior minister appeared to signal a new mood.\"He has completely changed the way relations with [Algeria] are handled\", ex-diplomat Jean-Christophe Ruffin told French radio.Retailleau responded to Sansal's release on Wednesday speaking of \"immense relief and great joy\".Tensions between the two countries remain, though, after French sportswriter Christophe Gleizes was jailed for seven years in July for allegedly trying to interview a member of a movement designed by Algeria as a terrorist group.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot praised diplomats for their work in securing Sansal's release, and said they remained focused on Gleizes, \"whose imminent release we are hoping for\".",

    "body": "19 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlineAt least 19 people have been killed in an air strike on a suspected rebel camp in Colombian province of Guaviare, according to the country's military. The attack targeted a dissident faction of the Farc rebel group, which engages in drug trafficking.Colombia's left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, had in the past been reluctant to use air strikes to hit rebel camps but following the breakdown of peace talks with several of Colombia's armed groups, he gave the green light for the military offensive. The air strike comes after the Trump administration accused Petro of allowing the drugs trade to expand, which the Colombian president has denied. Colombian Defence Minister Pedro Sánchez said that President Petro had authorised the air strike after learning of \"the imminent threat [the group] posed to the population and the security forces\".Sánchez said that the camp belonged to members of a dissident group led by a commander known by the alias of Iván Mordisco.Mordisco once formed part of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) but broke away from the rebel group as it negotiated a peace deal with the government, which he did not support. He is considered to be the most powerful dissident rebel leader in Colombia, whose group engages in illegal mining and extortion as well as drug trafficking. Defence Minister Sánchez described Mordisco as \"one of the most dangerous criminals and drug traffickers\" in the country. During the military operation, the security forces also detained three people and freed three children who had been recruited by the group. The forced recruitment of children by armed groups has been on the rise in recent years in Colombia according to rights groups, which have documented how children as young as nine are kidnapped, or lured away from their parents with false promises. After Petro, Colombia's first left-wing president, was sworn in, he opened peace talks with a number of armed groups in an attempt to make good on his campaign promise to bring \"total peace\" to the country.Mordisco's group was one of those that entered into talks, but they broke down  after six months when Mordisco led a walk-out. The government blames the group for a deadly explosive attack on a military facility in the city of Cali in August.Following that explosion, Petro described Mordisco as \"a drug trafficker disguised as a revolutionary\".Petro is under pressure by the United States to combat drug trafficking.Colombia is the world's biggest producer of cocaine and the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says Petro \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity\".Last month, the US government imposed financial sanctions on the Colombian president. Petro in turn has accused the United States government of \"murder\" over the US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific allegedly carrying drugs. On Tuesday, he again expressed his opposition to the US strikes - in which at least 76 people have been killed - and ordered his government to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies.In his post on X, he said that \"the fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoDavid Gritten and Sebastian Usher,JerusalemReutersDonald Trump has repeatedly asked for a pardon for his close ally Benjamin NetanyahuIsrael's President Isaac Herzog has received a letter from US President Donald Trump formally urging him to \"fully pardon\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Netanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He has denied any wrongdoing.In the letter, Trump writes that he \"absolutely\" respects the independence of Israel's justice system, but that he believes Netanyahu is facing \"a political, unjustified prosecution\".Herzog's office said he held Trump \"in the highest regard\", but that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.Netanyahu later thanked Trump for the \"incredible support\".\"As usual, you get right to the point and call it like it is,\" he wrote on X. \"I look forward to continuing our partnership to bolster security and expand peace.\"In 2020, Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial.In the first case, prosecutors have alleged that he received gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours.He is accused in the second case of offering to help improve the circulation of an Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverage.And in the third, prosecutors have alleged that he promoted regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder of an Israeli telecoms company in exchange for positive coverage by a news website.Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch-hunt\" by political opponents.Last month, after helping to broker the ceasefire in Israel's two-year with Hamas in Gaza, Trump said Herzog should pardon his close ally in a seemingly off-the-cuff remark during a speech to the Israeli parliament.\"Cigars and Champagne, who the hell cares about that?\" he asked.In his letter to the president, Trump writes: \"As the Great State of Israel and the amazing Jewish People move past the terribly difficult times of the last three years, I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace.\"He adds: \"While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that this 'case' against Bibi [Netanyahu], who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political, unjustified prosecution.\"The response from Herzog's office is diplomatic, saying that he \"holds President Trump in the highest regard and continues to express his deep appreciation for President Trump's unwavering support for Israel\".It also politely points out that \"anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures\".According to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute their sentence\".However, the High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president could pardon an individual before they are convicted, if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.A pardon would also need to be requested by the accused or a close relative.There has been no public indication of this so far, although there is speculation in the Israeli media that this could happen.Israel GPOIsrael's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, urged Herzog to \"listen to President Trump\", saying Netanyahu's trial had \"become an indictment against the prosecution itself, whose carelessness and crimes are revealed in court every day\".However, Israel's opposition leader and former prime minister, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: \"Reminder: Israeli law stipulates that the first condition for receiving a pardon is an admission of guilt and an expression of remorse.\"He later told Israel's parliament: \"There comes a moment when people must tell themselves... we must also say 'no' to an American president. We are a sovereign country; there's a limit to interference.\"For Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters, a pardon has long been sought since his trial began.But for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.It was fears that this was under attack with the government's plans for judicial reforms that brought hundreds of thousands out onto the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 that triggered the Gaza war.",

    "body": "Italy investigates claims of tourists paying to shoot civilians in Bosnia in 1990s12 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Eastern and Southern Europe correspondent and Guy Delauney,Balkans correspondentAP Photo/Jerome DelayCivilians risked their lives to cross Sarajevo's main boulevard during the Bosnian warThe public prosecutor's office in Milan has opened an investigation into claims that Italian citizens travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina on \"sniper safaris\" during the war in the early 1990s.Italians and others are alleged to have paid large sums to shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo.The Milan complaint was filed by journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni, who describes a \"manhunt\" by \"very wealthy people\" with a passion for weapons who \"paid to be able to kill defenceless civilians\" from Serb positions in the hills around Sarajevo.Different rates were charged to kill men, women or children, according to some reports.More than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo.Yugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.Similar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years, but the evidence gathered by Gavazzeni, which includes the testimony of a Bosnian military intelligence officer, is now being examined by Italian counter terrorism prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis.The charge is murder.CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFPMore than 11,000 civilians died in the three-year siege of SarajevoThe Bosnian officer apparently revealed that his Bosnian colleagues found out about the so-called safaris in late 1993 and then passed on the information to Italy's Sismi military intelligence in early 1994.The response from Sismi came a couple of months later, he said. They found out that \"safari\" tourists would fly from the northern Italian border city of Trieste and then travel to the hills above Sarajevo.\"We've put a stop to it and there won't be any more safaris,\" the officer was told, according to Ansa news agency. Within two to three months the trips had stopped.Ezio Gavazzeni, who usually writes about terrorism and the mafia, first read about the sniper tours to Sarajevo three decades ago when Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the story, but without firm evidence.He returned to the topic after seeing \"Sarajevo Safari\", a documentary film from 2022 by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic which alleges that those involved in the killings came from several countries, including the US and Russia as well as Italy.Gavazzeni began to dig further and in February handed prosecutors his findings, said to amount to a 17-page file including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic.MICHAEL EVSTAFIEV/AFPSnipers would shoot at civilians from areas controlled by the Bosnian Serbs overlooking SarajevoAn investigation in Bosnia itself appears to have stalled.Speaking to Italy's La Repubblica newspaper, Gavazzeni alleges that \"many\" took part in the practice, \"at least a hundred\" in all, with Italians paying \"a lot of money\" to do so, up to €100,000 (£88,000) in today's terms.In 1992, late Russian nationalist writer and politician Eduard Limonov was filmed firing multiple rounds into Sarajevo from a heavy machine gun. He was being given a tour of hillside positions by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was later convicted of genocide by an international tribunal in the Hague. Limonov didn't pay for his war tourism, though. He was there as an admirer of Karadzic, telling him: \"We Russians should take example from you.\"Italian prosecutors and police are said to have identified a list of witnesses as they try to establish who might have been involved.However, members of the British forces who served in Sarajevo in the 1990s have told the BBC that they never heard of any so-called \"sniper tourism\" during  the Bosnian conflict.They indicated that any attempts to bring in people from third countries who had paid to shoot at civilians in Sarajevo would have been \"logistically difficult to accomplish\", due to the proliferation of checkpoints.British forces served both inside Sarajevo and in the areas surrounding the city, where Serb forces were stationed and they saw nothing at the time to suggest that \"sniper tourism\" was taking place.One soldier described the allegations that foreigners had paid to shoot at civilians as an \"urban myth\".",

    "body": "How the Japan PM's Taiwan remarks provoked the fury of China1 day agoKoh EweEPA/ShutterstockJapanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Japan could respond with its self-defence force if China attacked TaiwanOver the past week, China and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words.It all started when Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested that if China attacked Taiwan then Japan could respond with its own self-defence force.Since then, foreign ministries on both sides have lodged serious protests with the other, and a Chinese diplomat made what some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of Taiwan.Here's what to know.What happened? A timelineThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.A \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.Takaichi's remarks drew ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".On Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".While the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.Tokyo has lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing has lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.On Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful commenting on specific scenarios from now on.A long history of animosityThere is a longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.Historical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, Shinzo Abe's protege, suggests more tensions may lie ahead.The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.Getty ImagesThe US and Japan have been deliberately ambiguous on how they would respond, should China invade TaiwanTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.Why Takaichi's recent comments caused such a stirThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.This is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentPraful Gangurde/Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesMembers of India's Banjara community demand reservation benefits in MumbaiCounting castes in India has always been about more than numbers - it is about who gets a share of government benefits and who doesn't.The country's next national census, scheduled for 2027, will -  for the first time in nearly a century - count every caste, a social hierarchy that has long outlived kingdoms, empires and ideologies. The move ends decades of political hesitation and follows pressure from opposition parties and at least three states that have already gone ahead with their own surveys. A 2011 survey - neither run nor verified by census authorities or released by the government - recorded an astonishing 4.6 million caste names.A full count of castes promises a sharper picture of who truly benefits from affirmative action and who is left behind. Advocates say it could make welfare spending more targeted and help recalibrate quotas in jobs and education with hard evidence. Yet in a provocative new book, The Caste Con Census, scholar-activist Anand Teltumbde warns that the exercise may harden the deeply discriminatory caste system, when the need is to dismantle it.The argument cuts against the prevailing view that better data will produce fairer policy. For Mr Teltumbde, castes are \"too pernicious to be managed for any progressive purpose\". \"Caste is, at its core, a hierarchy seeking impulse that defies measurement,\" he writes.Mr Teltumbde sees the modern caste census as a colonial echo.British administrators began counting castes in 1871 as a \"deliberate response to the post-1857 unity of Indians across caste and religion\", turning it into an \"effective tool of imperial control\". They held six caste censuses between 1871 and 1931 - the last full caste enumeration in India.Each count, Mr Teltumbde argues, \"did not merely record caste, but reified and hardened it\". Independent India, in Mr Teltumbde's reading, preserved the system under the moral banner of social justice, \"while effectively evading its core obligation of building the capacities of all people, which is a prerequisite for the success of any genuine social justice policy\". The obsession with counting, he says, bureaucratises inequality. By turning caste into a ledger of entitlements and grievances, the census reduces politics to arithmetic - who gets how much - rather than addressing what Mr Teltumbde calls the \"architecture of social injustice\".He sees the demand for a caste census as a push for more reservations - a cause driven by an \"upwardly mobile minority\", while the majority slips into deprivation and dependence on state aid. Nearly 800 million Indians, he notes, now rely on free rations.Fairfax Media via Getty ImagesA 2011 unreleased survey recorded an astonishing 4.6 million caste names in IndiaAffirmative action quotas were first reserved for Dalits - formerly known as untouchables - and Adivasis (tribespeople), India's most oppressed groups. But soon, the less disadvantaged \"other backward classes\" (OBCs) began clamouring for a share of the pie. Politics quickly coalesced around demands for new or bigger caste-based quotas.Mr Teltumbde's deeper worry is that enumeration legitimises what it measures. Political parties, he warns, will exploit the data to redraw quotas or convert caste resentment into electoral capital. For Mr Teltumbde, the only rational politics is one of \"annihilation of caste\", not its management - echoing what BR Ambedkar, the architect of India's constitution, argued when he said that caste cannot be reformed, it \"must be destroyed\".But in an India where even its victims \"see value in its preservation\", that goal feels utopian, the author admits. The looming caste census, Mr Teltumbde argues, will not expose inequality but entrench it.Many scholars don't quite agree, seeing the census as a necessary tool for achieving social justice. Sociologist Satish Deshpande and economist Mary E John call the decision not to count castes \"one of independent India's biggest mistakes\".Today, they note in a paper, caste has come to be seen as the burden only of India's lower castes - Dalits and Adivasis - who must constantly prove their identity through official labels. What's needed, they write, is \"a fuller, more inclusive picture where everyone must answer the question of their caste\". This isn't an \"endorsement of an unequal system\", they stress, but a recognition that \"there is no caste disprivilege without a corresponding privilege accruing to some other caste\".In other words, the lack of reliable caste data obscures both privilege and deprivation.Sociologist and demographer Sonalde Desai told me that without a fresh caste census, India's affirmative action policies operate \"blindly\", relying on outdated colonial data.\"If surveys and censuses could shape social reality, we would not need social policies. We could simply start asking questions about domestic violence to shame people into refraining from wife-beating. We have not asked any questions in the census about caste since 1931. Has it eliminated caste equations?\" she asks.AFP via Getty ImagesBR Ambedkar, architect of India's constitution, argued that caste must be destroyed Political scientist Sudha Pai, however, broadly agrees with Mr Teltumbde's critique that counting castes can solidify identities and distract from deeper inequalities based on \"land, education, power and dignity\". Yet she acknowledges that caste has already been politicised through welfare and electoral strategies, making a caste census inevitable.\"A caste census would be useful if the income levels within each caste group are collected. The government could then use the data collected to identify within each caste the needs of the truly needy and offer them the required benefits and opportunities, such as education and jobs for upward mobility,\" Dr Pai says.\"This would require moving away from simply using caste as the parameter for redistribution of available resources, to use of both caste and income levels in policymaking.\"Dr Pai argues that if done \"thoughtfully\" - linking caste data to income and educational indicators - it could shift India from a \"caste-based to a rights-based welfare system\".Yet, scholars warn that counting castes and interpreting the data will be fraught with challenges.\"It won't be painless. India has changed tremendously in the century since 1931. Castes that were designated as being poor and vulnerable may have moved out of poverty, some new vulnerabilities may have emerged. So if we are to engage in this exercise honestly, it cannot be done without reshuffling the groups that are eligible for benefits,\" says Professor Desai.Another challenge lies in data collection - castes have many subgroups, raising questions about the right level of classification. Sub-categorisation aims to divide broader caste groups into smaller ones so the most disadvantaged among them receive a fair share of quotas and benefits.\"Castes are not made of a single layer. There are many subgroups within a single caste. What level of aggregation should be used? How will the respondents in a census respond to this question? This requires substantial experimentation. I do not believe this has yet been done,\" says Prof Desai.Mr Teltumbde remains unconvinced. He argues that endless enumeration cannot remedy a system built on hierarchy. \"You will be counting all your life and still not solve the caste problem. So what will be the use of that counting?,\" he wonders. \"I am not against affirmative action, but this is not the way to do it.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoGuy DelauneyBalkans correspondentGuy Delauney/BBCRussian state-owned energy companies own more than half of Serbia's national oil firm NISAn impasse over Russian oil and imminent US sanctions has put Serbia at loggerheads with its traditional ally in Moscow.Added differences over Russian gas supplies and Serbia's arms trade have ramped up the tensions, with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic trading barbs with the Kremlin.The root of the problem, and the most pressing issue, is the fate of Serbia's national oil company.Russia's Gazprom and Gazprom Neft own more than half the shares of Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS). That has put the company in a tight spot, after US sanctions on NIS came into effect last month over its ties to Russia's energy industry.Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic has told the BBC that NIS's Russian owners have now asked the US for a waiver, which indicated \"the Russian side was ready to transfer the control and influence upon the company to a third party\". But she warns time is running out.The impact of US sanctions on NIS has been immediate. Its petrol stations have put up signs warning customers that Visa and Mastercard can no longer be used to pay for fuel, as the US credit card giants have stopped processing payments. The same applies to outlets of NIS's Russian shareholders. At a Gazprom service station on the motorway between Novi Sad and Belgrade, Bojan and his colleagues were taking no chances, pumping the petrol and diesel for their customers. That gave them the opportunity to check whether the drivers had the means to pay, and Bojan said about one in 10 customers did not – \"mostly foreigners\". A cash machine has been installed inside the service station just in case.Guy Delauney/BBCGazprom-owned service stations in Serbia are now only taking cashNIS operates both of Serbia's oil refineries, providing more than four-fifths of its petrol and diesel, and almost all its jet and heavy fuels.Serbia is landlocked, so it relies on Croatia to deliver oil via its Janaf pipeline. But since sanctions kicked in, the flow has been cut off.The refineries will run out of crude to process before the end of November, which is why the energy minister says time is running out.Serbia is not the only Balkan country grappling with US sanctions.Neighbouring Bulgaria has passed legislation to take over its only oil refinery from Russian oil giant Lukoil, ahead of sanctions kicking in on 21 November.Hungary's Viktor Orban has secured a one-year waiver from his ally President Donald Trump.At the start of November a queue of NIS tankers could be seen waiting for entry to the jet fuel storage facilities at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport, delivering supplies while they still could.National airline Air Serbia told the BBC that it was \"adjusting [its] business activities\" and had taken \"the necessary steps\" to ensure it could keep its planes in the air.Russia's shareholders have not been in a rush to sell their stakes in NIS, even though Belgrade says they are now prepared to act. Nationalisation would be another possibility, as in Bulgaria, but Serbia has been reluctant to follow suit, in large part due to its longstanding friendship with Russia. Unlike its neighbours it is not part of the EU, which has banned imports of Russian oil, although it is a candidate to join.Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool via REUTERSRelations between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Serbia's Aleksandar Vucic have cooled in recent monthsThe episode has undoubtedly strained relations with Moscow. Behind the scenes, there is a great deal of exasperation in Serbian government circles.The energy minister chose her words carefully, but her frustration was clear.\"The overall income in the Gazprom group of NIS is insignificant,\" Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic told the BBC.\"We know NIS is not crucial for Russia's energy sector and contributing significantly to any income for the Russian government. However, for Serbia it is very important.\"\"These [US] sanctions will harm Serbian people, because of the majority share that NIS has in the market. NIS employs 13,500 people in Serbia, so employees are important for us as well as stability in the market.\"Oil is not the only problem. Serbia also relies on Russian gas, delivered at a highly favourable rate. But the current supply deal expires at the end of the year – and Moscow seems in no rush to renew, leaving President Vucic \"very disappointed\".\"It is obvious we didn't get the gas agreement because there is a possibility that we could nationalise NIS,\" says Zeljko Markovic, a Serbian energy sector consultant.\"We can supply Serbia without Russian gas, but the question is at what price? We have been using Russian gas at a lower than market price. And are we prepared with the contracts and the capacities?\"Arms and ammunition exports have also soured relations with Russia. Serbia's defence companies have not supplied Ukraine directly, but they have made deliveries to third countries which then re-exported the munitions.Earlier this year, Moscow made it clear this was no longer acceptable – and President Vucic imposed an export embargo. But at the end of last month he changed tack, saying he was happy for Serbia to export arms and ammunition to EU countries, adding that the buyers could \"do what they want\" with the deliveries.This triggered a testy exchange between Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova and Vucic.There are signs of movement.If the bid for a US waiver works, then the sanctions will be lifted, and oil will start flowing to NIS's refineries again. But there is still no sign of a gas deal – and the extent of the damage to Serbian-Russian relations may be significant.Vucic often insists that Serbia's path leads towards the European Union. If nothing else, this episode may strengthen that conviction.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSean Dilley,North America Correspondent, Ed Campbell,BBC News Investigations and Chris GrahamIndigo / Getty ImagesAndrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges (file photo)Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor told Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell \"I can't take any more of this\", when he was first alerted 14 years ago that a British newspaper was about to run a report about the trio.His email conversation with the US-based pair was among documents from the estate of the convicted sex offender Epstein that were released on Wednesday, including some mentioning Donald Trump. The former prince's response came after he was forwarded a right-of-reply email that the Mail on Sunday had sent Maxwell in March 2011, which made numerous claims about Andrew.According to files released on Wednesday, Andrew's reply reads: \"What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"The latest release comes after Andrew was requested by Democrats in US Congress to answer questions as part of its investigation into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee, Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, told BBC Two's Newsnight that Andrew had not yet responded to the Committee's invitation to testify before the committee. He said the former prince \"doesn't have to get on a plane to testify, he can do it remotely\". Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein - alleged Andrew had sex with her three times as a teenager. Andrew, who has denied the allegations, reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology.He was stripped of all his titles earlier this month after Giuffre's posthumous memoir threw new focus on Andrew's ties to Epstein and Maxwell.Trump mentioned in emailsWhite House: Epstein story 'a manufactured hoax'Three emails from the Epstein estate, released by Democrats on the Congressional House Oversight Committee, indicate that Trump was mentioned several times by Epstein in emails exchanged with Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. They also released emails between Epstein and the author Michael Wolff, who has written numerous books about Trump.One email from Epstein to Maxwell, sent in April 2011, claims that Trump spent hours at Epstein's house with a person whose name was redacted.Epstein wrote: \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.\"The White House later said the unnamed \"victim\" referenced was Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year. In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\".Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse. And in a memoir released this year, she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.Within hours, House Republicans then released thousands more documents to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to \"cherry-pick\" documents. They also said it had been an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".Hours after the latest publication of emails, the newly-sworn in Democratic Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva signed a petition, meaning it now has sufficient numbers to force a House vote that could require the US Department of Justice to release all the Epstein files.The office of House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said the House would hold that vote next week.Epstein on Andrew photoPA MediaAndrew, with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell.The latest files shed further light on the relationship between Andrew and Epstein, with one email appearing to confirm a photograph of Andrew with his arm around a 17-year-old Giuffre was real. In an exchange with a journalist in July 2011, Epstein appeared to discuss Giuffre and her photograph with Andrew. \"Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have,\" he wrote. Andrew said in his 2019 Newsnight interview that he had no recollection of that photo being taken and has suggested it might be fake.That exchange came four months after the purported \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March 2011. The email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.On 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including the now infamous photograph of Andrew and Giuffre.The email goes on to say that the masseuse and another girl were directed to sit on Andrew's knee in Epstein's New York flat, and that he groped both girls. The email says that one of the girls was directed by Maxwell to have sex with Andrew. It also states she was directed to participate in an orgy with Andrew at Little St James - Epstein's private Caribbean island. It requests a reply by noon the next day.It appears that the email is sent to Maxwell by her representative, forwarded on to Epstein and then to a redacted email address marked \"The Duke\".On 6 March 2011, the day the Mail on Sunday published its Giuffre story, Epstein emails \"The Duke\", asking: \"You ok?\". He add: \"These stories are complete and utter fantasy\".In an email to his publicist in July that year, Epstein writes: \"The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar.\"I think Buckingham Palace would love it. You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has caused the Queen's son all this agro (sic).\"I promise you she is a fraud. You and I will be able to go to ascot (sic) for the rest of our lives.\"Mandelson in contact in 2016PA MediaLord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with EpsteinLord Mandelson also appears in the newly released documents, which show he had contact with Epstein as late as 2016.The latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.The new documents include an email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, saying \"63 years old. You made it\".Lord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".Epstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.Lord Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, after emails showed the peer sent him supportive messages after he pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor in 2008.Lord Mandelson, who has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein,  declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.",

They also said it was an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" she said.Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.What the Epstein-Maxwell email saysThe first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell. In it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him\". Epstein goes on to write that Trump \"has never once been mentioned\", including by a \"police chief\".Maxwell responded: \"I have been thinking about that...\"The victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name \"Virginia\". The White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year. In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\". Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse. And in a memoir released this year, she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.Asked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.What the Epstein-Wolff emails sayIn exchanges with Wolff, the author, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who - at the time - was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office. In a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, \"either on air or in scrum afterwards\".Epstein responds: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"Wolff writes: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"He adds: \"Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"Reuters\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" Wolff said on WednesdayIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump. \"There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?\", Wolff writes to Epstein.A third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office.  In it, Epstein tells Wolff: \"Trump said he asked me to resign\" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was \"never a member ever\". Epstein adds that \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop\". Responding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.Andrew emailed Epstein in 2011As well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.He responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein.Andrew's reply reads: \"Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"Maxwell had forwarded a \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and then-Prince Andrew.The right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.On 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre.Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.White House says Epstein story \"a manufactured hoax\"Peter Mandelson contacted Epstein in 2016Lord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents.They show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016, according to the documents.The latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.An email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: \"63 years old. You made it\".Lord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".Epstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.Epstein goes on to say \"you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]\", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.What the survivors have saidAnnie Farmer, one of Epstein's accusers and a key witness in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial, shared a statement after the emails were released. In it she said: \"The more information that comes out about Jeffrey Epstein, the more questions we're left with. Survivors deserve more than a trickle of information.\"Farmer demanded the \"full release\" of the so-called Epstein files and said \"the estimated one thousand women and girls who were harmed by Epstein and his associates deserve full transparency\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoTom McArthurReutersAt least 37 people were killed and dozens injured in Peru when a bus plunged into a 200m (650ft) deep ravine after a head-on collision.The incident happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning on a \"rugged\" stretch of the Pan-American Highway that connects Peru with Chile in the country's southern region of Arequipa.Local media say the bus was carrying 60 passengers when it smashed into a pickup truck on a curve, careered off the road and fell down to the banks of the Ocoña River. Bus crashes are common in Peru, especially at night and on mountain highways. This is often due to poor road conditions, excessive speed, and lack of safety signage.The bus, operated by the Llamosas company, was heading from Chala, a town in Caraveli province, to Arequipa. Both drivers reportedly survived the crash, which happened at kilometre 780 of the Pan-American Highway South.Pictures from the scene of the crash show the wrecked bus at the bottom of a steep ravine - its windows completely shattered, bodywork badly damaged and roof caved in.Waldor Llerena, Ocona's district mayor, told radio station RPP that the terrain around the crash site is \"very rugged\", and the area had a history of similar deadly accidents. Public Prosecutor's OfficePolice experts will work out the cause of the crash, officials saidThirty-six people died at the scene and another person later died in hospital, Walther Oporto, Arequipa's regional health chief told local media, citing firefighters at the scene of the crash.Health officials told RPP that 25 people - including three minors - are being treated in a local hospital for their injuries.An investigation into the incident is underway and the driver of the pickup truck has been detained, the Public Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.In 2022, more than 3,300 people died in traffic accidents in Peru, official figures suggest.Stretching from Alaska to the pencil tip of Argentina, the 48,000km-long Pan-American Highway holds the record for the world's longest road navigable by motor  vehicle.",

    "body": "The fallout from Nigeria's spectacular $25m museum and the Benin Bronzes8 hours agoTodah OpeyemiBBC Africa, Benin CityAFP/Getty ImagesGuests and dignitaries looked on as protesters stormed the Museum of West African Art in Benin City on SundayNigeria's stunning new Museum of West African Art (Mowaa) has found itself in the crosshairs of local power politics on the week it was supposed to - but failed - to open its doors to the public for the first time.The six-hectare (15-acre) campus sits in the heart of Benin City, capital of the southern state of Edo - and includes an archaeological dig and buildings designed by high-profile British-Ghanaian architect Sir David Adjaye, best known for the National Museum of African American History and Culture that opened in Washington in 2016.It has been five years in the making - and is envisioned to celebrate both the past and the present of creativity in the region famous for the Benin Bronzes, artworks looted from the city's royal palace by British soldiers in the 19th Century.It is impressive - and ahead of the planned opening, Mowaa was buzzing with staff determined to prove it is a place that can rival established museums and galleries in the West.Inside conservators carefully unwrapped artworks from protective packaging, inspecting each piece and taking meticulous records before positioning them on walls and plinths.Technicians fine-tuned climate control systems. In the materials science laboratory, officers calibrated equipment meant to preserve centuries-old artefacts.The project has been the brainchild of businessman Phillip Ihenacho - now Mowaa's executive director.\"I want us to have a significant economic impact on communities around here,\" he told the BBC, adding that he hoped to make Benin City \"a cultural destination\".Mowaa, a non-profit Nigerian institution, sees itself creating more than 30,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributing more than $80m (£60m) annually to the regional creative economy through partnerships and programming.It has taken $25m (£19m) to get here - money raised from various donors, including the French and German governments, the British Museum and the Edo state government.But now the local government has pulled the rug from under it - revoking the use of the land on which the museum was built.An Edo state spokesperson told the BBC this was because in the original paperwork it had called itself Edo Museum of West African Art - and it had since dropped \"Edo\" from its name.This announcement followed protests on Sunday, when people stormed the campus demanding it be called the Benin Royal Museum.A rowdy group insulted foreign guests at the museum ahead of the opening - forcing them to be hurried away under police escort.President Bola Tinubu has even stepped in to try and resolve the tensions, setting up a high-level committee to do some damage control.But how has this become so politicised - and such a PR disaster?Much of it comes down to internecine rivalries at a local state level, as it was Edo's previous governor Godwin Obaseki - whose term in office ended last year - who was a major backer of the museum.And it seems the administration of the new governor, a close ally of the local traditional ruler, known as the Oba, may want more of a stake in the project. The protesters on Sunday, for example, were demanding that the museum be placed under the control of Oba Ewuare II.This brings into focus the contentious issue of the Benin Bronzes, one of Africa's most celebrated cultural treasures.Because even if the museum does eventually open, these bronzes will be conspicuously absent.They are brass, ivory and wooden sculptures that once adorned the royal palace of the Benin Kingdom before British soldiers looted them in 1897 during a punitive expedition.Today, thousands remain scattered across museums in Europe and North America -- including the British Museum, Berlin's Humboldt Forum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Their return has become one of the most contested debates in the global art world. About 150 have now made their way home - and more are due to follow.When plans for the museum in Benin City were first announced in 2019, the movers and shakers on Nigeria's art scene hoped it would become their natural home - a state-of-the-art complex to show them off to the world.But the waters were muddied two years ago after the federal government announced that the Oba would be the rightful owner and custodian of any returned bronzes - and the palace pushed for a museum under the royal family's direct control, against the wishes of Obaseki, the former governor.AFP/Getty ImagesThe Oba of Benin at a ceremony in 2022 receiving one of the looted Benin BronzesThis left Mowaa in a delicate position: asserting a clear stance on restitution while remaining diplomatic on custodianship - and emphasising its broader vision, which led to it dropping \"Edo\" from its name.\"One of the frustrations I've always had is that from the beginning we have said we will be about the modern and contemporary,\" said Mr Ihenacho.\"But because of the Western story about the return of the Benin Bronzes, everyone kept referring to us as the museum where they will go. The problem with that is we are not the owners, nor do we have any legal title to the bronzes.\"His goal is to build a haven for contemporary African creativity, including film, photography, music, dance and fashion - not just visual art.\"Yes, we want to focus on the historical, but the purpose is to inspire the contemporary,\" he said.\"What we have become is a museum that is really about creating an ecosystem to support creatives in West Africa.\"From a young Nigerian artist who relocated from the US to work as a conservator, to a recent graduate undergoing his one-year mandatory national youth service programme, to a Ghanaian PhD candidate conducting research, Mowaa has already become a hub of regional collaboration.Eweka Success, a 23-year-old sculpture graduate from the University of Benin who has had a tour of Mowaa, welcomed this opportunity.He noted that while many residents of the city \"don't care\" about the restitution conversation, the museum still offered something valuable.\"Many of us have never seen the originals, but there we can study their design, technique and history more closely,\" he told the BBC.Cultural specialist Oluwatoyin Sogbesan agrees that the conversation has grown increasingly elitist.\"The everyday person is concerned about making a living, going to work, and feeding their family. Many don't even know about the bronzes,\" she told the BBC.For her, restitution must move beyond just the return of artefacts to also restore memory and language.\"We need to decolonise the term 'Benin Bronzes' itself,\" she explained.\"Call them by their original Edo name – 'Emwin Arre' [meaning 'Cultural Things'] - what the people who made them would have called them.\"This is something that chimes with the museum's inaugural exhibition - Homecoming - should it open to the public.AFP/Getty ImagesYinka Shonibare's installation features more than 150 clay replicas of the Benin BronzesIt features works by acclaimed artists such as Yinka Shonibare, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Precious Okoyomon, and Tunji Adeniyi-Jones - many of whom live in the diaspora and have rarely exhibited in Nigeria.Shonibare's Monument to the Restitution of the Mind and Soul has pride of place - a pyramid-shaped unit featuring more than 150 clay replicas of the Benin Bronzes.\"Creating a monument like this is acknowledging the trauma caused by the looting of those spiritual artefacts,\" he told the BBC. \"It's a deeply emotional engagement with the trauma of the invasion.\"He chose clay deliberately, as a metaphor for connection with the land of Benin itself.\"In the modern world, we seem to have become increasingly distanced from nature, whereas our ancestors had a deep connection and respect for it.\"The pyramid evokes Africa's ancient wonders while the replicas speak to absence and memory.\"The work is conceptual - about the meaning of absence, the spiritual meaning of the bronzes,\" Shonibare explained. \"In a way, the work is cathartic. It is almost mourning.\"Staff at the museum hope the government will resolve the dispute that has marred the excitement there was last week over the openingAlso commanding attention is Ndidi Dike's 2016 mixed-media work National Grid, which reflects on power, both electrical and political.Nigerians experience power outages so frequently they have become an accepted part of daily life - a metaphor Dike uses to question the nation's broader failures in governance and infrastructure.It is something likely to resonate all too well for those working at Mowaa this week.Though they may take heart from the words of the culture minister, who is chairing the presidential committee that wants to resolve the dispute.\"Cultural institutions are pillars of our national identity and must be protected through collaborative approaches that respect both traditional custodianship and modern institutional structures,\" Hannatu Musawa said.There are fears the row may damage ongoing efforts to reclaim Africa's stolen art, with Western museums feeling justified about their concerns over the conservation of returned works.But many working within the walls of Mowaa remain determined to show that their creativity can redefine what a modern African museum can be - with or without historic artefacts.More from the BBC on Nigeria's Benin Bronzes:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

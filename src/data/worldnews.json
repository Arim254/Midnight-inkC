    "body": "10 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesIrwin competed in the final despite having a rib injuryRobert Irwin, son of the late conservationist Steve Irwin, has been crowned this year's winner of Dancing with the Stars, a decade after his older sister Bindi won the same title. The popular US dancing competition sees stars paired with professional dancers to perform in front of a panel of judges, with the audience also voting on their favourite couple.The 21-year-old was favoured to win, with strong performances over the show's 11 weeks, including a tribute to his father and a surprise appearance from his sister Bindi. With a legion of fans in the US, Irwin's finale had an Australian bent with one dance choreographed to a song by Australian rock band Jet.During the three-hour finale on Tuesday evening, local time, Irwin and his dance partner Witney Carson also performed to songs by Avicii and Sydney-born Sam Sparro.They then triumphed in the \"instant dance challenge\" – where Irwin and Carson were told the style and song minutes before taking to the stage.Irwin, who competed in the final despite having a rib injury, beat fellow finalists including influencer Alix Earle and Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles.This came despite three contestants - not including Irwin - earning a perfect score of 30 for their first dances. However, Irwin got a perfect score not long after.Getty ImagesThe pair triumphed in the \"instant dance challenge\"He broke down in tears after his final performance, saying that said he wanted to make his father proud.\"I wish he could see it, I really wish he could be here,\" he said.Steve Irwin was famous for his TV wildlife shows which regularly saw him handling crocodiles and led to him being dubbed the \"Crocodile Hunter\".He was killed by a stingray during a diving expedition off the Australian coast in 2006, when Robert was just a baby. Following his father's love for wildlife, Robert Irwin has long been a keen photographer and recently became an Earthshot ambassador.",

    "body": "France's highest court has upheld a sentence against former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the illegal financing of his 2012 re-election campaign.He was found guilty of overspending on his campaign, then hiring a PR firm named Bygmalion to cover it up.Sarkozy, 70, was handed the one-year sentence in 2024 of which six months were suspended, meaning they could be served by wearing an electronic tag instead of going to jail.He has always denied all allegations. Prosecutors in the case said Sarkozy's UMP party spent nearly double the €22.5m (£19.4m) cap on his campaign, splurging on lavish campaign rallies and events.To hide the costs, UMP then asked Bygmalion to invoice the party, rather than the campaign.Today's is the second definitive conviction for the former president, who was in power from 2007 to 2012.Last December the High Court of Appeal upheld a corruption conviction and Sarkozy had to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet for six months.Then, in September, he was sentenced to five years in jail after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy.He spent 20 days in jail before he was released earlier in November. An appeal trial will be held next year. Until then Sarkozy will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France.Days after his release, Sarkozy's team announced the former president was writing a book about his three weeks in jail, titled \"A prisoner's diary\". An excerpt from the book was published on social media: \"In prison there is nothing to see, and nothing to do. I forget the silence that does not exist at La Santé [prison], where there is much to listen to. Here, the noise is, unfortunately, constant. But - like in the desert - inner life strengthens in jail.\"",

    "body": "A mother in New Zealand who killed her two children and hid their bodies in suitcases has been sentenced to life in prison.Hakyung Lee, who was found guilty in September of the shocking murders of eight-year-old Yuna Jo and six-year-old Minu Jo, has to spend at least 17 years behind bars before she is eligible for parole.Lee, 45, argued she was insane at the time of the killings in 2018, which happened soon after her husband died. High Court judge Geoffrey Venning said Lee's mental health played a part in the case, but that her actions were calculated.The children's remains were discovered only in 2022 by a couple who won an auction for the contents of an abandoned storage unit in Auckland.During a trial lasting more than two weeks, Hakyung Lee's defence lawyers told the court that her mental health deteriorated after Jo's death, and that she came to believe it was best if the rest of the family died together. Lee tried to kill herself and her children by giving them a dose of the antidepressant nortriptyline mixed in juice, but got the dose wrong and woke up to find her children were dead, her lawyers said.Prosecutors argued that Lee's was \"a selfish act to free herself from the burden of parenting alone\".After the killings, Lee changed her name and left New Zealand. She was arrested in South Korea - where she was born - in September 2022, and extradited back to New Zealand later that year.The court heard on Wednesday how the killings pained Lee's and her husband Ian Jo's families.In an emotional statement read out by prosecutors, Lee's mother Choon Ja Lee  said she regrets not taking her daughter to a counsellor, noting that Lee had \"no will to live\" after Jo died of cancer in November 2017.\"If she wanted to die, why didn't she die alone? Why did she take the innocent children with her?\" Choon Ja Lee wrote, according to New Zealand media reports.Jo's brother Jimmy said he \"never imagined such a profound tragedy would ever befall our family\".His own mother - Yuna's and Minu's other grandmother - still does not know they are dead, he said.\"It was my late brother's will that I protect them,\" said Jimmy Jo. \"This is an ongoing sentence from which I can never be paroled.\"Lee was likely suffering from an \"atypical depression\" and prolonged grief reaction at the time of the murders, according to a psychiatric assessment conducted before the sentencing, local broadcaster RNZ reported.Justice Venning ordered that Lee be treated as a \"special patient\" during her imprisonment, given her mental state.\"You could not cope when [your husband] became seriously unwell, and perhaps you could not bear to have the children around you as a constant reminder of your former happy life, which had been cruelly taken from you,\" the judge said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoTiffany WertheimerAFP via Getty ImagesA devastating fire has ripped through several high-rise tower blocks in Hong Kong, killing at least 13 people and injuring 15 more.Pictures show several buildings ablaze, and thick smoke billowing into the air, dominating Hong Kong's skyline.As night fell, the fire was still burning hours after it was first reported, with 767 firefighters deployed to the scene.What caused the blaze is still unclear, but here is what we do know, so far.Where and when did the fire start?The blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a large housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district, at 14:51 local time on Wednesday (06:51 GMT).Wang Fuk Court consists of eight tower blocks, which are each 31-storeys high. Seven of them have been affected by the fire, Tai Po District Councillor Mui Siu-fung tells BBC ChineseThey provide 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to the 2021 government census.Built in 1983, The tower blocks were undergoing renovations, and the outside of the buildings was covered in bamboo scaffolding. Footage shows the fire spreading quickly through the bamboo.There have been reports by residents in some local media that fire alarms did not sound.Tai Po is a residential district in the northern part of Hong Kong, near the city of Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland.How serious is the fire?The Hong Kong fire department has classified the blaze as a level five alarm - the highest in severity. Within 40 minutes of first being reported, it was declared a level four, but by 18:22, about three-and-a-half hours later, the level was raised again.It has been 17 years since a level five fire last hit Hong Kong.The ferocity of the heat was preventing firefighters from entering the buildings to conduct rescue operations, deputy director of fire services Derek Armstrong Chan told media.\"Debris and scaffolding of the affected building are falling down, posing additional danger to our front-line personnel,\" he said.He added that it was difficult to know when the fire would be fully extinguished, with residents fearing it will burn all night.As well as the 767 firefighters at the scene, there were 128 fire engines, 57 ambulances and some 400 police officers deployed.What do we know about the victims?The Hong Kong government first announced that at least four people had been killed, but then the death toll rose dramatically to 13. There are fears that number could increase further, because several people are still missing.Police officers are helping residents search for missing family members by using a loud speaker, local media reported.Of the 13 victims, nine were declared dead at the scene, Chou Wing-yin of the Fire Services Department said.At Wednesday night's news conference, the number of those injured was revised down to 15 people, after it was initially put at 28.Among the dead is a firefighter, Ho Wai-ho, 37, who had been with the service at Sha Tin Fire Station for nine years. The fire service said it lost contact with him at 15:30, and about half an hour later, found that he had collapsed. He was taken to hospital, but was declared dead shortly after.\"I am profoundly grieved at the loss of this dedicated and gallant fireman,\" Andy Yeung, director of the fire service said in a statement.At least one other firefighter is in hospital, the Hong Kong fire service said. Watch: Deadly fire engulfs Hong Kong apartment blocksEmergency hotline and shelters set upWang Fuk Court is home to some 4,600 residents, and there has been a mass evacuation in the area, including nearby buildings that are not part of the complex.Several emergency shelters have been set up to accommodate residents who were evacuated, the government said. The South China Morning Post reported that one of them - at Tung Cheong Street Sports Centre - was full, and residents were being directed to other shelters.BBC Chinese reporter Gemini Cheng saw elderly residents, some using walking sticks or wheelchairs, arriving at some of the shelters. Coaches will later transfer them to  community halls which will remain open overnight to accommodate those displaced by the fire.An emergency monitoring and support centre is in operation to manage the impact of the fire, security secretary Tang Ping-keung said in a statement.A hotline for the public to ask about casualties has been set up by Hong Kong police - the number is +852 1878 999.Hong Kong and bamboo scaffoldingReutersThe tower blocks at Wang Fuk Court are covered in bamboo scaffolding and green construction netting, right up to the rooftops, because they are undergoing renovations.Bamboo scaffolding has been used in Hong Kong for centuries, as it grows quickly, is lightweight and very strong. Many see it as an iconic part of the city's urban landscape - but Hong Kong is one of the world's last remaining cities to use it in modern construction.Local media reports in March said the government's development bureau had been trying to phase out the use of bamboo because of safety concerns. The push towards using metal instead of bamboo came after a spate of scaffolding related deaths in Hong Kong.Bamboo scaffolds have \"intrinsic weaknesses such as variation in mechanical properties, deterioration over time and high combustibility, etc, giving rise to safety concerns\", the bureau's spokesperson Terence Lam was quoted as saying.The cause of this fire is still unclear, however authorities noted that it seems to have spread quickly - and to neighbouring buildings - through the bamboo scaffolding.Additional reporting by Jack Lau, BBC Global China Unit and Gemini Cheng, BBC Chinese in Hong Kong.",

    "body": "A Chicago man who allegedly doused a woman in gasoline and lit her on fire on 17 November was a \"career criminal\", the White House has said. Lawrence Reed who was arrested for the crime had 72 prior arrests that include eight felony convictions and seven misdemeanours, according to the White House. The victim, 26-year-old Bethany MaGee, survived the attack but is \"now fighting for her life with horrific burns\", the White house said in a statement.In court on Monday, Mr Reed yelled three times in succession \"I'm guilty\", after the judge warned he could receive a life sentence for charges that include committing a terrorist attack, according to reports from inside the courtroom. The White House has sought to blame the incident on Democrats' policies on crime, casting them as \"soft\". Both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump is currently seeking to withhold federal funds from Illinois over its elimination of \"cash bail\", where an arrested person posts a sum of money to be released from jail before trial.The suspect \"was walking free because of the radical, dangerous 'no cash bail' law proudly signed by Governor JB Pritzker and celebrated by Chicago's defund-the-police Mayor Brandon Johnson\", the White House said in a statement it released on Tuesday. Mayor Johnson said in a statement that the attack \"was a tragic incident, and the Mayor's prayers are with the victim and her family.\"Mr Reed, 50, has a history of mental illness and has been arrested 72 times since he turned 18, according to a Chicago affiliate of the BBC's partner CBS News.In August, he was charged with aggravated battery for allegedly hitting a social worker and after his arrest was released with electronic monitoring against prosecutors' objections. The attack against Ms MaGee happened while she was \"minding her own business and reading her phone\", prosecutors said. According to the criminal complaint, she was approached by Mr Reed arriving from the back of the train car who then doused her with gasoline before she ran.As he chased her, the complaint said, Mr Reed ignited the rest of the liquid in the bottle and set Ms MaGee on fire. Footage of the incident appeared to show Mr Reed watching Ms MaGee as she rolled on the floor engulfed in flames attempting to extinguish the fire. Last week,  Mayor Johnson said the attack \"should have never happened\", characterising it as \"an absolute failure of our criminal justice as well as our mental health institutions\". He said the suspect clearly faced mental health challenges and presented a danger to himself and the community.As a county commissioner, Johnson in 2020 introduced a nonbinding resolution to redirect funds from police and jails to other public services, but while running for mayor in 2023 he promised not to cut police spending.",

    "body": "'Once in 300 years' rain hits Thai city as floods ravage South East Asia7 hours agoKelly NgWatch: People cling to floating debris during catastrophic floods in ThailandParts of Thailand are battling record floods, which have killed at least 33 people and prompted authorities to deploy military ships and helicopters to support relief efforts.The deluge has hit 10 provinces across the country's south over the past week, with the city of Hat Yai, a business hub bordering Malaysia, recording its heaviest rainfall in 300 years - 335mm in a single day.Photos show vehicles and houses submerged in the city, while desperate residents await rescue on their rooftops.Relentless rains have also ravaged neighbouring countries. In Vietnam, the death toll has risen to 98 in a week, while in Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been forced from their homes.In Indonesia, at least 19 people have been killed and at least seven others remained buried under landslides in North Sumatra, according to the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency.More than 2 million people in Thailand have been affected by the floods, but just 13,000 have been moved to shelters. The vast majority are cut off and unable to get help, according to Reuters news agency.The Thai military, which has been put in charge of tackling the crisis, said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies, along with field kitchens that are said to be able to deliver 3,000 meals a day.Medical teams on board the aircraft carrier will convert it into a \"floating hospital\" if required, the navy said.ReutersA drone view shows dozens of vehicles at least partially submerged in a carpark Hat YaiBoats, high-clearance trucks, and jet skis have also been deployed to evacuate residents, said the governor of Songkhla province, where Hat Yai is located.The cabinet on Tuesday declared Songkhla a disaster zone, freeing up funds for relief.However, many people remain stranded amid the rising waters. A volunteer rescue group, the Matchima Rescue Center, told Reuters it had been inundated with thousands of calls in the last three days, with people asking to be evacuated.People have also posted urgent calls for help on Matchima's Facebook page. \"Many people are trapped... Please help,\" one user wrote. \"It's very difficult right now. The water has reached the second floor, where there are children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled!!!\" Another wrote that his household had been waiting for help for three days: \"Every second is crucial now... Please help share. My [phone's] battery is at 40%. Thank you everyone.\"Some also wrote about not having had any food and water for days.A clip that has gone viral on social media shows three young boys hanging from power lines, trying to inch their way to safety while brown murky waters continue to rise below them.In Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with 126 evacuation centres set up in the northern border areas.In the states of Kelantan and Perlis, rescue teams waded through knee-deep floodwaters to evacuate residents in areas where rising waters had cut off access to roads.Heavy seasonal rain is common around this time of year in South East Asia, but this year has seen exceptionally high levels of flooding in the region.ReutersThe Thai military said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies",

    "body": "Australia's landmark social media ban for children is being challenged in the nation's highest court, with two teenagers alleging the law is unconstitutional as it robs them of their right to free communication.From 10 December, social media firms - including Meta, TikTok and YouTube - must ensure that Australians aged under 16 cannot hold accounts on their platforms.The law, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. However, 15-year-olds Noah Jones and Macy Neyland - backed by a rights group - will argue the ban completely disregards the rights of children.\"We shouldn't be silenced. It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Macy Neyland said in a statement.After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.The Digital Freedom Project (DFP) announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.Noah Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.",

    "body": "A group of military officers say they have seized control of Guinea-Bissau amid reports that the president, Umaro Sissoco Embaló, has been arrested.Shortly after gunshots were heard in capital city Bissau, government sources told the BBC that Embaló had been detained.The reports come three days after a presidential election in which the main opposition candidate was disqualified.The results were expected on Thursday - both Embaló and his closest rival Fernando Dias have claimed victory.Witnesses in Bissau heard gunfire at around 13:00 GMT on Wednesday but it was not immediately clear who was involved in the shooting or if there were any casualties.Hundreds of people on foot and in vehicles fled, seeking shelter as the shots rang out, the AFP news agency reported.Later on, army officers made an address on state TV, saying they had formed \"the High Military Command for the Restoration of Order\" and would be in charge of the West African nation until further notice.The soldiers instructed the population to \"remain calm\".Guinea-Bissau, with a population of just under two million people, is one of the poorest countries in the world. The former Portuguese colony has seen nine coups or attempted coups since 1980.There have been two attempts to overthrow Embalo, the latest in December 2023.This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has described the situation surrounding the war in Ukraine as \"volatile\" and \"dangerous\" and accused Russia of having no \"real intent\" of engaging in peace talks.Her comments came shortly before Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was \"premature\" to speak about striking a peace deal.Von der Leyen said Ukraine would need strong security guarantees capable of deterring any further attacks, arguing that Russia still upheld a post-World War Two mindset and saw the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\".She was addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg as the US ramped up efforts to mediate a deal between Kyiv and Moscow.Talks this week in Geneva and then Abu Dhabi have resulted in Ukraine agreeing to the \"essence\" of a peace deal, after changes were made to an initial 28-point plan widely criticised as heavily slanted towards Russia.Zelensky said the new draft represented \"the right approach\" - but serious points of contention with Russia remain and the Kremlin has consistently played down suggestions of a compromise.In her speech to European Union lawmakers, von der Leyen said: \"I want to be clear from the very outset: Europe will stand with Ukraine and support Ukraine every step of the way.\"She also referenced the issue of €210bn (£185bn) worth of Russian frozen assets held in European financial institutions.Belgium is currently opposing the idea of diverting these assets to Ukraine, as it fears contravening international law and being made to foot the bill should Moscow mount a legal challenge.Other countries too are concerned the repayment of the frozen assets could eventually fall to European taxpayers – although von der Leyen sought to allay those fears, saying she could not picture such a scenario. An \"options paper\" and a legal text had been prepared by the Commission, she added. A decision on the frozen assets is expected to be agreed by EU leaders in late December.The last days of intense diplomacy have largely excluded the Europeans, who last week were blindsided by the US-Russia 28-point peace plan, which included proposals to hand territory to Russia still under Ukrainian control and limit the size of Ukraine's military.European leaders have since insisted they will need a seat at the table too, before any final agreement over how to end the war can be reached. On Tuesday a meeting of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" chaired by France and the UK was convened to discuss security guarantees.\"Whatever the design of a future peace treaty, it is clear that much of the implementation will come down to the European Union and its Nato partners,\" von der Leyen told Parliament. \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. Nothing about Europe without Europe. Nothing about Nato without Nato,\" she said.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also insisted Europe was \"not a pawn, but a sovereign actor, with its own interests and values.\"However, as it stands Europeans are not set to be included in the next round of talks and Russia has batted off involvement by European leaders. \"The Europeans meddling in all these affairs is, as I see it, completely unnecessary,\" Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said.Instead, US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff is set to travel to Moscow next week, while the US Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will go to Ukraine. The US has been engaging in \"shuttle diplomacy\" between Russia and Ukraine since the start of Trump's second term in office at the start of the year - but so far such efforts have failed to yield meaningful results. Zelensky said on Tuesday he wanted direct talks with Trump before the end of the month to discuss the main divergences between the Ukrainian and the Russian positions, such as sovereignty over Ukraine's eastern regions, membership of Nato and the size of its army.  Meanwhile, Trump posted a message on social media saying he would be ready to meet both Zelensky and Putin soon, but \"ONLY when the deal to end this war is FINAL or, in its final stages\".",

    "body": "A parking inspector and his wife have been arrested on suspicion of embezzling more than €1m (£878,000) from a small German town's parking meters.The unnamed municipal employee is thought to have taken coins out of parking meters in Kempten \"on numerous occasions\" and placed them in bank accounts that his wife had access to, local police said in a statement.A money laundering report by a credit institution alerted investigators to the suspected theft. The inspector faces charges relating to 720 alleged incidents of theft, while his wife faces charges of aiding and abetting theft, also in 720 cases.Kempten Mayor Thomas Kiechle said he was \"stunned and dismayed\" by the allegations. In October, the Kempten public prosecutor's office was informed that cash was repeatedly being deposited into several bank accounts, according to the German news agency DPA.Police then searched office premises in the early hours of 24 November, the same day that the 40-year-old man and 38-year old woman were arrested.They are now being held in separate detention facilities.It is not clear how long it might have taken the couple to accrue the sum.In response to the allegations, Kiechle announced the appointment of a commission to \"review past work processes, uncover potential weaknesses, and reliably remedy them for the future.\"Kiechle noted that the names of the couple could not currently be released due to the ongoing investigation and privacy concerns.In a written statement, Kiechle said: \"I naturally support the public prosecutor's office and the police in their thorough investigation of the allegations.\"\"Until the proceedings are concluded, the presumption of innocence applies,\" he added.Kempten is one of the oldest settlements in Germany. Located in the country's south, it sits under the hills of the Allgäu and has around 70,000 residents.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has defended special envoy Steve Witkoff as doing the \"standard thing\" after a leaked recording appeared to show him advising a Russian official on how to appeal to the president.Trump told reporters on Wednesday he had not heard the audio, but that Witkoff was doing \"what a dealmaker does\" to \"sell\" the peace plan to both Russia and Ukraine.The leaked call from last month emerged days after a 28-point draft peace plan presented by the US largely reflected Russian positions on its full-scale war in Ukraine.Witkoff has visited Moscow several times this year and will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin again next week.He has never gone to Kyiv in his role as special envoy, although other US officials have visited and US army secretary Dan Driscoll went to Kyiv this week and Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was a handover to Russia of Ukrainian-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine.The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he is ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".In the leaked audio recording obtained and shared as a transcript by Bloomberg, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.Witkoff is quoted as saying that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"\"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza,\" Witkoff adds.The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere appeared to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".Asked about the call being leaked, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.According to the transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".",

    "body": "2 days agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesMarjorie Taylor Greene's five years in Congress will come to an early end on 5 January after she unexpectedly announced her resignation following a bitter rift with President Donald Trump.The surprise move from the Georgia congresswoman - a rising star in the Republican party - has left many speculating about her next steps.Her decision follows a public fallout with Trump, who branded her \"a traitor\" and said he would endorse her opponent in next year's election. It comes after months of Greene's blistering criticism on the Trump administration's refusal to release files related to the investigation into the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein - as well as several of Trump's policy positions.Rumours have already begun circulating that Greene, 51, might run for president in 2028, which she immediately shot down. So, if not the Oval Office, what is next for Greene? Run for president in 2028Although she claims she has no interest in the presidency now, having a future change of heart is not an unknown feature of US politics.When Greene signed a petition to force a vote requiring the release of the files related to Epstein - over Trump's objections - it went on to a bill authored by her Democratic colleague, Ro Khanna. Khanna told NBC News after Greene's latest announcement that she was \"likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate\", adding that she was \"more in touch\" with Trump's base than his number two, Vice-President JD Vance. Time Magazine also reported that Greene \"privately told allies\" she was considering a presidential bid, but Greene quickly dismissed the assertion as a \"complete lie\".\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene wrote on social media, re-posting Time Magazine's article. Greene has notably distanced herself from her party's positions - and from the president - for whom she once was an ardent supporter. She has spoken out against issues including Epstein files, Trump's global tariffs, support for Israel and healthcare funding. A possible run for governor or Senate Greene has not been quite as explicit about ruling out the possibility of running for Georgia governor or to represent her state in the US Senate.Elections for both take place in 2026.Two-time Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is up against his term limit and unable to run again, widening the field of possible replacements. Greene could also use her clout to pursue the race for the US Senate and attempt to unseat Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year.Both the role of governor and US senator are ones that Greene has expressed interest in, at least according to Trump.In the president's public spat with Greene following her resignation announcement, Trump wrote on social media that the feud began \"when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor\".\"She was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!)\", he said.Kennesaw State University Professor of Political Science Kerwin Swint, who lives in Greene's congressional district, says that Trump is aware of her unpopularity outside of her immediate district, and that she would probably \"get obliterated\" if she ran for statewide office.Without those options, the only other office she may have her sights on is president, despite her protestations.\"I don't see that happening,\" Swint says. \"She would be such an amazing longshot to dark horse. \"But most politicians have a big enough ego that they look in the mirror, they see a future president. So it's not out of the question.\"Entering the conservative media landscape Swint predicts that she'll start a podcast and attempt to remain in the public spotlight by continuing to build her media profile.\"I think she wants to be an influencer basically. And so I think someone who wants to do that is going to reach for these media opportunities,\" he says.If she chooses a life outside of politics, Greene would join a host of former politicians and political operatives who have launched careers in the podcast arena. After Republican Representative Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress to accept his failed nomination to become Trump's US attorney general, he started his own podcast. The trend has even caught hold on the left, with Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom also hosting his own podcast. Meanwhile, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino went on to join the Trump administration after success as a radio host and commentator.Greene could also decide to become a conservative commentator on more left-leaning networks, like CNN, where she has made frequent appearances in recent days. \"I knew she was going to be the next co-host of The View!\", conservative personality Megan McCain wrote on X, referring to Greene's recent appearance on ABC's liberal-leaning daily chat show.Leave politics behind completelyIn the 10-minute video announcing her resignation, Greene also suggested she might leave politics to spend more time with her family who she said she missed \"precious time with\" as she fought for Trump. Throughout her time in politics, Greene said, she faced \"never ending personal attacks\" and \"threats\". \"It has been unfair and wrong, not only to me, but especially to my family,\" she said.  Since her public feud with the president, Greene said the threats against her have only increased.In addition to being a member of Congress, Greene is also the owner of a commercial construction and renovation company called Taylor Commercial. The company has managed roughly $250m in construction projects, since Greene acquired it in 2002, according to her website. With reporting by Max Matza",

    "body": "10 hours agoJon DonnisonCorrespondent, JerusalemZaher IbrahimMohammed Ibrahim was 15 when he was arrested at his family's holiday home in the occupied West BankA Palestinian-American teenager is expected to appear in court in Israel later this week after nine months in detention without being charged.Mohammed Ibrahim, who is 16 and lives in Florida, was arrested in February while on holiday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank for allegedly throwing stones at Jewish settlers, something he denies.Last month, 27 Democratic US Senators and House members sent a letter to the US State Department, urging the Trump administration to do more to pressure Israel to release him.In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Mohammed had committed a \"a serious potentially deadly crime\" and that the court was proceeding under due process.The teenager's family disagrees.\"You can ask anybody you know, he's a real sweet boy, into his sports and his PlayStation and school,\" his father, Zahar Ibrahim, tells me before wiping a tear from his eye.Mohammed was arrested in a raid on his family's holiday home in the Palestinian village of al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya in the middle of the night by Israeli soldiers. He was 15 years old at the time.Mr Ibrahim has not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February.\"He's just a regular fun kid that loves and respects anybody,\" Mr Ibrahim tells me from the holiday home.Unable to speak to his son for nine months, Mr Ibrahim has only heard accounts of his detention through court documents and says his son was forced to confess.According to the court documents, he says, Mohammed woke up surrounded by Israeli soldiers. \"They tied him up and blindfolded him, and they threw him on the floor of the jeep and took him to wherever they took him.\"Mr Ibrahim, a father of four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, says his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.The Israeli prime minister's office has not responded to a request for comment on whether Mohammed is being held without charge or the allegation that he was beaten while in detention.The US embassy assigned a case worker who has visited Mohammed in prison. Mr Ibrahim says they told him he had lost a lot of weight and was not doing well.He has a message for President Donald Trump, another Florida resident.\"Do what you said from day one. You know America first. He's American, and he's a citizen and he's a child. So, you know, as a president, his [Trump's] duty is to protect Americans, and we're not seeing that for Mohammed.\"\"What's lucky about an American passport?\" Mr Ibrahim says. \"It's not helping. That's one thing that usually a foreign passport makes a difference, but the US state department is not really doing anything.\"A state department spokesperson told the BBC that it was \"tracking Mr Ibrahim's case closely and working with the government of Israel on this case\".US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and embassy staff in Jerusalem were also \"deeply involved\", they said, before adding that they could not comment further \"due to privacy and other considerations\".Zaher IbrahimMohammed is accused of throwing stones at Israeli settlers - something he deniesBecause Mohammed is an American citizen who was only on holiday in the West Bank when he was arrested, his case has attracted the attention of US lawmakers.\"This is a case where the US does have influence. It's just failing to exercise its influence, and that's a great dereliction of duty,\" says Democratic US Senator, Chris van Hollen, from his office in Washington DC.Along with 26 other US lawmakers he has written a letter to the state department and President Trump demanding more to be done to release Mohammed.\"If this were any other country, you would be seeing a much bigger effort. But for whatever reason, the Trump administration does not want to push the Netanyahu government to do what it needs to do,\" Van Hollen tells us.\"You have an American citizen who is being terribly mistreated, who has been beaten up, who has been deprived of adequate food and nutrition, and I haven't heard much from the US government. I haven't heard anything from the secretary of state. I mean, Donald Trump himself. I mean, who says that he is the 'America First' president?\"Mohammed is being held without charge at Ofer prison in the West Bank. It also houses adult detainees, including some who have been convicted of the most serious terrorist offences including murder.Mohammed's case has become relatively high profile because he is an American citizen.But there are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.\"We should be demanding justice,\" says Van Hollen.As I leave Zahar Ibrahim's holiday home in al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya, he looks drained and alone. The house is sparse. Just a set of weights to fill his time.All he can do is wait.",

    "body": "20 hours agoLisa LambertPA MediaUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shakes hands with Dan Driscoll in KyivWhen talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war took an unexpected turn last week, with the leak of a peace plan said to come from the US, the Trump administration dispatched an unlikely figure to attend a flurry of overseas meetings. The youngest-ever army secretary, 39-year-old Dan Driscoll, is often referred to as President Donald Trump's \"drone guy\" for his embrace of emerging battlefield technologies. Until recently, he was mostly known for discussions of budgets, supplies and staff issues in the military's largest branch. Driscoll does not appear to have a long history of dealing with Russia and Ukraine, or experience in international diplomacy, and has never held public office.So, who is this increasingly prominent figure within the administration?Close ally of Vice-President JD VanceIt is Driscoll's relationship with the now-vice president, JD Vance, that brought him into Trump's orbit.Like his friend Vance, Driscoll attended a public university before joining the US Army, and then earned his law degree at the prestigious Yale University. Both men also worked in finance after graduating. During his military career, Driscoll became an officer in 2007, led a cavalry platoon and deployed to Iraq for several months in 2009. He has told the story of meeting Vance through a veterans' student group at law school, during which Vance reassured new students that they would at first feel as if they did not belong, but would excel at classes after a few months. Soon, Vance became Driscoll's friend and mentor.Driscoll was on holiday with his family in Switzerland in the summer of 2024 when Vance called to tell him he was going to be Trump's running mate and asked him to join the campaign.The next day, Driscoll flew back to the US, bought a suit at an outlet mall, and took an Uber to the Republican National Convention, he told the alumni magazine for the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - the institution where he was an undergraduate.Once Trump returned to office, Driscoll was swiftly approved as army secretary in his Senate confirmation vote. His sphere of influence expanded after he became a key figure in Trump's deployment of the National Guard to US cities. Afterwards, he also took over the role of acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.Getty ImagesDriscoll at his confirmation hearing in JanuaryUnannounced visit to UkraineDriscoll has often spoken about the war in Ukraine - pointing to Ukrainian drones as a relatively cheap, mass-produced technology that is good for fighting. But after being nominated for the army secretary job, he did not initially appear to be involved in negotiations to end the war. Trump was instead relying on his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to work on a plan for a ceasefire. When details of a 28-point plan drafted by the US and Russia were leaked last week, Ukraine immediately voiced concern at some of its key points - and its European allies followed suit. Driscoll then made an unannounced visit to Ukraine along with other high-ranking Pentagon figures, the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. The purpose, according to a US Army spokesman, was to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war.Driscoll met Zelensky and was then, according to Politico, feted at a reception at the US ambassador's residence.In subsequent days, Driscoll participated in more discussions with Ukrainian officials in Geneva alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and helped draw up an \"updated and refined peace framework\". He went on to hold talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said in an effort to finalise the peace plan, he had directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. He said Driscoll would meet with the Ukrainian side.A future envoy... or defence secretary?Getty ImagesDriscoll with National Guard troops in WashingtonIn nominating Driscoll as his army secretary, Trump wrote he had a \"powerful combination of experiences to serve as a disruptor and change agent\".Some in Washington are wondering if those qualities and his recent appearance on the world stage mean that Driscoll could one day replace Pete Hegseth, if Hegseth ever steps down as defence secretary.While he has never held public office, Driscoll worked in Congress as an intern for the Senate's veteran affairs committee, and in 2020 he made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in North Carolina. A former professor has suggested Driscoll aimed \"to serve in the military, go to law school and be in politics\".There is also the possibility Driscoll could step officially into the role of negotiating with Ukraine when Trump's special envoy to the country, Keith Kellogg, leaves in January. Or he could stay as the head of hundreds of thousands of troops in the US Army. Driscoll has previously highlighted that his father and grandfather served in the military before him, and he often speaks about his vision of transforming the Army. Days before heading to Ukraine, Driscoll described to The Conversation podcast how he imagined the near future, when \"every infantryman...will carry a drone into battle\" and soldiers would rely on artificial intelligence because human brains will not be able to \"keep up\" with the pace of action. \"Our window to change is right now,\" he said in a speech in October. \"And we will win with silicon and software, not our soldiers' blood and bodies.\"",

    "body": "Israel has confirmed that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) handed over the body of deceased Israeli hostage Dror Or on Tuesday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said his government \"shares in the deep sorrow of the Or family\" following the completion of forensic testing overnight.It stressed that Israeli authorities were working \"tirelessly\" to bring home the last two dead hostages still in Gaza and demanded that Hamas uphold its commitments to hand over their remains under the six-week-old Gaza ceasefire agreement.Or's body was transferred via the Red Cross after PIJ and Hamas announced that it had been recovered in central Gaza on Monday.On Wednesday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its representatives had informed Or's family that his body was returned after experts at the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv confirmed its identity.According to the IDF, the 48-year-old father of three was killed by PIJ at his home in Kibbutz Be'eri during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. His body was then abducted and taken to Gaza as a hostage.Mr Or's wife, Yonat, was also killed during the attack, while two of their children, Noam and Alma, were kidnapped alive. They were held hostage in Gaza until November 2023, when they were released as part of a week-long ceasefire deal.\"The IDF expresses deep condolences to the families, continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages, and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement,\" an IDF statement said.\"Hamas is required to fulfil its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to a dignified burial.\"Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 330 Palestinians killed during the war. It should hand over another 15 bodies in return for Mr Or's remains.One of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli - Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 69,770 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

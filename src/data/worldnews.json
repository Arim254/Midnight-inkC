    "body": "Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder and one of the FBI's ten most wanted fugitives, has been arrested and charged with running a transnational drug trafficking operation, US media report.The reported arrest ends a years-long search for Wedding, 44, who was wanted on drug and murder charges.US officials have said they believe Wedding was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.The FBI is expected to offer more information at a 11:00 EST (16:00 GMT) news conference in California.Wedding is accused of running a vast drug trafficking operation responsible for importing some 60 metric tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles, Attorney General Pam Bondi previously said.The organisation operated across North America and other countries and was also the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, bringing in an estimated $1bn a year. Before he was arrested, Wedding was accused of killing a federal witness in a case against him.Wedding has reportedly been charged with witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking.The FBI had placed a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest. The BBC has contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the FBI for comment.Officials in the US have compared Wedding to other famous drug kingpins in Latin America, including Pablo Escobar in Colombia and Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán in Mexico.His aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI says.Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.Authorities allege he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.",

    "body": "A Canadian backpacker, who was found dead on an Australian beach and surrounded by a pack of dingoes earlier this week, likely died of drowning, an autopsy has found. Piper James, 19, had \"physical evidence consistent with drowning\" and \"injuries consistent with dingo bites\", a spokesperson for the Coroners Court of Queensland told BBC news.\"Pre-mortem dingo bite marks\" were unlikely to have caused her \"immediate death\", the spokesperson added. The autopsy was part of a preliminary assessment, and establishing her exact cause of death could take several weeks.Piper's body was found on a beach on K'Gari, an island off the eastern state of Queensland on Monday.In a statement to the BBC, the coroner also said there were \"extensive post-mortem dingo bite marks\" and that no evidence anyone else was involved.Piper's father, Todd James told Australia's 9News that the family felt relieved, as the autopsy results meant her body could be released back to her family in Canada.Her mother Angela told Global News that her daughter had always dreamed of travelling and had saved money for this trip after she graduated high school.Both parents had concerns about her travelling at her age, but Piper was determined.The teenager had been working at a backpacker's hostel for the past six weeks, and told friends she was going for a 05:00 morning swim on Monday, Australian media reported.Her body was found around 06:30 local time (20:30 GMT on Sunday).She was found near the Maheno shipwreck, which was washed ashore in 1935 and is now a popular tourist landmark.The area is known for its population of dingoes, a wild species of native dog that is protected in Queensland national parks.About 200 dingoes live on World Heritage-listed K'Gari, according to the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.",

While the watchmaker has not disclosed the price, industry collective Watchopea estimates its value at $1.5m (£1.1m, 137m rupees).The centre - branded as a private wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre - is home to more than 2,000 species, including lions, elephants and tigers, and is spread over 3,500 acres. The zoo, which is owned by Anant and is not open to the public, hit the headlines last year after allegations of unlawfully acquiring and mistreating animals, but a Supreme Court-appointed team later found no evidence of wrongdoing.AFP via Getty ImagesAnant Ambani and wife Radhika Merchant's pre-wedding bash was held at VantaraIt is located in Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, not far from Mukesh Ambani's oil refinery - which is the largest in the world.Vantara was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March last year.It was also one of the venues for Anant Ambani's lavish 2024 pre-wedding events that made global headlines.The wedding and other events were attended by all of India's top Bollywood stars and global celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Rihanna.

It said the watch was made up of 397 precious stones, including diamonds, green sapphires, garnets and other gems.An executive associated with the brand's India retail partner Ethos Watches told the BBC that the company has not disclosed the price of the watch.

    "body": "6 hours agoCaroline DaviesPakistan correspondentThe death toll in a fire which engulfed a shopping centre in Pakistan has climbed to 67, police have confirmed.Police say 77 people are currently reported as missing by their families following the fire at Gul Plaza, in Pakistan's largest city Karachi, on Saturday evening.But the scale of the damage following the blaze - which took more than 24 hours to put out - has slowed rescue efforts, as authorities comb the remains of the 6,500sq m (70,000 sq ft) complex.While some of the bodies found are only partial remains, authorities had been able to count 67 skulls, the deputy commissioner of police told the BBC. The process to identify the bodies continues, with 15 people identified so far.Gul Plaza had housed some 1,200 shops, spread across multiple floors. It is wedding season in Karachi, often a particularly busy time of year for shoppers.While the cause of the fire is still unknown, witnesses earlier told the BBC that a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster.Shop owner Rehan Faisal recounted how it only took about \"five to seven minutes\" for everything to \"burn before our eyes\".\"Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs. I was just beginning to comprehend the situation when the shop owner told me to lock up and get out,\" he told BBC Urdu.With the facility due to close soon, most of the gates of the shopping centre were locked, witnesses said.Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHafizullah Maroof,BBC AfghanandFlora DruryA 22-year-old Afghan woman who was reportedly running a taekwondo gym for girls has been released after spending 13 days in jail, a spokesman for the Taliban's supreme court confirmed.Khadija Ahmadzada was detained for being in \"violation\" of rules \"regarding women's sports gyms\", a spokesman for the Taliban's ministry of vice and virtue told the BBC.Sports clubs have been closed to women since 2021, shortly after the Taliban returned to power.At the time, it was said they would reopen once a \"safe environment\" - which does not contravene the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic law - had been established.As of January 2026, no sports club has reopened, while women are still unable to compete.It is one of a raft of measures that have been imposed on women by the Taliban since 2021, which have seen their rights to education and work curtailed as well as strict rules around clothing imposed.Ahmadzada, who lives near the western city of Herat, was detained with a number of other people after \"violations were observed\" by vice and virtue inspectors, the ministry spokesman said. She was accused of not wearing \"a proper hijab\", \"playing music\" and allowing genders to mix in her gym and sentenced to 13 days in jail. The spokesman said she had been given multiple warnings.The case was then referred to the supreme court, which announced she would be released on Thursday 22 January. It is unclear where she is now.News of Ahmadzada's arrest led to an outcry on social media, attracting the attention of Richard Bennett, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, who posted online calling for her immediate release.He also highlighted the case of female journalist Nazira Rashidi, in the northern city of Kunduz, who was detained in late December. Taliban spokesmen deny her detention is related to her work as a journalist, according to local media.",

    "body": "'I saw people getting shot': Eyewitness tells of Iran protest crackdown48 minutes agoSoroush PakzadParniaParnia was visiting family in Isfahan when the protests beganWarning: This story contains details which some readers might find distressing.An Iranian woman who witnessed the bloody crackdown on protests in Iran has described how her neighbourhood turned into a \"war zone\" as security forces opened fire at crowds with live ammunition.A government-imposed internet blackout in Iran, now in its third week, has prevented many accounts of what has happened from reaching the wider world.But some Iranians who have left the country have been able to share what they have seen.Parnia, who lives in London, told the BBC that she was visiting her family in the central city of Isfahan when the protests broke out in the capital, Tehran. They quickly spread across the country, and within days there were hundreds of protesters in the Hakim Nezami and Khaghani neighbourhoods of Isfahan.\"There were women and men from seven to 70 years old,\" she said. \"On just one street there were 200 to 300 people. People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'.\" The \"dictator\" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency.First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot.\"I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street.\"Parnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman. Inside, she said, were many injured protesters.\"I saw the lobby floor covered in blood, and I saw a girl whose leg was full of pellets.\"Videos verified by the BBC from that night show large numbers of people in the streets in Isfahan. Some streets were blocked by traffic sign poles and large metal sheets, in an apparent effort by protesters to protect themselves from gunfire.Footage also showed protesters breaking through the gates of the building of the national broadcaster Irib, which was later set on fire.Phone footageThe building of the state broadcaster in Isfahan was set on fireOn Friday morning, 9 January, Khamenei said Iran would not back down from dealing with what he called \"destructive elements\", a day after US President Donald Trump had threatened to hit Iran \"very hard\" if authorities started killing people.Following Khamenei's speech, the powerful Revolutionary Guards sent a text message to people across Iran, telling them to avoid gatherings on streets in areas of unrest. The messages also warned against co-operating with what it described as \"terrorist mercenaries\" - an act it said would constitute treason.Despite the risks, Parnia went out to protest again on Friday evening.\"The protesters were hopeful,\" she said. \"You could see fear on everyone's faces. We were afraid to pass in front of the security forces and come closer together,\" she said.\"We thought even if we get killed, it would be a reason for Trump to act faster.\"Footage obtained by the BBC from the previous day shows large crowds on main streets in Parnia's neighbourhood. But she said on the Friday it was different.Phone footageHundreds of people gathered on the streets of Isfahan to protest\"Protesters were in small groups gathered in alleyways. Every time that someone tried to gather in the larger street, we could hear live fire sound followed by screams and shouts.\"Because of the internet blackouts, and protesters avoiding taking their phones with them, the BBC has not yet obtained footage from Friday night.Parnia also described a scene of \"total chaos\" at a local clinic that was treating wounded protesters.\"No phone lines were working. Nobody could call their families, and many refused to go to hospitals, fearing they could be arrested there,\" she said. \"All the nurses could do was clean the wounds and send them home. The next day you could still smell the tear gasses in the air. Security forces were present and there were checkpoints across the city.\"Parnia left Isfahan that same day and travelled to the capital, Tehran, to catch a flight back to London.\"I arrived in Tehran at 6pm. All the shops were closed and many people gathered in the streets. At 8pm everyone started to chant and I could hear gunshots,\" she said.\"The airport was so busy. Many foreign airlines were cancelled and people were frustrated. Luckily, I found an Iranian flight to leave.\"Since her return to the UK, Parnia has been in touch with her friends in Isfahan.She said she learned from a source that doctors at Feiz eye hospital in Isfahan had carried out around 300 surgical procedures to remove the eyes of patients with birdshot-related facial injuries.\"Every time you go out into the streets, you see random people with eye patches,\" Parnia's friends told her.According to several health workers who spoke to the BBC, hospitals are monitored and controlled by security forces, and people with gunshot wounds in Isfahan are being arrested.\"Many of the injured are developing infections. Some doctors are referring them to surgeons who can treat them in private clinics,\" Parnia's cited her friends as saying.While Iranian authorities have said around 3,000 people were killed during the protests, US-based human rights group HRANA has so far confirmed more than 4,600 deaths, with another 9,700 cases still under review. According to the group, at least 7,300 people have also sustained serious injuries. Many believe the true figures may be even higher.Parnia said she was now preparing to join Iranian opposition protests in the UK, saying she wants to be a voice for the silenced protesters.She also expressed anger at international media reports suggesting that Iranians and the country's political opposition was not united.\"Iranians have shown what they want in the streets and paid a high price for it.\"",

    "body": "Mandela's prison key, sunglasses and shirt can be sold after daughter wins court battleA South African court has dismissed an appeal by the country's heritage body to stop the sale and export of various artefacts connected to anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela.The 70 personal items include a cell key from Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 of the 27 years he was locked up, a pair of Aviator sunglasses and one of his signature floral shirts. They were due to be exported to the US for auction.The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration. In trying to stop their sale, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export.The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m).The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa.Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former resident's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province.In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argues that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad.The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were.It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment.Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming \"to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family\".\"Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name,\" she said.She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction.Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations.Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects.Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He led the African National Congress in its struggle against apartheid - a system of legally enforced racism - and was released from prison in 1990.He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with then-President FW de Klerk.Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994.",

    "body": "More than 160 million Americans are expected to face an unusually brutal winter storm from Friday, with heavy snows and freezing rains forecast.The storm is expected to sweep through much of the United States, leaving \"extremely dangerous\" conditions in its wake as it tracks eastwards from the High Plains and Rockies, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.It warned that the Arctic blast will bring sub-zero temperatures and wind chills, which \"pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin\".US transportation officials, including airport authorities in several major cities, have warned of weekend travel disruption, delays and cancellations.The winter storm is forecast to move slowly across the US, blanketing cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York with snow.Heavy snow is predicted through the Southern Rockies and Plains, into the Mid-Atlantic and reaching the Northeast.According to the NWS Probabilistic Precipitation Portal, the regions that could see more than a foot of snow stretch from Colorado to West Virginia to Boston.Numerous low temperature records are likely to be broken, according to the NWS, with the coldest wind chills potentially falling below -50F (-46C) across the Northern Plains. A much wider area of the south-eastern US is also forecast to experience freezing temperatures.Governors in several US states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, have declared states of emergency, allowing emergency officials - including National Guard troops - to begin mobilising response efforts.Some airlines have offered passengers the option to change their flights, in some cases without incurring extra fees, due to concerns about cancellations.Motorists should avoid driving across the weekend, with travel expected to be \"nearly impossible during the peak of the storm\", NWS meteorologists Rich Otto and Tony Fracasso told the BBC's US news partner CBS.In Canada, freezing temperatures are already gripping the country, with snowfall expected in eastern and Atlantic regions on Monday, meteorologist Geoff Coulson told CBC earlier in the week.",

    "body": "The head of South Sudan's armed forces has given soldiers seven days to \"crush the rebellion\" in the east that is a potential threat to the capital, Juba.Recently, the Sudan People's Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA-IO) has attacked and captured several areas in Jonglei state, a local journalist told the BBC, though this could not be independently verified. The latest fighting has threatened Jonglei's capital, Bor, two hours' drive from Juba.SPLA-IO's leader, suspended First Vice-President Riek Machar, is currently on trial on charges of murder, treason and crimes against humanity, which he denies.There are fears that the fighting could re-ignite a full-blown civil war in the country.Conflict in South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, broke out in 2013, two years after independence, when President Salva Kiir accused Machar of plotting to overthrow him.A 2018 peace deal ended the civil war that had killed nearly 400,000 people, but it has never been properly implemented and the relationship between Kiir and Machar has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.Reinforcements from the South Sudanese army have now been deployed to Bor, which was the first place to be captured by opposition forces in the 2013-2018 conflict. The town is seen as a strategic staging post on the way to the capital.\"We brought you here for a mission,\" chief of the defence force Gen Paul Nang Majok told his troops.\"I am giving you seven days only to finish the mission – to crush the rebellion in those areas and recapture them.\"The South Sudanese army is being supported by soldiers from Uganda. Their exact number is not known. One report put the figure at 4,000, but this has not been confirmed.The soldiers are now preparing to advance into the areas held by SPLA-IO forces, national broadcaster SSBC has reported.Analysts believe the threats by the SPLA-IO forces to advance towards Juba with the aim of occupying it are meant to put pressure on the government to release Machar.Earlier this week, Kiir sacked Machar's wife, Angelina Teny, from her position as interior minister in the unity government and replaced her with someone from his own party. The move sparked criticism and worries that it could escalate the conflict.The UN's peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Jonglei and other areas experiencing violence in the country.Unmiss acting head of mission Kiki Gbeho urged the leaders of South Sudan to commit to \"immediately ceasing hostilities, de-escalating tensions, and advancing reconciliation and peace through inclusive dialogue under the framework of the peace agreement\".The UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan also expressed alarm at the deteriorating political and security situation and had a similar message to Unmiss.Commission chair Yasmin Sooka expressed deep alarm at the reports of repeated airstrikes in parts of Jonglei, which have killed and injured civilians, destroyed homes, markets and medical facilities, and triggered large-scale displacement.Earlier this month, SPLA-IO acting chief of staff, Lt Gen Peter Thok Chuol Luak, issued a warning to Juba's residents, saying its forces would launch attacks near the city.\"This warning precedes imminent military confrontations in Juba. We strongly recommend that all South Sudanese citizens in areas on the outskirts of Juba either evacuate or remain indoors,\" Gen Thok wrote.The governor of the state that includes Juba, Emmanuel Adil Anthony, has urged residents to ignore the threats made by the SPLA-IO.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBalla Satish,HyderabadandAbhishek Dey,GuwahatiAuthorities in the southern Indian state of Telangana have launched an investigation after hundreds of stray dogs were killed across at least six villages in the past month.Police say they have confirmed at least 354 killings so far and arrested nine people in connection with some of the cases.Animal welfare activists have told the BBC that the dogs were either poisoned or given lethal injections, but police say they are waiting for forensic reports to establish the method used.Villagers have said that the killings were linked to promises made by candidates during recent local election campaigns to get rid of stray dogs and monkeys.The killings have come at a time when India is witnessing a larger debate about stray animals and the country's top court is hearing petitions about how to rid the city streets, including in the capital Delhi, of stray dogs. But killings on such a large scale are rare and have elicited outrage. Stray animals - mostly dogs but also cattle and monkeys - are considered a persistent problem in many parts of India, where they are often blamed for attacks on people, crop damage and traffic accidents.The problem is attributed to a combination of factors, including gaps in sterilisation and vaccination programmes, rubbish piling up, abandonment of animals, shrinking forest habitats and uneven enforcement of laws. While stray dogs, in particular, are often enmeshed in the fabric of daily life, forming strong bonds with local communities, animal rights activists have frequently flagged cruelty towards them, warning that the country does not have strong enough penalties. Telangana state minister Danasari Anasuya Seethakka told the Hindu newspaper that the killings were \"illegal\" and \"inhumane\", warning that those responsible would face strict action.The issue of how to handle stray dogs is also being debated at present in the Supreme Court.In August last year, the court ordered authorities in Delhi and its suburbs to move all stray dogs from streets to animal shelters in just two months. After widespread protests, the court modified the order, asking for the animals to be immunised and vaccinated before being released back to their neighbourhoods.Animal welfare groups argue that putting dogs into already-overburdened shelters is unscientific, while those seeking removal of stray dogs from public places say unchecked populations is endangering people's lives and livelihoods.The killings in Telangana were spread across three districts and occurred between late December and mid-January. Police say they may have taken place over several days in each location.In Kamareddy district, \"244 dogs died and were buried in four locations\", S Anil, a police sub-inspector, told BBC Telugu. \"Government veterinary doctors have conducted post-mortems and sent samples to the lab,\" said Anil, adding that council heads of three villages were found to be involved.In Shayampet and Arepally villages near Telangana's Warangal city, police say 110 dogs were killed. Police sub-inspector J Parameshwar told BBC Telugu that nine people, including village council heads, have been arrested.In Jagtial city, police are investigating a complaint that around 40 dogs were killed on 28 and 30 December but no bodies had been recovered so far.Minister Seethakka told the Hindu newspaper that killing stray dogs under the pretext of population control could not be justified under any circumstances.The government has issued clear instructions to all village councils to prevent a recurrence of such incidents, she added.Animal welfare activists allege that the number of dogs that have been culled is much higher than what the police have confirmed so far.Some residents, however, have defended the killings.Raju (who goes by just his first name), the son of the Arepally village head, told the BBC that only rabid dogs were killed, saying they were diseased, aggressive and had caused road accidents and serious injuries. Another resident, Vijay (goes by first name), said most villagers supported the decision, citing fears of dog bites and disease.Telangana recorded nearly 122,000 dog bite cases in 2024, according to federal government records, but no dog bite-related rabies deaths were recorded in the same period.The dog killings have coincided with other alleged incidents involving stray animals in Telangana, including a case reported by The Times of India in which several monkeys were found dead or critically injured after being allegedly tranquillised and dumped along a highway in Kamareddy district.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

    "body": "11 hours agoJude Sheerin,WashingtonandHelen SullivanReutersUS President Donald Trump has withdrawn an invitation for Canada to join his newly constituted Board of Peace, in the latest spat between the North American neighbours.\"Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining,\" Trump said on Truth Social in a post addressed to Prime Minister Mark Carney, who made headlines this week when he warned of a \"rupture\" in the US-led global order. Canada had indicated that while it would not pay to be on the board, it would join. Meanwhile, EU chief Antonio Costa said European leaders have serious doubts about the scope of the board, but were willing to work with the body in Gaza.The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.Trump did not give a reason in Thursday evening's post as to why he had decided to revoke Canada's offer. Carney's office did not immediately respond. The prime minster had indicated last week he would accept Trump's offer on principle.But Ottawa had indicated in recent days that it would not pay the $1bn (£740m) membership fee which Trump has said permanent members will be asked to pay to help fund the board.Trump's Board of Peace was originally thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. BBC looks into who is and isn't on Trump's Board of PeaceBut its proposed charter does not mention the Palestinian territory and appears to be designed to supplant functions of the UN. Trump would be chairman for life.Some 60 nations have been invited to join the board and about 35 have already signed up, according to the White House.Those who have agreed to join so far include Argentina, Belarus, Morocco, Vietnam, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kosovo, Hungary, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Jordan, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.But none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.The UK has expressed concerns about the inclusion of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces are fighting in Ukraine after invading in 2022. France said the charter as it currently stood was \"incompatible\" with its international commitments, especially its UN membership.European Council president Antonio Costa said European leaders have doubts about the scope of the board, but were ready to work with the US and the newly founded body in Gaza.Speaking on Friday after an EU leaders' summit in Brussels, Costa said, \"We have serious doubts about a number of elements in the charter of the Board of Peace related to its scope, its governance and its compatibility with the UN Charter.\"But he said the EU was \"ready to work together with the US on the implementation of the comprehensive Peace Plan for Gaza, with a Board of Peace carrying out its mission as a transitional administration\".After the EU leaders' summit, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters that his country had \"declined\" the invitation to participate in the body.Watch: Board of Peace, Zelensky and Musk - What happened before Trump left Davos?Trump's withdrawal of Canada's invitation came after Carney appeared to irk Trump with a speech that won a rare standing ovation this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos.The prime minister urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", although he did not mention the US president by name.A day later Trump told the gathering in the Swiss Alpine resort that Canada gets many \"freebies\" from the US and it \"should be grateful\".\"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said. \"Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"On Thursday, Carney swiped back at Trump as he delivered another speech back on home turf.Speaking in Quebec, he said: \"Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadians.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Trump covets mineral-rich Greenland, but what natural resources does it actually have?4 hours agoArchie MitchellandDanielle Kaye,Business reportersGetty ImagesDonald Trump has made clear he covets Greenland.Now he claims to have secured the \"framework\" of a future deal, to address defence on the island - a deal that he says includes rights to rare earth minerals.So what natural resources does Greenland have?Greenland is believed to sit on top of large reserves of oil and natural gas.It is also said to be home to the vast majority of raw materials considered crucial for electronics, green energy and other strategic and military technologies – to which Trump has been pushing to secure America's access.Overall, 25 of 34 minerals deemed \"critical raw materials\" by the European Commission are found in Greenland, including graphite, niobium and titanium, according to the 2023 Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.Greenland's strategic importance is \"not just about defence\", Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said at a Senate hearing last year about the potential acquisition of Greenland, pointing to the island's \"vast reserves of rare earth elements\".Trump has sometimes downplayed the importance of those resources, pointing to what he claims is rising Russian and Chinese influence in the region to justify his claims that the US has to \"have\" the island.\"I want Greenland for security - I don't want it for anything else,\" he told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, pointing in part to the difficulty of exploring in the Arctic region. \"You have to go 25ft down through ice to get it. It's not, it's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do.\"But access to the island's natural resources have loomed large in the background for the administration, which has put the US economy at the centre of its geopolitical vision and has made combatting China's dominance of the rare earths industry a priority.   Trump's interest in controlling Greenland is \"primarily about access to those resources, and blocking China's access\", according to Steven Lamy, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California.Even before Trump's second term, the US had been tightening its ties with Greenland, including by reopening its consulate in the island's capital, Nuuk, in 2020, responding to Russia and China's expanding military presence in the Arctic.Since Trump returned to office, his allies have talked up the island's commercial potential, as rising temperatures expand sea routes and opportunities to explore the region's fisheries and other natural resources, especially those related to defence, such as energy and critical minerals, that the administration sees as a priority.\"This is about shipping lanes. This is about energy. This is about fisheries. And, of course, it's about your mission, which is keeping us safe and monitoring space, monitoring our adversaries, and making sure the American people can sleep safely in their homes, day in and day out,\" Mike Waltz, the current US ambassador to the United Nations and then Trump's national security adviser, told US troops stationed in Greenland last year.And Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry told CNBC this month that Trump was a \"business president\" who believed the island represented \"a more robust trading opportunity\".Over the summer, the Trump administration signed off on the possibility of backing an American company's mining project in Greenland, via $120m (£90m) in financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.The plan built on other deals the Trump administration has agreed with Australia and Japan, as well as private firms, to secure US access to supply and production of rare earths, an industry now dominated by China.Dr Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said the scale of Greenland's critical minerals holdings had the potential to \"shift the dial\" for the US, allowing it to reduce its reliance on China - a key priority for the administration.But critics of Trump's designs on the island, say it is not clear why US control would be necessary to access the island's resources. Analysts also warn that tapping them is easier said than done.Among other challenges, mining in Greenland currently is expensive and hampered by severe weather conditions, a lack of infrastructure and a small labour force, Lamy said.While exploration permits have been given for 100 blocs of the island, there are just two productive mines in Greenland.\"Greenland has been trying to attract outside investments into its extractive industries for a long time, and has not had a lot of luck because the business case just hasn't really been there,\" said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies.\"It's true that there are huge quantities of minerals of various kinds in Greenland. However, it also costs a lot of money to extract those minerals.\"But Prof Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said rapidly melting layers of ice are increasingly easing the process, exposing rock for potential mining and creating river runoff.\"Getting all the fieldwork done traditionally has been very hard to do because you have to get energy to remote regions,\" he told the BBC.\"With the melting ice, you get the potential for hydro power in the area where the land is being exposed… so this presents itself as an interesting prospect.\"Jennifer Spence, director of the Arctic Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School, said when it came to mining in Greenland, \"it's all still about potential\". Still, she thinks the island's strategic shipping location and rare earths deposits were key factors drawing Trump's attention. \"His logic is that there's a national security imperative,\" Spence said. \"My belief is that this is much more economically driven.\"Additional reporting by Natalie Sherman",

    "body": "1 day agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, BeirutAFPSyrian government forces advanced rapidly into north-eastern Syria in recent daysPresident Ahmed al-Sharaa has made significant advances in his efforts to unify a deeply fractured Syria, reclaiming large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under the control of a Kurdish-led militia alliance for more than a decade. What happens next will be a test for a government that has tried to assert its authority over the whole country.The gains by government forces in a lightning offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) marked the biggest change of control in Syria since Islamist-led rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending the 13-year civil war. Before this month's push, nearly a third of Syria's territory was controlled by the Kurds, who enjoyed American support after helping a US-led coalition defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in the last decade. There, they ran an enclave with its own government and institutions, with the SDF being its military arm.EPAPresident Ahmed al-Sharaa signed a 14-point agreement with the SDF on SundayThe offensive came amid stalled talks between Sharaa's government and the SDF about the key issue of integrating its forces into the country's institutions. A deal was signed last March, but a year-end deadline expired with little progress as the SDF remained reluctant to give up its autonomy. The militia alliance, analysts say, miscalculated in its negotiations with the government, seeming to believe it would have the backing of its longtime ally.But the US under President Donald Trump has strongly supported Sharaa, who has defended his vision of a united Syria under the control of Damascus. Trump hosted Sharaa, who was once branded a terrorist by the US for his former links to al-Qaeda, at the White House last year, and lifted devastating sanctions imposed on Syria in the Assad years. When Sharaa's forces started their push, there was no apparent US objection.AFPSyrian Kurds stand to lose the autonomy they enjoyed for more than a decade On Sunday, after suffering stunning territorial losses, the SDF agreed on a 14-point deal that reversed almost all concessions it had gained from the government in earlier negotiations. Crucially, its members are expected to join the Syrian army and interior ministry as individuals - and not as separate units, as it had demanded - while the control of oil and gas fields, important for Syria's economic recovery, will be transferred to the government. SDF-run prisons and camps holding thousands of IS detainees and family members are also being brought under Damascus' control.The announcement came days after Sharaa issued a decree that was seen as an attempt to reach out to the Kurds, whose rights had been denied in the five-decade rule by the Assads: it designated Kurdish as a national language, granted Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declared the Nowruz - the Persian new year - a national holiday.Fighting, however, erupted again. So far, the areas reclaimed by government forces have been mainly Arab, where locals had resentments against the SDF. But the troops continued to move towards Kurdish-majority areas, raising the prospect of deadly clashes, and reportedly angering Washington. On Tuesday, Sharaa's government suddenly announced a ceasefire, giving the SDF four days to present a detailed plan for the integration of areas under its control into the state. This halted the move of his army and prevented the escalation of the violence, for now.EPAGovernment forces took control of al-Hol camp for IS families after SDF fighters withdrewSince coming to power after the fall of the Assad regime, Sharaa has repeatedly vowed to protect Syria's minorities. But the country has seen deadly bouts of sectarian violence. Last year, government forces were accused of atrocities after being sent to the Mediterranean coast, which is the heartland of Assad's Alawite sect, and the mainly Druze southern province of Suweida. Kurds fear the same could happen to them, despite renewed guarantees offered by Sharaa.For the Kurds, the losses are a fatal blow to the aspirations of preserving their autonomy, with the US position being seen as a betrayal. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy, said the \"original purpose\" of the partnership with the SDF, as the main anti-IS force in Syria, had \"largely expired\", and that the \"greatest opportunity for the Kurds in Syria\" lay in the transition under Sharaa, whose government is seen by Western countries as the best chance to guarantee Syria's stability.The dramatic changes empower Sharaa but are likely to renew calls for him to decentralise authority, with critics saying key posts have been limited to his allies. It could also indicate what he may be planning to do in other areas of the country, including those held by the Druze, who demand autonomy.",

    "body": "8 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business Correspondent, SingaporeGetty ImagesOne in seven people in the world use TikTok. Yet for the company behind such a cultural phenomenon, the last few years have been a rollercoaster.Concerns over the app first surfaced more than five years ago, prompting President Trump, in his first term, to sign an executive order aimed at removing TikTok from US stores.Lawmakers were worried that the Chinese government could access user data of the 200 million Americans who use the app and possibly manipulate their feeds.To address these concerns, TikTok's parent company ByteDance launched Project Texas – storing US user data on domestic servers run by American-owned Oracle. The company also moved its headquarters to Singapore and Los Angeles – in part to distance itself from its Chinese roots.These were seen as significant concessions at the time. But still, in 2024 Congress passed a law threatening to ban the app outright, unless ByteDance transferred majority ownership and changed how TikTok operates in the US.That deal has now closed with ByteDance signing an agreement to split the US app from the rest of its global business under a new consortium of companies that includes Oracle.TikTok remains alive in a critical market, but the terms underline the compromises and limits that ByteDance - and perhaps other Chinese tech firms - may face as they try to expand globally.How did we get here?The US-China rivalry has seen Washington and Beijing crack down on each other's firms over national security concerns.Yet in the the most recent trade war TikTok became \"low hanging fruit\" that China could offer in exchange for other important concessions, like American agricultural products.The deal allows China to frame the outcome as a win - exporting tech on its own terms while gaining leverage in broader trade negotiations.ByteDance will retain access to America's 200 million users and 7.5 million businesses, but it loses control over TikTok's algorithm and data.Instead, the company will licence the algorithm to the new US entity, in a deal the Trump administration has valued at $14bn (£10bn).\"TikTok's power lies in its content graph - an algorithm that learns from thousands of user signals to deliver hyper‑relevant, highly addictive videos,\" said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester.\"With a US joint venture retraining that algorithm on domestic data, the experience will change... One thing's certain: TikTok in America won't be the same.\"This shift could have knock on effects for advertisers and creators because of the changes. Creators may see their engagement shrink especially because global virality will take a hit – previously content that took off in one region could become popular in the US organically. A US-only algorithm could weaken that, forcing brands to re-structure deals and perhaps having to pay more for US exposure.TikTok's global revenue was estimated to be $20-26bn in 2024, roughly $10 billion of which came from the US with advertising accounting for a large share.The changes will likely hurt TikTok's bottom line in the US, but ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake and therefore a share of the profits.The retraining of the algorithm might also have consequences for ByteDance's technology development.Running separate US and global algorithms, split workforces, and parallel governance adds engineering costs, slows innovation, and adds to the operational complexity, says Charlie Dai Principal Analyst in Technology Architecture & Delivery at Forrester.The India experienceByteDance has faced political and regulatory hurdles before.The loss of India in 2020 - then TikTok's largest market, with 200 million users - was a far bigger setback than any potential disruption in the US, says Chris Stokel-Walker, author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World's Favourite App.But, he says, even the India \"setback\" wasn't much of a setback. \"They've continued to show growth despite these challenges.\"The struggles in both the US and India share a common thread: they were triggered by geopolitical tensions.The India ban, however, was not aimed at TikTok alone - it targeted China more broadly, with roughly 200 apps blocked across the country. And while that ban opened the door for homegrown platforms to emerge, none have come close to matching TikTok's success.Getty ImagesTikTok CEO Shou Chew will be a director in the new US ventureFor some, the TikTok deal inevitably invites comparisons with Huawei – another Chinese tech champion whose global ambitions have been reshaped by geopolitics.But there are stark differences, Huawei has been effectively locked out of Western markets after US sanctions cut off access to critical 5G infrastructure.TikTok by contrast has been allowed to remain, albeit on restrictive terms for ByteDance.Chris Stokel-Walker says this reflects a shift in how governments are responding to Chinese technology companies.Some are excluded altogether; others are permitted to operate, but only within tightly defined political and regulatory limits.A homegrown championWhile TikTok is being reshaped abroad, it has full control over Douyin – its Chinese sister app – which is hugely successful in its own right within China.Douyin forms a core pillar of ByteDance's business – it is profitable, politically aligned and able to innovate because it is in charge of training the algorithm on data it has full access to.But ByteDance is also hedging its bets for the future, investing in data centres, the cloud and Artificial Intelligence, underscoring the company's efforts to diversify beyond advertising-led consumer apps.Chris Stokel-Walker argues that TikTok's predicament is no longer really about data security, but about who controls speech, culture and influence in the US.Trump has never liked that China might be shaping American culture, he says.The reality is that ByteDance will continue to operate TikTok in the US, but with distinct limitations. And this could spill over into other markets it plans to expand in with regulators looking for more control over Chinese technology.Other experts have said the licensing aspect of the deal could form a template for how other Chinese tech companies expand globally in an environment of increasing mistrust of Beijing.",

Prosecutors believe the fire started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached set light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling. The two bar managers have been placed under criminal investigation, but not in custody. French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.In their first statement since the fire, they said they were \"devastated\" and pledged \"full co-operation\" with the investigation.Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but the mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, said on Tuesday he could not explain why it hadn't been checked in so long. \"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.ReutersRicardo Minghetti, whose funeral was held on Wednesday, was one of eight victims under the age of 16More on this storyMost of the victims of the fire were young - eight under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns and are being treated in Switzerland and other European countries.The funerals of some of those who died have been taking place.Watch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor saysUnder Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities.

    "body": "1 day agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondentNvidia has unveiled a new tech platform for self-driving cars as the world's leading chip-maker seeks more physical products to embed AI into.Speaking at the annual CES technology conference in Las Vegas, boss Jensen Huan said the system - called Alpamayo - would bring \"reasoning\" to autonomous vehicles.That would allow cars to \"think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,\" Huang claimed.He said Nvidia was working with Mercedes to produce a driverless car powered by the tech, which would be released in the US in the coming months before being rolled out in Europe and Asia.Nvidia's chips have helped power the AI revolution, though so far attention has mostly been focussed on the software it powers, such as ChatGPT.However, leading tech firms are now increasingly looking for hardware - meaning physical products such as cars - that AI could be used in.Wearing his trademark black leather jacket, Huang told an audience of hundreds that the project has taught Nvidia \"an enormous amount\" about how to help partners build robotic systems. \"The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is almost here,\" Huang said.\"NVIDIA's pivot toward AI at scale and AI systems as differentiators will help keep it way ahead of rivals,\" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, from Las Vegas.\"Alpamayo represents a profound shift for NVIDIA, moving from being primarily a compute to a platform provider for physical AI ecosystems.\"Shares of the AI chip designer rose slightly in after-hours trading following Huang's presentation.It featured a video demonstration of the AI-powered Mercedes-Benz driving through San Francisco while a passenger, sat behind the steering wheel, kept their hands in their lap.\"It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,\" Huang said, \"but in every single scenario... it tells you what it's going to do, and it reasons about what it's about to do.\"Alpamayo is an open-source AI model, with the underlying code now available on machine learning platform Hugging Face, where autonomous vehicle researchers can access it for free and retrain the model, Huang said. \"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" he told the audience.The project could pose a threat to companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, which offers driver assistance software called Autopilot.\"Well that's just exactly what Tesla is doing,\" Musk posted on social media following the Alpamayo announcement. \"What they will find is that it's easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.\"Like Tesla, Nvidia also has plans to launch a robotaxi service by next year in collaboration with a partner, but has declined to name the partner or say where it will be.Nvidia is the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of more than $4.5tn (£3.3tn). It became the first company to reach $5tn in October, but has lost value over concerns about whether demand AI is overhyped.The company also revealed that its Rubin AI chips are currently being manufactured and are due for release later this year.The highly-anticipated hardware can compute using less energy than Nvidia's current line of AI chips, and could drive down the cost of developing the technology.",

    "body": "An employee at Japan's nuclear safety agency lost his work phone containing sensitive information during a personal trip to China, Japanese media report.The phone contained confidential contact details of staff involved in nuclear security work at the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA). The agency could not confirm if the data was leaked, reports say.The incident comes as Japan attempts to revive its atomic energy programme, which has been stalled for more than a decade.Japan ordered all its nuclear power plant reactors to be shut down in 2011 after a magnitude 9 earthquake and massive tsunami caused a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant.The NRA was formed after the Fukushima nuclear disaster to oversee nuclear safety, including the restarting of the country's reactors.The NRA employee is believed to have lost his work phone on 3 November while undergoing a security check at a Shanghai airport on a personal trip.He noticed the phone was missing three days later and, despite checking with the airport, did not recover it.The NRA issues smartphones to certain employees so they can respond promptly to emergencies, the Asahi newspaper reported.According to Kyodo News, the affected NRA department deals with protecting nuclear materials from threats like theft and terrorism at the country's facilities.The NRA reported the incident to the country's Personal Information Protection Commission and has warned employees against bringing work phones overseas, local media reported.This is not the first time that Japan's nuclear officials have made headlines for security lapses.In 2023, an employee at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant—the world's largest nuclear facility—lost a stack of documents after placing it on top of their car and driving off.Last November, another employee at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant was found to have mishandled confidential documents by making copies of them and locking them in a desk.And this week, Chubu Electric Power, a nuclear plant operator in central Japan, said it might have used cherry-picked data during safety screenings for its nuclear plant.The NRA has since suspended its review for Chubu to restart its reactors, citing the \"fabrication of critical inspection data\", Reuters reported.",

    "body": "20 hours agoOlivia IrelandWatch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor saysThe Swiss bar that was the scene of a fire which killed 40 people and injured 116 had not undergone safety checks for five years, authorities have said.The mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, told a Tuesday news conference that he could not explain why Le Constellation bar had not been checked in so long, but that the council was \"profoundly sorry\". The venues should have been checked annually.\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019.Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: \"I have no answer for you today.\"\"We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families.\" \"I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to,\" he later added. Feraud said it would be \"down to the judges\" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors.ReutersPeople in the area have been leaving tributes to the victims of the deadly New Year's Day fireWhen the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate.Feraud said the maximum capacity was 200 people, with emergency exits designed to cater for 100 people on each side of its two levels. However he did not know if the exit on the basement level was working.Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers under criminal investigation, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said.Prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar. Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. Swiss national broadcaster RTS has shown footage from 2019 of partygoers holding bottles with sparklers. An employee warns them to be careful of the \"mousse\" - the French word for the acoustics foam panelling. Questioned on the video, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images and he wished it had been brought to his attention at the time as he would have investigated. More on this storyFeraud said while inspections of the facility were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2019, there were none from 2020 to 2025. He told the press conference in 2015 the owners renovated the bar and it did not require a permit, which was when the sound insulation foam was stuck on the ceiling. \"There were never any checks on this soundproofing foam. Our security agents did not consider it necessary,\" Feraud said. Investigators will be assessing several elements, including the nature of the foam, compliance with standards for access and emergency exits in the basement. Accounts from reported scenes include that people pushed and shoved, notably on the staircase leading to the basement. Under Swiss regulations, doors are required to open in the direction of the exit and be clearly signposted. Under Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities. The Crans-Montana's failure to adhere to fire safety regulations by not inspecting Le  Constellation from 2020 to 2025 may point to a potential fault with the system. ",

He previously described his arrest as politically motivated.The lawyer, who is married to Buhari‘s third child, Nana Hadiza, recently left the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to join the opposition African Democratic Congress, which is viewed as the biggest rival to the APC in the 2027 general elections.Malami is one of several ministers in the Buhari administration accused of corruption, including another influential figure, Hadi Sirika, who was in charge of the country’s aviation ministry.In court on Wednesday, presiding judge Emeka Nwite stated that the charges against the defendants were bailable offences.He said they could be released on bail set at 500 million naira (£260,000; $350,000) each. They must also provide two guarantors who own property in designated parts of the capital, Abuja, and surrender their travel documents to the court.The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alleges that the former minister used his office to divert government funds, which were then used to acquire properties in several Nigerian cities, including Abuja.The case has been adjourned until 17 February 2025.",

    "body": "Doug LaMalfa, a Republican Congressman from California, has died unexpectedly at age 65, colleagues announced on Tuesday.President Donald Trump offered a tribute to LaMalfa, saying he wanted \"to express our tremendous sorrow at the loss of a great member - a great, great, great member\".The  congressman's cause of death was not immediately clear. LaMalfa was a former rice farmer elected to congress in 2013. He focused on water and agriculture issues during his tenure. His death shaved an already-thin Republican majority in the US House of Representatives to just a few seats, following the resignation on Monday of former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"He was a fantastic person,\" Trump said. \"He voted with me 100% of the time.\"Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer called his colleague a \"staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America\".LaMalfa earned a degree in agriculture business from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. He served as a state lawmaker before being elected to congress, where he fought for help for fire victims in his northern California district and \"worked to protect families from overregulation, ensure American farmers and ranchers can continue to feed the world\", according to his congressional website.Greene's resignation and LaMalfa's death left Republicans with a 218-213 majority, meaning they have only a two-vote cushion - if three don't vote or side with Democrats, Republicans lose.Within hours after LaMalfa's death was announced on Tuesday, news emerged that another Republican congressman had been hospitalized after a car wreck. Indiana Congressman Jim Baird was recuperating and \"expected to make a full recovery\", according to a statement posted to social media.There are currently four vacancies in the House with Democrats favoured to fill two of them - in special elections in Texas at the end of January, and in New Jersey in the spring.Under California law, Governor Gavin Newsom will have 14 days to call for a special election to fill LaMalfa's seat.

    "body": "10 hours agoChris GrahamGetty ImagesAmes was jailed in April 1994 after he admitted selling secret information to the Soviet Union and later RussiaAldrich Ames, a CIA officer who became one of America's most damaging double agents, has died aged 84. The former counterintelligence officer, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died on Monday at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, CBS News, the BBC's media partner in the US, reported.Ames was jailed on 28 April 1994 after he admitted to selling secret information to the Soviet Union and later Russia.He compromised more than 100 clandestine operations and divulged the identities of more than 30 agents spying for the West - leading to the deaths of at least 10 CIA intelligence assets. Seeking money to pay debts, Ames said he began providing the KGB with the names of CIA spies in April 1985, receiving an initial payment of $50,000.Known to the KGB by his code name, Kolokol (The Bell), Ames went on to identify virtually all of the CIA's spies in the Soviet Union, for which he was well rewarded. \"To my enduring surprise, the KGB replied that it had set aside for me $2 million in gratitude for the information,\" he said in an eight-page statement he read to the court.Over the course of nine years, Ames admitted receiving a total of about $2.5 million from the Soviet Union for his betrayal of the US.The cash fuelled a lavish lifestyle, with Ames splashing out on a new Jaguar car, foreign holidays and a $540,000 house - despite never having a salary of more than $70,000 a year.Ames's 31-year career at the CIA began when his father, an analyst at the CIA, helped him land a job there after dropping out of college in 1962.He married his first wife, fellow CIA agent Nancy Segebarth, in 1969, before being sent to Turkey as a counterintelligence officer to recruit foreign agents. Three years later, he was brought back to the US, where his problems with alcohol began to emerge and his marriage began to collapse.  Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase full of classified information on a subway, Ames was then sent to Mexico City in 1981. Sygma via Getty ImagesAmes' second wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Dupuy, was charged as his accompliceThere he met his second wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Dupuy, a cultural attaché at the Colombian embassy and a CIA asset who would later be charged as his accomplice.Returning to the US in 1983, Ames became head of the CIA's Soviet counterintelligence department - despite continuing concerns over his drinking. While his career was soaring, his personal life was spiralling. As well as paying monthly support to his first wife, he was also funding Rosario's lifestyle, including her love of shopping.It was his escalating debts that led him to selling the wealth of secrets that he had access to.  \"It was about the money, and I don't think he ever really tried to lead anybody to believe it was anything more than that,\" FBI agent Leslie G Wiser, who was involved in the investigation that led to Ames's arrest, told the BBC's Witness History in 2015.His treachery began in 1985 when he gave the Soviets the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000.His espionage continued for the following nine years, until his arrest on 21 February 1994, after a mole hunt that had started closing in the year before. Ames cooperated with the authorities in exchange for a plea deal that secured a lenient sentence for Rosario, who admitted she had known about the money and his meetings with the Soviets. She was released after five years.The CIA director at the time, R. James Woolsey, described Ames as \"a malignant betrayer of his country\". Woolsey said the agents Ames betrayed died because a \"murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoGabriela PomeroyGetty ImagesHundreds of people were stranded at Amsterdam airport Intense snowfall and icy weather conditions have caused widespread travel disruption across Europe, with six reported killed in weather-related incidents on the continent. Five people died in two separate regions of France as a result of treacherous driving conditions, authorities said, while one woman was also killed in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, after 16in (40cm) of snow fell on the city.Hundreds of flights have been cancelled across Europe, with thousands left stranded at airports in Paris and Amsterdam.Disruption is expected to continue into Wednesday.In France, three people died in two separate incidents in Landes, in the south-west, due to black ice, authorities said.Two more died in separate motor accidents in the Paris region. One was the result of a collision between a driver and a heavy goods vehicle in east Paris, police said. The other was killed after a taxi driver hit a kerb due to snow and plunged into the Marne river, the outlet said.The Balkans has also seen snow and heavy rain. A woman died in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Monday after a tree weighed down with wet snow fell on her, police said.French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said more snow was expected in the country on Tuesday night and Wednesday. He called on people to travel as little as possible on the roads and to work from home. France's national weather service said 38 districts would be placed on orange alert for snow and black ice on Wednesday. Many train services were cancelled in parts of the country. In France's capital, authorities said Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport would see 40% of its flights cancelled for several hours on Wednesday morning, so that staff could clear snow from the runways. The capital's Orly airport planned to cancel a quarter of its flights during the same time period.More than 400 flights were cancelled at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Wednesday, causing widespread disruption to travel plans. Hundreds of passengers were stranded, with many unable to join connecting flights. Long queues formed at airline counters as people waited for information about when flights would resume. ReutersThousands of passengers remain stranded after hundreds of flights were cancelledMany of the cancelled flights were operated by Dutch airline KLM, which warned it had nearly run out of de-icing fluid for its aircraft. It blamed the \"extreme\" weather conditions and supply delays.At Schiphol airport, many travellers complained of long lines and a lack of information. Spanish passenger Javier Sepulveda, who was trying to fly from Amsterdam to Norway, told Reuters news agency the situation at the airport was \"chaotic, unacceptable, frustrating, annoying\" and \"totally unacceptable.\" He said he started queuing at the KLM help desk at 06:30 local time (07:30 GMT) on Tuesday and that six hours later he was still far from the front of the line.Schipol airport said its \"snow crews are working around the clock to keep the runways clear, and aircraft are being carefully de-iced to ensure everyone can travel safely.\"A further 600 flights scheduled to take off from Schiphol on Wednesday have also been cancelled, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported.Rail journeys were also disrupted. On Tuesday morning, all train services in the Netherlands stopped for a short period after an IT outage. Some trains started running after 09:00 local time (10:00 GMT) but problems persisted during the day. Eurostar services to Paris from Amsterdam were either cancelled or running late.",

    "body": "At least 13 people have been killed - eight of them children - after a drone strike on a house in the Sudanese city of el-Obeid, says the Sudan Doctors' Network.Most of the dead were part of the same family, the medical group added.Although no group has claimed responsibility, the medics say the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out the attack in an area controlled by the army, and which it has been trying to penetrate for months.As the civil war between Sudan's army and RSF rebels approaches its third year, the scale of suffering has seen it described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis by the UN and aid agencies.To date, more than 11 million people have been forced from their homes by the violence, and hundreds of thousands of people have been killed. Widespread sexual violence is also being used as a weapon of war.Both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces are accused of atrocities.Witnesses say Monday's drone attack on the house in el-Obeid happened in a residential neighbourhood. The Sudan Doctors' Network says it \"reflects a dangerous escalation of the policy of indiscriminate killing and systematic bombing of safe residential areas\".The city of el-Obeid remains under army control despite the RSF's advance elsewhere in the wider state of North Kordofan.Analysts say it is a key target for the RSF because of its strategic location between Sudan's capital city,  Khartoum, and the Darfur region where they have established a parallel government and are accused of genocide.The attack comes days after the RSF hit a power plant in el-Obeid, and also follows what the army claims was an attempted RSF drone attack on the country's largest hydro-electric dam near the northern town of Merowe.",

    "body": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has reshuffled the leadership of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), replacing influential Vasyl Malyuk and nominating Maj-Gen Yevhenii Khmara as acting head.The SBU is primarily concerned with internal security and counter-intelligence and, since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, it has also played a prominent role in assassinations and sabotage attacks deep inside Russia.Malyuk, who had run the SBU since 2022, gained a reputation for overseeing successful operations against Russia and for purging the SBU from alleged Russian double agents.The reshuffles are the latest in a long series made by Zelensky since the start of the war.Malyuk's name is known across Ukraine. After all, last June he co-ordinated the daring \"Spider Web\" attack, which saw more than 100 Ukrainian drones strike air bases deep inside Russian territory. Khmara, his replacement, was also involved in the preparation of that operation.So it did not come as a surprise that Malyuk's dismissal earlier this week was widely criticised within Ukraine, including by several high-profile military commanders. The impression that the decision made by President Zelensky was short-sighted was cemented by reports that Malyuk had initially refused to step down voluntarily.Although he has been dismissed from the position of SBU chief, he has been asked  to continue leading special operations against Russia. Ukraine needed more \"asymmetric operations against Russian forces\", Zelensky said, adding that Malyuk was \"best at this\".Khmara's appointment has gone some way in quelling fears about the SBU's future effectiveness. But former SBU operative Ivan Stupak argues his reputation - though solid - is limited to a certain sphere and that it is unclear whether he will be able to translate his experience to running the wider SBU.Stupak also believes that Malyuk's dismissal is connected with the appointment of former spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as Zelensky's new chief of staff.\"Malyuk and Budanov are at loggerheads,\" he told the BBC, implying that Budanov had heavily influenced Zelensky's decision and that Khmara would now be \"in the hands\" of Budanov.Other analysts disagree. Oleksandr Notevskyi, political analyst for Ukrainian media outlet Grunt, praised Khmara's appointment, pointing out his successes in heading Alpha, one of the top elite divisions of the SBU: \"He's young, he's experienced, he is one of the authors of the Spider Web operation.\"In a statement, the SBU described Khmara as a decorated and \"experienced special-purpose officer\" who was involved in liberating the Kyiv region in 2022 and fighting the Russians in the occupied region of Donetsk.Khmara's appointment will need to be confirmed by the Ukrainian parliament, which may yet reject it. Other options are on the table, Notevskyi said. After nearly four years of war, Ukraine is struggling to push back Russian forces in the conventional way - on the battlefield and along the long front line in the east of the country. It has had more success targeting oil fields, weapons factories and - as in the case of the Spider Web attack - air bases and valuable aircraft.At this particular juncture of the war with Moscow, Notevskyi argued, \"whoever leads the security service should be someone who is specialised in eliminating Russia's military capacities on the territory of Russia\". Last week, Zelensky announced significant changes to his top team. Mykhailo Fedorov was nominated as new defence minister, while foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko replaced Budanov. Many of Zelensky's reshuffles have been criticised by commentators as damaging to the country at a time of crisis. Using a football analogy, Stupak argued that Zelensky was like a manager going to the substitute bench for replacements. \"But his bench is quite short, and he's running out of people to use again and again,\" he said.Additional reporting by Volodymyr Lozhko and Anastasiia Levchenko",

    "body": "1 day agoPaulin KolaEPARussia has intensified attacks - particularly against Ukraine's energy sectorFrench President Emmanuel Macron is hosting Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky and other key allies of the country as efforts intensify to agree security guarantees for Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.Heads of state and top officials from more than 30 countries - part of the so-called Coalition of the Willing - are meeting in Paris, including US mediators in peace talks Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Zelensky met Trump recently and said his plan to end the war with Russia was 90% agreed.However, the proposals have yet to be presented to Russia, whose response so far has been far from encouraging.The outstanding 10% of the agreement that's yet to be decided concerns territorial concessions Kyiv is being asked to agree to.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress on the ground recently and, therefore, is unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas.Russia has also consistently opposed any idea of a temporary ceasefire and has intensified its attacks in Ukraine, particularly aimed at paralysing its power supplies in the middle of a harsh winter.Ukraine has also hit back with drones - the latest target being an oil depot in the Lipetsk region of western Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte are among the participants at the Paris meeting. Leaders are expected to seek agreement on details that include a multi-national force to reassure Ukraine after a peace deal, what security guarantees to offer Ukraine in the event of a renewed Russian attack - as well as helping Ukraine's armed forces and its economy.For months, the so-called \"backstop\" has been on the agenda - the desire among Ukraine's European allies to secure a pledge from the US that it will be involved in responding to Russia should it violate the terms of a peace deal.Following talks between Zelensky and Trump in Florida last month, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.The talks in Paris are being overshadowed by the aftermath of the US's military action in Venezuela, where elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York.Following the raid, Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time.He also said the US was returning to last century's policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. Looming larger over the Paris talks is Trump's subsequent insistence that the US wants to annex Greenland - the semi-autonomous territory that is part of Denmark, a Nato ally.The repeated threat prompted Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to say any such move from the US would be the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance. European leaders have been reluctant to criticise Trump's intervention in Venezuela and its perceived implications for the world order.But many, including Starmer and Macron, have sided with Denmark over Greenland.As host of the talks, Macron will be keen not to have the issue derail the focus on Ukraine.",

    "body": "20 hours agoAbdirahman Ali Dhimbil,BBC SomaliandWedaeli ChibelushiIsrael's foreign minister has held talks with Somaliland's president on his first visit to the breakaway region since Israel controversially recognised it as an independent country.Gideon Saar said Israel was determined to advance relations with Somaliland \"with momentum\", while President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi hailed his visit as a \"big day\".Last month Israel became the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland, which declared independence from Somalia more than 30 years ago.Somalia sees Somaliland as being part of its territory, and condemned Saar's visit as \"unacceptable interference\" in its affairs. Saar posted on X that his talks with Abdullahi focused on the \"entirety of our relations\".He also addressed the backlash to Israel recognising Somaliland as an independent state, saying the decision was not made \"against anyone\".\"Only Israel will determine for itself who it recognises,\" he added.In a statement released by his office, Abdullahi said Israel had taken a \"courageous decision\" and Somaliland would cooperate with it in the \"strategic interest\".Saar said Abdullahi has accepted an invitation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjmain Netanyahu to visit Israel, but the Somaliland leader's office did not confirm this.Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991, after the overthrow of Somali military dictator Siad Barre. Israel's recognition of Somaliland last month came as a surprise, with Netanyahu citing Somaliland's \"right to self-determination\".This move sparked international condemnation and prompted an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. China, Turkey and the African Union were among those criticising Israel's step, while the European Union said Somalia's sovereignty should be respected.The US defended Israel, accusing its critics of double standards.Somaliland hopes that Israel's decision will have a domino effect, and other states will recognise its independence.But on Saturday, India's foreign ministry dismissed as \"fake\" claims on social media that it intends to do so.Abdullahi has said Somaliland would join the Abraham Accords, a deal brokered by the Trump administration in 2020, which saw a number of Arab states officially establish ties with Israel.Israel has pledged to cooperate with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy.Analysts say there are strategic reasons for Israel's declaration.\"Israel requires allies in the Red Sea region for many strategic reasons, among them the possibility of a future campaign against the Houthis,\" Israeli think tank the Institute for National Security Studies said, referring to Yemen's Iran-backed rebels, in a paper last month.",

    "body": "1 day agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesNestle has issued a global recall of some baby formula products over concerns they contain a toxin which can cause food poisoning.The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies.The batches were sold across the world, Nestle said, and they potentially contain cereulide, which can trigger nausea and vomiting when consumed.The company said there had been no confirmed reports of illness associated with the products, but was recalling them \"out of an abundance of caution\".\"The safety and wellbeing of babies is our absolute priority,\" Nestle said. \"We sincerely apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused to parents, caregivers, and customers.\"The company confirmed to the BBC that the recall was global. Affected products were sold in several European countries, including France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy and Sweden.It stressed that all other Nestle products and batches of the same products that have not been recalled are safe to consume.Nestle promised refunds for customers and said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers.Nestle France said it was carrying out a \"preventive and voluntary recall\" of certain batches of its Guigoz and Nidal infant formulas.In Germany, the formula products are called Beba and Alfamino.Batch numbers of the affected products in the UK can be found on Nestle's UK website, or through food.gov.uk.Customers are advised to look for the corresponding code on the base of the tin or box for powdered formulas or the base of the outer box and on the side or top of the container for ready-to-feed formulas.NestleNestle has recalled some batches of its SMA infant and follow-on formulaCereulide is a toxin produced by some strains of the Bacillus cereus bacteria that can cause food poisoning symptoms, which can be quick to develop and include vomiting and stomach cramps.It is unlikely to be deactivated or destroyed by cooking, using boiling water or when making the infant milk, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned.The FSA's head of incidents, Jane Rawling, said parents, guardians and caregivers should not feed infants or young children the affected products.She added: \"I want to reassure parents, guardians and caregivers that we are taking urgent action, helping to ensure all of the affected product is removed from sale as a precaution.\"If you have fed this product to a baby and have any concerns about potential health impact, you should seek advice from healthcare professionals by contacting your GP or calling NHS 111.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "A plot to kill Burkina Faso's military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, has been thwarted, the West African nation has announced.The sophisticated plan had been hatched by Lt Col Paul Henri Damiba, the military officer ousted by Traoré in September 2022, the security minister said in a late-night broadcast.\"Our intelligence services intercepted this operation in the final hours. They had planned to assassinate the head of state and then strike other key institutions, including civilian personalities,\" said Mahamadou Sana, further alleging that the plot had been funded from neighbouring Ivory Coast.There has been no comment from either Col Damiba or Ivory Coast.Since seizing power, Capt Traoré has faced at least two coup attempts and is also grappling with growing jihadist violence that has forced millions from their homes.Despite these challenges and his authoritarian reputation, the 37-year-old military leader maintains strong popular support and has gained a following across the continent for his pan-Africanist vision and criticism of Western influence.According to the security minister, the authorities uncovered a leaked video showing the plotters discussing their plans.In the footage they allegedly spoke about how they intended to assassinate the president - either at close range or by planting explosives at his residence - just after 23:00 local time on Saturday 3 January.Afterwards they allegedly planned to target other senior military and civilian figures.Sana alleged that Damiba had mobilised both soldiers and civilian supporters, secured foreign funding - most significantly 70m CFA francs ($125,000; £92,000)  delivered from Ivory Coast - and planned to knock out the country's drone-launch base before foreign forces could intervene.\"We are carrying out ongoing investigations and have made several arrests. These individuals will be brought to justice soon,\" the minister said on national television.Sana insisted the situation was under control and urged citizens \"not to be misled, out of naivety, into dangerous schemes\".It is not clear how many people have been arrested.Critics, both local and foreign, have accused Traoré of authoritarianism and say his government suppresses dissent - including arbitrary arrests of military officers and restrictions on the media.It is not the first time the junta has pointed the finger of blame about foreign interference in its affairs at Ivory Coast.These continuing internal power struggles will further heighten regional tensions.Col Damiba served as Burkina Faso's leader from January-September 2022 after seizing power from an elected government.After being ousted he went into exile in neighbouring Togo and said in a message published on social media that he wished his successor every success.",

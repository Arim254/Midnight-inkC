    "body": "Flights returning to normal after Airbus warning grounded planes2 days agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThousands of Airbus planes are returning to normal service after being briefly grounded following a warning that solar radiation could interfere with onboard computers.The aerospace giant - based in France - said about 6,000 of its A320 planes had been affected, with most requiring a quick software update. Some 900 older planes need a replacement computer.On Saturday, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the updates \"went very smoothly\" for more than 5,000 planes, and fewer than 100 still needed the update.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for what he called \"logistical challenges and delays\".He said teams were working to ensure that updates are completed \"as swiftly as possible\".On Saturday morning, several Air France flights in and out of Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport were delayed or cancelled.American Airlines said it expected \"operational delays\" but added that the vast majority of updates would be carried out by Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be limited.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said that airlines operating in the country worked through the night to carry out the update and air traffic had not been seriously affected.London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations.Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems, and Luton Airport reported that there was \"no expected impact\".British Airways and Air India are understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue.On Saturday, Easyjet said it had completed the update on a \"significant number\" of its aircraft, and planned to operate as normal.Wizz Air is also running as normal, having rolled out updates overnight.In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights. Most of its aircraft have now undergone the update, but some disruptions are expected though the weekend.Air New Zealand grounded its A320 planes, but all fights have now resumed after the update was completed.Airbus discovered the issue after a JetBlue Airways plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude and emergency landed in October. At least 15 people were injured.The firm identified a problem with the aircraft's computing software which calculates a plane's elevation, and found that at high altitudes, data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. As well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the A318, A319 and the A321 models were also affected.Older planes that require new computers remain grounded. How long the replacement takes will depend on the availability of computers.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was just days into a seven-year prison sentence for fraud.  Bureau of Prisons records show that Gentile was released on Wednesday, less than two weeks after he reported to prison. Gentile, the former chief executive and founder of GPB Capital, was convicted last year in what federal prosecutors described as a multi-year scheme to defraud more than 10,000 investors by misrepresenting the performance of private equity funds.He's the latest in a string of white-collar criminals whose sentences Trump has commuted.Gentile was convicted in August last year of securities and wire fraud charges, and sentenced in May. His co-defendant, Jeffry Schneider, was sentenced to six years in prison on the same charges. US attorney Joseph Nocella said at the time of Gentile's sentencing that GPB Capital was built on a \"foundation of lies\" and that the company made $1.6bn (£1.2bn) while using investor capital to pay distributions to other investors. \"The sentences imposed today are well deserved and should serve as a warning to would-be fraudsters that seeking [sic] to get rich by taking advantage of investors gets you only a one-way ticket to jail,\" he said. But the White House says the Department of Justice under former President Joe Biden made multiple missteps - and that investors were aware that their money could be going towards other people's dividends.\"Even though this was disclosed to investors the Biden Department of Justice claimed this was a Ponzi scheme,\" the White House official said.\"This claim was profoundly undercut by the fact that GPB had explicitly told investors what would happen.\"The official also cited concerns from Gentile that prosecutors had elicited false testimony.Trump's commutation of Gentile's sentence does not clear him of his crimes like a full presidential pardon would, and it does not get rid of other potential penalties imposed. So far in his second term, the president has pardoned or commuted the sentences of multiple people convicted of different types of fraud, including wire, securities, tax and healthcare fraud. Last month, he pardoned Tennessee state House Speaker Glen Casada who was convicted of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges.",

We had just the right amount to get through the holidays without any worries.\"",

Police searched them and found \"magnetised probes\" and a mirror attachment for a phone allegedly used to rig games.The pair have been charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage and remain in custody.New South Wales Police said the couple had arrived in Sydney from Kazakhstan in October and applied for membership to the casino the same day.Over the following weeks, they made a number of visits to the casino - reportedly the Crown on Sydney's waterfront - and accumulated winnings totalling A$1,179,412.50.This raised the suspicions of casino staff, who allegedly caught them in the act on Thursday.Police said the spying devices were connected to the couple's mobile phones, allowing them to capture and view images of the table.NSW PoliceCasino staff noticed Dilnoza Israilova wearing the small, discreet camera on her Mickey Mouse T-shirtThey also wore hidden earpieces, through which they allegedly received instructions on when to wager on card games.

    "description": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor ",
    "body": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor for New Jersey - a ruling likely to affect scores of criminal cases in the state.The president handpicked Habba for the role of US attorney this year, but a district court rejected her nomination, so the Trump administration installed her in a role that allowed her to fill in on an acting basis.The appellate judges found on Monday that this tactic, which bypassed confirmation by the US Senate, violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba is the second Trump-appointed prosecutor to be disqualified in recent weeks.\"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" one of the appellate judges, Judge Michael Fisher, wrote in Monday's ruling disqualifying Habba. The BBC has contacted Habba's office, the White House, and the Department of Justice for comment. In a joint statement, three lawyers who had challenged Habba's authority - Abbe David Lowell, Gerry Krovatin, and Norm Eisen - wrote that this marks \"the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions\".The statement continued: \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported US Attorneys wherever appropriate.\"Habba, 41, first joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. She went on to represent Trump in his hush-money trial in New York last year, when he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction. Before Habba took on the role of US Attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as \"unwavering in her loyalty\" and a \"tireless advocate for justice\".Monday's ruling may force the justice department to find a new prosecutor to supervise federal criminal cases in New Jersey. The appellate court's decision came after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey argued that the prosecutor's appointment was unlawful, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.A federal judge ruled in their favour in August. That order had been on hold while the appeals court heard the case. Habba is not the first Trump-appointed US prosecutor to face a legal challenge. A federal judge last week dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that the US attorney in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed as interim US attorney in Virginia. In October, a US district judge disqualified Bill Essayli from his role as acting US attorney for the Southern District of California, finding that he had stayed in the temporary post longer than the law allowed. But the judge allowed Essayli to continue overseeing the office - the most populous US federal judicial district, serving around 19 million people - in his role as first assistant US attorney. Defence attorneys have filed a motion to get that part of the judge's ruling reversed in an attempt to fully oust Essayli. In September, another US district judge disqualified Nevada's lead federal prosecutor Sigal Chattah, finding that she, too, was not lawfully serving as acting US attorney. ",

    "body": "Four people have been arrested in South Korea for allegedly hacking more than 120,000 video cameras in homes and businesses and using the footage to make sexually exploitative materials for an overseas website.Police announced the arrests on Sunday, saying the accused exploited the Internet Protocol (IP) cameras' vulnerabilities, such as simple passwords.A cheaper alternative to CCTV, IP cameras - otherwise known as home cameras - connect to a home internet network and are often installed for security or to monitor the safety of children and pets.Locations of cameras hacked in the country reportedly included private homes, karaoke rooms, a pilates studio and a gynaecologist's clinic.A statement released by South Korea's National Police Agency revealed that the four suspects operated independently of one another, and did not conspire together.One of the suspects is accused of hacking 63,000 cameras and producing 545 sexually exploitative videos, which he then sold for 35 million won ($12,235; £9,250) worth of virtual assets. Another allegedly hacked 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for 18 million won worth of assets.The two suspects were responsible for approximately 62% of videos posted in the past year on a website that illegally distributed IP camera hacking footage.Police are now moving to block and shut down that website, and cooperating with foreign agencies to investigate its operator. They have also arrested three people who are suspected of having bought and viewed material through the site.\"IP camera hacking and illegal filming inflict immense suffering on victims and are therefore serious offences. We will eradicate them through vigorous investigations,\" said Park Woo-hyun, a cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency.\"Viewing and possessing illegally filmed videos are also serious crimes, so we will actively investigate them.\"Authorities have personally visited or notified victims at 58 locations, informing them of the incident and providing guidance on changing passwords.They are also helping victims delete and block content, and working to identify others who may have been affected.\"Above all, it is crucial and effective for individual users who have installed IP cameras in homes or business premises to remain vigilant and immediately and regularly change their access passwords,\" the National Police Agency said in its statement.",

It is feared that children are among the missing.The landslide was caused by \"erosion\" of the bank of the Ucayali River - the headwater of the Amazon - the country's National Emergency Operations Center said on X.Some 50 people were on board one of the boats, according to news agency AFP.Rescue operations have been hindered by the fast-flowing river waters, a navy official told AFP.Children, teachers and doctors were among the passengers, the Reuters news agency reports, citing Andina.Authorities are working with families gathered at the scene of the disaster to try to determine exactly how many people still need to be found.One of the boats had departed Pucallpa to the north on Sunday and was travelling towards the riverside communities of Caco Macaya, Curiaca del Caco, and Pueblo Nuevo del Caco, local media reports.",

    "body": "The abrupt cancellations of several Japanese music events in Shanghai - one of them midway through a song - have sparked criticism among fans, with some calling the moves \"rude\" and \"extreme\".Maki Otsuki was halfway through the theme of hit anime One Piece on Friday when the lights and music went off, after which she was rushed off stage by two crew members.On Saturday, pop star Ayumi Hamasaki performed to an empty 14,000-seat stadium after organisers axed her concert in Shanghai, citing \"force majeure\".This spate of cancellations come as diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Tokyo fester over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on Taiwan.While responding to a question in parliament last month, Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan.Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it.Both sides have since lodged protests against each other, and the rift has also affected daily living in both countries.Otsuki's management attributed the interruption of her performance on Friday to \"unavoidable circumstances\". \"Other than the performance being cancelled, there were no particular problems, and the local staff were very kind and helpful,\" it wrote in a separate statement on Monday, in which it declined interviews on the matter.Her performance was part of a three-day music festival in Shanghai, for which subsequent events were also called off after \"comprehensively taking into consideration various factors\", according to Japan's Kyodo News.The BBC has reached out to Japanese entertainment company Bandai Namco, who is one of the organisers of the festival.Asked about the incident at a daily media conference on Monday, a spokesperson from Beijing's foreign ministry told reporters: \"I suggest you chat with the Chinese organisers.\"Some of Otsuki's fans have made a meme comparing the shutting down of her performance with the shocking removal of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given \"the Hu Jintao treatment\".On social media, some accused the Chinese authorities of taking away its own people's freedom to enjoy culture, in its attempts to sanction Japan. \"What's the point of turning the spearhead toward its own citizens?\" read an X post written in Japanese.\"Don't you care about the audience - they are after all Chinese, right?\" wrote a user on China's X-like platform Weibo. George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, joined the conversation online. \"It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music,\" he wrote in an X post which also included a link to Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. \"Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!\" he wrote.However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. \"How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?\" a Weibo user wrote.Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the \"people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour\" she wrote on Instagram.\"I still strongly believe that entertainment should be a bridge that connects people, and I want to be on the side of creating that bridge,\" she wrote.Two weeks ago, Chinese state media announced that the releases of at least two popular Japanese anime films will be postponed amid the diplomatic row.

    "body": "Pope Leo XIV has visited Istanbul's Sultan Ahmed Mosque - widely known as the Blue Mosque - in his first visit to a Muslim place of worship since he took up the papacy in May.The Pontiff was seen bowing as he entered the building, but it is reported he did not pray at the mosque, as his two predecessors had done.The Vatican said in a statement Leo undertook the tour \"in a spirit of reflection and listening, with deep respect for the place and for the faith of those who gather there in prayer\".The Pope is on a four-day trip to Turkey, after which he will visit Lebanon.He was later welcomed to St George's Cathedral in Istanbul by the head of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Patriarch Bartholomew.The Blue Mosque is officially named for Sultan Ahmed I, leader of the Ottoman Empire from 1603 to 1617, who oversaw its construction. It is decorated with thousands of blue and turquoise ceramic tiles and receives millions of visitors each year.Pope Francis prayed there in 2014, and Pope Benedict XVI did so in 2006.The first pope to officially enter a mosque was John Paul II, who made history when he visited the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in 2001. The papal visit to Turkey and Lebanon had been planned by late Pope Francis, but its theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.At the start of his trip, he warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", adding that \"the future of humanity is at stake\".In Lebanon - where an estimated third of the country is Christian - he is expected to meet more faith leaders and hear from young people. On the final day of the trip, he will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.",

The Labor leader's proposal and the wedding reception both took place at his official residence, The Lodge.ReutersAlbanese (right) alongside his son Nathan and his dog Toto - the ring bearerUntil the big day, the wedding plans had been kept under wraps due to concerns about security and potential disruptions.In attendance were Jodie Haydon's parents as well as Albanese's son, Nathan, from his previous marriage.Albanese's dog Toto acted as ring bearer while the couple walked back down the aisle to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\".The prime minister also shared a video on his official social media accounts showing the happy couple walking down the aisle as guests showered them in confetti. Several of Albanese's cabinet ministers attended the ceremony. ReutersAt the reception, their first dance was to The Way You Look Tonight by Frank Sinatra.The celebrations also featured custom-made beer cans printed with the image used to announce their engagement.The couple are set to honeymoon in Australia from Monday to Friday next week - plans that were pared back after his re-election in May.Albanese, 62, and Jodie Haydon, 47, first met at a business dinner in Melbourne in 2020, while he was leader of the opposition.ReutersShe appeared during Albanese's 2022 and 2025 election campaigns, and was seen alongside the PM at major events, including the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and a state dinner hosted by former US President Joe Biden.Albanese also made Australian history by becoming the first prime minister to get engaged while in office.The couple said in a joint statement at the time that they were \"so lucky to have found each other\".",

    "body": "A Russian missile attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has killed four people and injured 40, authorities have said. Unconfirmed reports say a ballistic missile was used in the strike, which took place on Monday morning. Videos shared online showed a large explosion occur on the side of a motorway, and local media said an office block, cars and shops were hit or badly damaged. Dnipro, which lies around 100km (62 miles) from the front line, has frequently come under Russian attack since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.The attack came a day before US special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to meet President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Witkoff has visited the Russian president several times this year, but has never been to Kyiv. On Sunday, a Ukrainian delegation met Witkoff, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Florida. Zelensky said on Monday that the talks had been \"very constructive\" but that there were some \"tough issues\" to be worked through - echoing Rubio's comments that the meeting had been \"productive\" but that there was \"more work to be done\".The Florida meeting was the latest step in weeks of intense \"shuttle diplomacy\" which saw Ukrainian and Russian delegations separately engage with US officials to discuss a peace plan. Despite efforts, however, substantial differences remain between Moscow and Kyiv's positions. Russia has refused to back down from its core demand that Ukraine retreats from the areas of the Donbas region it still holds, which Kyiv maintains it will never do. \"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Vladimir Putin said. In response, Zelensky said that Russia \"scorned\" efforts \"to truly end the war\".Matters surrounding Ukraine's future security are also a source of contention. Kyiv and its European partners are keen for Ukraine to be given security guarantees - such as Nato membership - that would protect it from being attacked again. But Russia vehemently opposes this and Donald Trump too has ruled out allowing Ukraine to join the military alliance.Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived in Paris to rally support from French President Emmanuel Macron, and will head to Ireland on Tuesday. In recent weeks, concern has grown in Kyiv and among Europeans that the US was becoming more amenable to Russia's demands than Ukraine's, and that Europe was being excluded from the negotiating table. Zelensky has also been weakened politically at home by a corruption scandal. His chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who had also led the Ukrainian delegation at peace talks, resigned on Friday after anti-corruption investigators raided his home - although he has not been accused of wrongdoing. Two cabinet ministers have also been fired.On Sunday Trump told reporters on Air Force One that Ukraine had \"some difficult little problems\", referring to the scandal, and repeated his view that both Russia and Ukraine wanted to end the war.Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or injured, as well as thousands of civilians, and at least seven million people have become refugees, since Russia invaded on 24 February 2022.The conflict between the two ex-Soviet states stretches back to 2014 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting armed uprisings in eastern Ukraine.",

The content being shared was not created or approved by us, and we have asked for it to be removed.\"While Keli Holiday is a friend of The Wiggles, the video and the music added to it were created independently and without our knowledge.\"The clip was filmed at the TikTok Awards earlier this month where members of the band appeared on stage with Holiday - whose real name is Adam Hyde - during his song Dancing2. Holiday shared the video on TikTok, with the caption \"The Wiggles get it\",  to promote his new single Ecstasy. The song's chorus lyrics are: \"Hey girl, come on dance with me. You and your pocket full of ecstasy.\"A spokesperson for The Wiggles told The West Australian newspaper that the band's performances at the awards had been \"family-friendly\" and that the video had been \"edited together separately and without our awareness\".Created in 1991 as part of a university assignment, The Wiggles has become an international phenomenon among young children. Anthony Fields is the only original member still with the group.Keli Holiday is the solo project of Hyde, who is also known for being one half of electronic dance duo Peking Duk.The BBC has contacted Holiday's management for comment.",

    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "body": "10 hours agoChris EwokorBBC Africa, AbujaGunmen have abducted at least 20 people, including a pastor and a new bride, in two separate attacks in the latest Nigerian kidnappings.Attackers stormed the newly established Cherubim and Seraphim Church on Sunday in the central Kogi state, firing shots and forcing congregants to flee in panic. They seized the pastor, his wife and several worshippers.In another raid the night before in the northern Sokoto state, a bride and her bridesmaids were among those kidnapped. A baby, the baby's mother and another woman were also taken, the AFP news agency reports.Schools and places of worship have increasingly been targeted in the latest wave of attacks in north and central Nigeria.It is not clear who is behind the kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments, however a presidential spokesman has told the BBC they believe they are the work of jihadist groups. Kogi state government spokesman Kingsley Fanwo confirmed the attack in Ejiba to the BBC but was unable to confirm the numbers.He said authorities were working to track down the attackers.\"The security network, comprising the conventional security agencies and the local security architecture are currently doing what they should do,\" he told the BBC.In the attack in the mostly Muslim Sokoto state, local media reported that the bride had been preparing for a wedding ceremony the following morning and she was seized alongside her friends and other guests who had gone to support her.Some 250 schoolchildren and 12 teachers are still believed to be missing following the biggest such attack in recent weeks, while those seized in other raids have reportedly been released.The spate of abductions has renewed concerns about the vulnerability of rural communities. It adds to pressure on the authorities to bolster protection for those at risk -  schools, churches and isolated communities.Paying ransoms has been outlawed in a bid to stop the lucrative kidnapping industry, however it is widely believed that such payments are still being made.Nigeria's security crisis attracted the international spotlight last month after US President Donald Trump threatened to send over troops if the government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".Nigerian officials and analysts say that members of all faiths are victims of the violence and kidnappings and say it is not true that Christians are being targeted.Additional reporting by Basillioh Rukanga",

    "body": "23 hours agoImogen Foulkes,GenevaandTom BennettThe founder of the Swiss right-to-die organisation Dignitas has died by assisted suicide, the group says.Ludwig Minelli, 92, died on Saturday, days before his 93rd birthday.The group paid tribute to Minelli, saying he had led a \"life for freedom of choice, self-determination, and human rights\".Minelli founded Dignitas in 1998, and since then it has helped thousands of people to die. In recent decades, some countries have shifted their stance on assisted dying, with Australia, Canada and New Zealand introducing laws. The UK House of Lords is currently debating the assisted dying bill. Critics of the legalisation say it could see disabled and vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives.Minelli began his career as a journalist, working as a correspondent for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, before studying law and taking an interest in human rights.Across his life, he campaigned passionately for the right to die, giving Dignitas the slogan \"dignity in life, dignity in death\". In a 2010 interview with the BBC, he said: \"I am persuaded that we have to struggle in order to implement the last human right in our societies. And the last human right is the right to make a decision on one's own end, and the possibility to have this end without risk and without pain.\"Minelli founded Dignitas after splitting from the older Swiss assisted dying organisation, Exit, because he felt its rules were too restrictive.

    "body": "First writing may be 40,000 years earlier than thought5 hours agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterUniversity of Tübingen / Hildegard JensenA 40,000-year-old mammoth figurine with engraved rows of crosses and dotsThe history of writing down thoughts and feelings could be tens of thousands of years older than previously believed, surprising archaeologists who made the discovery.The researchers discerned patterns of meaning in lines, notches, dots, and crosses on objects like mammoth tusks as old as 45,000 years in caves in Germany.Traditionally historians date the first written words to proto-cuneiform scripts made around 5,000 years ago in ancient Iraq, or Mesopotamia.The precise meaning of the symbols in Germany remains a mystery.The objects are from just before Homo sapiens moved to Europe from Africa where they interacted with Neanderthals.Until now it was thought that writing developed in Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE, followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt and later in China and Mesoamerica.\"The Stone Age sign sequences are an early alternative to writing,\" says Prof Christian Bentz from Saarland University, an author of the new research.The work suggests that Stone Age people were as clever as modern-day humans, according to researcher Ewa Dutkiewicz from Berlin's Museum of Prehistory and Early History.\"So far, we've only scratched the surface of what can be found in terms of symbol sequences on a wide variety of artifacts,\" she says.The team analysed more than 3,000 characters on 260 objects to uncover what they call the DNA of writing.Some of the objects are from a 37-km long cave system called the Lonetal in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany.Landesmuseum Württemberg / Hendrik ZwietaschThe so-called \"adorant\" has a human-like figure and several rows of notches and dots. On a small mammoth carved from tusk, the researchers analysed carefully engraved rows of crosses and dots.And on an artefact called \"adorant\" from the Geißenklösterle cave in the Achtal valley, they identified rows of dots and notches on an ivory plaque showing a lion-human creature.They believe the arrangement of the marks, in particular the dots on the back, show the patterns acted as communication.The researchers believe that Stone Age people deliberately carved these symbols to communicate messages, meaning, and convey thoughts.Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Vorderasiatisches Museum / Olaf M. TesmerA proto-cuneiform tablet from around 3350 years ago \"Our results also show that the hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic era developed a symbol system with a statistically comparable information density to the earliest proto-cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia – a full 40,000 years later,\" says Bentz.The clue to finding meaning is in the density of the symbols. They found high repetition of the signs and predictability in the subsequent symbols that is \"comparable to much later proto-cuneiform,\" according to Bentz.They found denser patterns on figurines than on tools.The team say that it shows that communicating information was very important for Paleolithic people.\"They were skilled craftspeople. You can tell they carried the objects with them. Many of them fit very well in the hand, just the right size to fit in the palm,\" says Dutkiewicz.The research is published in the journal PNAS.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBen HattonReutersThe president and CEO of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende, has resigned after a review into his links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The forum ordered an independent review into Brende over his ties to the disgraced financier following the release of Epstein files by the US Department of Justice.Brende has acknowledged he dined with Epstein three times between 2018 and 2019 and communicated with him by email and text, but said he was \"completely unaware\" of his past criminal activity.The WEF said a review into his links to Epstein found \"there were no additional concerns beyond what has been previously disclosed\".Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister, has also said he regretted not having investigated Epstein more thoroughly.The WEF holds an annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, which attracts political and business leaders from across the world.In a statement on Thursday, Brende said he had decided to step down after more than eight years in the role following \"careful consideration\". \"I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions,\" he said.Epstein was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, for which he was registered as a sex offender.Being named in the Epstein files does not indicate criminality and Brende has not been accused of wrongdoing.WEF co-chairs Andre Hoffmann and Larry Fink thanked Brende for his \"significant contributions\" and said they respected his decision.Alois Zwinggi will serve as interim president and CEO while the organisation's board of trustees oversees a process to identify a permanent successor, the WEF said. Zwinggi had been a managing director on the WEF's executive body. A number of politicians, celebrities, business leaders and royals from across the world have faced scrutiny over their links to Epstein following the release of the latest tranche of files linked to US investigations into Epstein. The files contain millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.Former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland was charged with \"gross corruption\" earlier this month over his ties with Epstein, police said.",

    "body": "15 hours agoKelly NgAFP via Getty ImagesTommy Schaefer and his then-girlfriend Heather Mack were jailed for the shocking murder of Mack's mother Indonesia has deported a US man who spent 11 years in jail for the high-profile \"suitcase murder\" of his girlfriend's mother on the resort island of Bali. In 2014, Tommy Schaefer was on holiday in Bali with his then-girlfriend Heather Mack and her mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack. The couple conspired to kill Wiese-Mack, reportedly to gain access to a $1.5m (£1.17m) trust fund.Her body was later discovered stuffed inside a suitcase. Schaefer was released from a Bali jail on Tuesday morning after receiving a number of remissions for good behaviour. But the 33-year-old will still face federal charges in the US and is due to appear before the court in Chicago on Thursday, according to reports.Shortly before boarding his flight back to the US on Tuesday night, Schaefer apologised for his actions. \"I'm sorry. I'm always sorry. I'm always sorry,\" Schaefer told AFP news agency.\"I was thrust into this situation, but I take full responsibility for everything I have done and I hope Sheila's family finds peace.\"In 2015, an Indonesia court sentenced Schaefer to 18 years in jail and Mack to 10 years, for what the presiding judge called a \"sadistic\" killing.Prosecutors had said that Mack - who was 18 at the time of the murder and pregnant - covered her mother's mouth while Schaefer struck her in the head with a fruit bowl. The body was stuffed inside a suitcase and left it in the boot of a taxi, prosecutors said. The driver later alerted police.The couple was later discovered staying at another hotel in Bali.Schaefer, then 21, said on trial that he had been defending himself after Wiese-Mack became angry after learning that her daughter was pregnant. Mack was given a shorter sentence due to her lesser role and because she gave birth to a baby while on trial, the Bali court heard. She too was released early and deported in 2021. She was arrested immediately upon arriving in the US and charged with conspiracy to kill a US national and obstruction of justice - and eventually sentenced to 26 years in jail. Mack originally pleaded not guilty to the US charges on conspiring to kill a US national, but changed her plea after the prosecutors offered to ask for a shorter sentence.Mack has given media interviews over the years from prison, where she recounted the incident and her troubled relationship with her mother.",

    "body": "13 hours agoKoh EweandDanny Vincent,Hong KongGetty ImagesJimmy Lai was sentenced to nearly six years in jail in 2022 for a fraud offenceJimmy Lai, Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon, has won an appeal against a fraud conviction in 2022, which had seen him sentenced to nearly six years in jail. On Thursday, Hong Kong's Court of Appeal quashed the convictions of Lai and another defendant who had been accused of illegally subletting office space.But the 78-year-old will remain in prison. Earlier this month, he was sentenced to 20 years in jail for colluding with foreign forces under the city's national security law.Lai, a British citizen, is a fierce critic of Beijing and is one of the biggest figures in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. He has been detained since 2020.Lai's daughter Claire described the ruling on Thursday as \"nothing more than a PR move by the Hong Kong authorities\". \"No one should be fooled into thinking.. [it] is anything more,\" she told the BBC.\"The rule of law is broken there, and my father is still unjustly imprisoned and will remain so for nearly 20 years unless urgent action is taken to secure his release.\"Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, who leads Lai's international legal team, echoed this, saying the decision \"changes nothing\" and that Lai risks dying in prison because of ill health.\"No one should be fooled into thinking that this fraud appeal belatedly succeeding suggests the Hong Kong system operates fairly or justly,\" she told the BBC.In 1995, Lai founded Apple Daily, a local tabloid that was critical of Beijing and became Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy paper. The paper was shuttered in 2021 after Lai and other key staff members were arrested.The paper was at the heart of Lai's fraud trial. Prosecutors argued that Lai breached lease terms by allowing his private consultancy firm to operate in office space that Apple Daily had rented.Wong Wai-keung, a former executive at Lai's media company, was also charged in the same case and jailed for 21 months.Critics say Lai's trials and detention are a sign of the shrinking civil liberties in Hong Kong, especially after the introduction of a Beijing-imposed national security law.This month, the UK and the US governments said the national security law has been used to \"silence\" activists like Lai.But Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have argued that the law is necessary to maintain stability and deny it has weakened the territory's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China. Rights groups and Lai's family have raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison. Last December Claire Lai told the BBC that her father's teeth were rotting and his fingernails \"sometimes fall off\".But Chinese authorities maintained that Lai was \"in good health\" and received \"appropriate\" care.Supporters claim that Jimmy Lai has long been facing political persecution through the courts. The overturning of the sentence on Thursday has been met with some scepticism by some.\"Even if [he] is released at 96 rather than 98, it doesn't make much difference,\" one supporter who attended court told the BBC.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "'People are getting poorer': How Iran's struggling economy is changing how families live5 hours agoBehrang Tajdin,Economics correspondent, BBC PersianandGhoncheh Habibiazad,Senior reporter, BBC PersianEPAFood prices have doubled in Iran in the past 12 months, official figures show\"We used to eat out twice a month,\" says Marjan, who lives in Iran's second largest city, Isfahan. \"Now we just can't. We have to save that money to pay the rent.\"For the last six years, she had been selling wooden crafts and keyrings through a page on Instagram - one of hundreds of thousands of Iranian women making a living that way.When the government imposed an internet blackout in early January as part of a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests, these women suddenly found themselves with no income.\"Even once the internet came back, things just weren't the same,\" says Marjan - whose name, as with the other contributors, has been changed for safety reasons. \"Our sales used to be 300 million rials (around $185 on the open market) per month. Now it's not even 30 million rials.\"She and her husband are seriously considering selling their car to pay back their loans and keep up with the rent. \"If things carry on like this, I'll probably have to look for a new job,\" she says. \"The problem is that pretty much every line of work is struggling at the moment, so even that is not a realistic plan B.\"The protests began as a reaction to the spiralling cost of living and soon focused on the whole regime, whose policies people blamed for their difficulties.  The economic situation has worsened in the weeks since the protests erupted.'Just incomprehensible'Affording the basic necessities of life is becoming an increasing struggle for many Iranians because of high inflation.\"Just two months ago, beef was 7m rials per kilo,\" says Mina, a 44-year-old mother of two in Tehran. \"But I bought some the day before yesterday for 19m rials a kilo - more than double. I bought Iranian rice in the late summer for 1.7m rials a kilo, now it's 3.8m.\"The official figures show that in the past 12 months, the price of basic necessities has increased by an average 60%, while food prices have doubled in the same period.And it is not just the last year. The cost of an average family food basket is currently eight times what it was five years ago and more than 30 times what it was in 2016.\"Inflation has basically become a monthly part of our lives now,\" says Amir, a 29-year-old English teacher in Karaj, 30km (20 miles) west of Tehran. \"Prices go up easily by 10% a month\".Back in the spring, he says, \"a hamburger cost 5m rials. It is now 12m. The numbers are just incomprehensible\".These soaring food prices is why you hear more and more Iranians talking about red meat vanishing from their tables in recent years, to be replaced by cheaper alternatives such as chicken, cheese or beans.Figures released by the Central Bank of Iran shows that annual consumption of beef and lamb per household has declined from 64kg in 2004/05 to 32kg in 2024/25.The inflation is forcing families to cut back.Mina says that her family has stopped buying branded goods and that they have not been on a foreign holiday since 2017.\"I can't afford to travel abroad at all. I checked a domestic trip yesterday, 200m rials per person. So for our family of four, that's 800m just for plane tickets. Back in 2017, a whole trip to Europe cost 200m.\"One of the main drivers of these soaring costs has been the rapid fall in the value of the rial.Since May 2018, when Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a nuclear deal with Iran and reinstated wide-ranging sanctions on the country, the Iranian currency has lost more than 95% of its value against the US dollar on the open market.The past year has been particularly turbulent.The rapid fall in the value of the rial sparked the protests in Tehran's bazaar in late December, which soon spread across the country. The protests were brutally suppressed by the security forces, who killed thousands of people.Since then, the rial's value has kept falling, pushing up the prices even higher.Those with fixed incomes can see how this has eroded their purchasing power.Worse every yearSima, a former senior civil servant who has recently retired, says her income is now six times what it was a decade ago, but in dollars, it is worth several times less.\"In 2015, my salary of 50m rials a month was roughly worth $1,500. By 2020, it had risen to 130m rials and was worth around $520. Now my pension is about 300m and worth less than $200,\" says the 60-year-old Tehran resident.\"Ten years ago, I used to change my mobile phone every two years, sometimes even once a year,\" she says. \"I could easily afford a brand-new imported car back then. Now, we can't even upgrade to a slightly better second-hand one, let alone buy new.\"The gradual fall in living standards has been the story of the past two decades.BBC Persian analysis of the official data shows that over the past 20 years, the average annual household expenditure in real terms has fallen by a quarter in urban areas and has almost halved in rural areas.In other words, Iranians are on average much poorer than they were 20 years ago.This is despite the fact that from 1990 to mid-2000s this measure was on an upward trajectory.However, the sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear programme created a toxic combination of persistently high levels of inflation, low employment, and low or no real GDP growth, has resulted in Iranian families seeing their living standards fall. And events of the last 12 months have severely worsened the situation.Shadow of warSince the 12-day war between Iran and Israel last June, during which the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities, the Iranian economy has remained in a state of suspense, and many think that it is not a question of \"if\" but \"when\" hostilities will flare up again.The resumption of talks on a new deal between Iran and the US in February, with Trump threatening military action if the Iranian government does not agree to his demands, has not helped the business sentiment much either.\"Investors are not thinking of expansion or creating jobs. They are only thinking of saving their business,\" says a spokesman for Iran's private sector.Farshid Shokrekhodaei, head of investment and financing at the Iran Chamber of Commerce told Ilna news agency that because of these conditions \"the capital is going towards investing in assets such as foreign currency and gold\", instead of investing in productive businesses.This is in addition to other crises that had been adversely affecting businesses and people.Iran is facing a serious shortage of electricity, natural gas and water, as a result of years of underinvestment in infrastructure and the government's failure to manage consumption.Every winter, factories have their gas supply cut off for days, even weeks, at a time.  In the warmer months, their electricity is cut off. People also have to endure regular blackouts at home, as well as their drinking water supply being shut off in larger cities.But all those problems are overshadowed by the \"not war, not peace\" situation - as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei put it - between Iran and the US.Many people, like Parham, a 26-year-old from Tehran, do not think that it can \"continue for much longer - not for us, nor for the US.\"\"Given that people are getting poorer and poorer, we're going to see a wave of social instability,\" he says.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaulin KolaEPATrump's plans to seize control of Greenland have dominated Danish politicsDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has announced early elections - hailing the next four years as \"decisive\" for her country.\"We as Danes and as Europeans will really have to stand on our own feet,\" Frederiksen told parliament. \"We need to define our relationship with the United States,\" she added. The past few months of Danish politics have been dominated by US President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Last month, Trump dropped threats to use force against the fellow Nato ally to seize the Arctic island he argues is necessary to defend against possible attacks from Russia and China.Announcing the decision to call early elections on 24 March, Prime Minister Frederiksen told parliament that security \"is and will remain the very foundation of Danish politics for many, many years to come\". \"We must rearm to ensure peace on our continent,\" she said. \"We must stick together in Europe, and we must secure the future of the Danish Commonwealth\" - Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.\"Whether I will continue to be your prime minister depends on how strong a mandate you give the Social Democrats,\" Frederiksen said mentioning her party, the lead partner in the current Danish coalition. Trump has claimed without evidence that it is \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\". More than 100 US military personnel are permanently stationed at a US base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But Trump has not abandoned his plans - he has said previously that the US needs to own Greenland to properly defend it - and talks continue over ways of establishing US control over the entire island. Both Denmark and Greenland have said they will not agree to cede sovereignty to the US. Their European allies have rallied to their support.The latest confrontation may come in the next few days if Trump follows through with an announcement that the US plans to send a boat filled with medical supplies to Greenland, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\". Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen rejected the proposal, telling Trump that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKostas KoukoumakasIn AthensGetty ImagesThe case was heard in a low-ranking court in Athens that hears misdemeanours (file pic)Four people have been found guilty and given jail terms by a Greek court after a wiretapping scandal shook the country in 2022.In what became known as \"Greece's Watergate\", surveillance software called Predator was used to target 87 people - among them government ministers, senior military officials and journalists.The four who had marketed the software were found guilty by an Athens court of misdemeanours of violating the confidentiality of telephone communications and illegally accessing personal data and conversations.The court sentenced the four defendants to lengthy jail sentences, suspended pending appeal. Although they each face 126 years, only eight would be typically served which is the upper limit for misdemeanours.One in three of the dozens of figures targeted had also been under legal surveillance by Greece's intelligence services (EYP).Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who had placed EYP directly under his supervision, called it a scandal, but no government officials have been charged in court and critics accuse the government of trying to cover up the truth.The case dates back to the summer of 2022, when the current head of Greek Socialist party Pasok, Nikos Androulakis - then an MEP - was informed by the European Parliament's IT experts that he had received a malicious text message containing a link.Predator spyware, marketed by the Athens-based Israeli company Intellexa, can get access to a device's messages, camera, and microphone. Its use was illegal in Greece at that time but a new law passed in 2022 has since legalised state security use of surveillance software under strict conditions.Androulakis also discovered that he had been tracked for \"national security reasons\" by Greece's intelligence services.The scandal has since escalated into a debate over democratic accountability in Greece.Despite the seriousness of the case, this is the only part of it that has come to trial and took place in a court concerned only by misdemeanors.The small ground floor courtroom was full of Greek and foreign journalists on Thursday morning.The four defendants found guilty -  two Greeks called Felix Bitzios and Yiannis Lavranos  and two Israelis Tal Dilian and Sara Hamou – were not in the dock for the verdict, as had been the case during the five months the trial lasted.The court refused to grant mitigation to the defendants.The judge said that the defendants appear to have acted with the participation of \"unknown third parties,\" explaining that among them there may be officials from Greek and foreign intelligence services, and decided to send the trial records to the Athens Prosecutor's Office so that it can be investigated whether a series of felonies were committed including the offense of espionage.Among the many public figures targeted in the scandal was Thanasis Koukakis, a financial reporter who investigates corruption.\"The decision satisfies me with regard to the violation of my private life,\" he told the BBC. \"The court proved that there are safeguards in place for the functioning of the rule of law in Greece.\"After today's decision, justice must, without distraction, investigate the involvement of third parties in felony offenses,\" said Zacharias Kesses, a lawyer for victims of the Predator affair.",

    "body": "Russia and Ukraine exchange more than 1,000 soldiers' bodies2 hours agoPaulin KolaMedinski Instagram postThe peace talks have not produced any results, but prisoners and bodies have been exchangedRussia says it has handed over the remains of 1,000 soldiers to Ukraine and has received the bodies of 35 Russian soldiers in return.It comes as Ukraine's chief negotiator met US President Donald Trump's envoys in Geneva to discuss economic plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.Negotiators were also preparing a third round of US-led talks aimed at ending the conflict which has entered its fifth year - a trilateral meeting involving the Russian side, too. Hours before the Geneva talks, Russia launched 420 drones and 39 missiles in six different regions of Ukraine, injuring dozens of people, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said.Vladimir Medinsky, a top aide of Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced the exchange of bodies in a short announcement on Telegram. He gave no details, but included an image showing bodies being unloaded from a truck. Hours later, Ukraine said it had received 1,000 bodies which, \"according to prior information from the Russian side, may belong to Ukrainian defenders\".The two sides have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the conflict that began with Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The exchange is based on an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in June 2025. Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of up to 6,000 soldiers each, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.Kyiv and Moscow regularly publish estimates of the other side's losses, but do not detail their own.And from public sources, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 186,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. The true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.So even though estimates suggest more Russians are dying every day, Moscow has returned more bodies to Ukraine overall than it has received. No-one has explained the discrepancy, even though Russia has previously accused Ukraine of not abiding by the Istanbul agreement, and Ukraine has alleged Russian body returns were irregular and sometimes included Russians' remains - a charge Moscow has rejected.One possible explanation is that Russia captures more Ukrainian bodies given its troops have been on the attack most of the time and, therefore, more able to retrieve them from the battlefield.On the eve of the Geneva talks, President Zelensky had a telephone conversation with Trump and said he expected the Geneva meeting would lead to trilateral negotiations at the beginning of March - thus creating \"an opportunity to move talks to the leaders' level\". \"President Trump supports this sequence of steps,\" Zelensky said, adding: \"This is the only way to resolve all the complex and sensitive issues and finally end the war.\" Putin, for his part, has refused to meet Zelensky, describing him as illegitimate - an argument centring on the fact that no presidential election has been held in Ukraine, despite the expiry of Zelensky's term in March 2024.However, Ukraine's constitution bars holding elections under martial law - imposed in the wake of Putin's invasion of his neighbour.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNardine SaadLos AngelesGetty ImagesD4vd has not been charged or officially named as a suspect in the caseNewly unsealed court filings have revealed that US singer D4vd - real name David Anthony Burke - is the target of a grand jury investigation into the apparent murder of a 14-year-old girl, whose remains were found in his car in September.The filings were released after D4vd's family were summoned by a California court to testify before the grand jury.Dawud Burke, D4vd's father, fought against the summons in a Texas court, and in doing so included portions of material from the California case that had not been previously available to the public.The filings confirm that D4vd has been identified as a \"target\" of a grand jury investigation in Los Angeles and that he may be subject to proceedings for one count of murder.He has not been charged or officially named as a suspect in the case and an indictment has not been announced. Grand jury proceedings remain ongoing, according to US media. D4vd has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.A lawyer for the singer did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.Warning - this story contains content that some may find distressingThe unsealed court filings mark the latest chapter in a case which has been dissected by internet sleuths for months.On 8 September 2025, investigators found the decomposed head and torso of 14-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez in a cadaver bag in the front boot of a Tesla car registered to D4vd's address in Texas, the court documents said.When they removed the bag, they discovered severed arms and legs in a black bag, the documents said.D4vd - who released his debut album in April - was on tour when the remains were discovered.Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesCeleste Rivas Hernandez, of Lake Elsinore, California, was reported missing before she was found dead and dismemberedPolice had previously said that they discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded car after responding to reports of a foul odour at the Hollywood tow yard.Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner. The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators have said.A police spokesperson previously said that the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division.As the grand jury proceedings got under way last year, the court filings said that prosecutors believed the testimony of D4vd's family was \"material and necessary\" to the investigation. But Dawud Burke, along with his wife Colleen and son Caleb, have argued that the summons violates their right to due process because the notice they received from the California court contained redacted information, according to Texas court transcripts included in the filings.\"The Court ordered Mr. Burke to travel across the country to appear before a California grand jury without ever allowing him to see the full documents that justified the extraordinary compulsion,\" Dawud Burke's attorney said in the filing.He challenged the California court's out-of-state subpoena, which he believed was compelling him to travel against his will.Los Angeles Police Department detectives travelled to Texas to bring the singer's family to California to appear before the grand jury, whose proceedings are secret, court records said.The related documents have provided the biggest tranche of information about the case thus far, delineating key details in the ongoing investigation, which has been shrouded in secrecy.In November, the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Rivas Hernandez's death could be released or posted on its website.The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers \"receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public\".Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is \"virtually unheard of in other counties\" and \"has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system\".The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHarry SekulichandPaul Kirby,Europe digital editorGetty ImagesHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says he has stationed soldiers at key energy facilities across the country after he blamed Ukraine for disrupting energy supplies.Orban, who is trailing in opinion polls ahead of pivotal elections next month, has accused Kyiv of imposing an \"oil blockade\" on Hungary by deliberately delaying the reopening of the Druzhba pipeline.Ukraine says the pipeline was damaged by Russian strikes last month and its repair crews have been injured by further attacks.Druzhba is the main route for delivering Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia and shipments of Russian oil to both countries have been cut off since 27 January.The Hungarian leader, who is seen as Russia's closest partner in the EU, argues the suspension of the critical oil flow is purely political and has accused Ukraine of \"preparing further actions\", including sabotage, four years into Russia's full-scale war.However, Orban's critics say he has been stepping up the war of words with Ukraine in order to convince the public that Hungary is under attack in the run-up to the 12 April vote. Most opinion polls suggest his Fidesz party is at risk of losing power after 16 years.This week he vetoed a €90bn (£78bn) EU loan to Ukraine and blocked the 20th package of sanctions on Moscow.In an open letter on social media on Thursday, he accused Ukraine, the EU and opposition parties of \"co-ordinating efforts to bring a pro-Ukraine government to power in Hungary\".The EU has urged Kyiv to speed up reopening the pipeline, but Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky said \"they advise us to repair it, but they know that there have already been attacks on Druzhba\".Slovakia's leader Robert Fico, also seen as one of Russia's closest European partners, has accused Zelensky of stalling. On Monday, his government said it would stop providing emergency power supplies to Ukraine until oil supplies resumed through the pipeline.Ukraine has had to increase imports from its European neighbours because of acute power shortages throughout the winter caused by intensified Russian attacks on its electricity and gas networks.The European Commission made clear on Wednesday that while Hungary and Slovakia had begun using their emergency oil supplies there was no risk of a shortages and there were alternative sources for both countries.\"Croatia confirmed... that non-Russian crude oil is being transported through the Adria pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia,\" European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said after experts met to discuss the situation. \"It remains the main alternative pipeline for Hungary and Slovakia to cover their needs, and the pipeline has sufficient capacity to increase volumes to fully cover the Hungarian Slovakian requirements,\" she said. Ukraine's military has repeatedly attacked Russian oil facilities inside Russia itself, and a Ukrainian drone strike hit an oil pumping station in Tatarstan earlier this week.The attacks forced Russia's oil operator to reduce the amount of crude oil it takes into its system by about 250,000 barrels a day, according to Reuters news agency.In his message on Thursday, Orban accused Zelensky of blocking the Druzhba pipeline as an \"anti-Hungarian policy\", a day after he accused Kyiv of \"preparing further actions to disrupt Hungary's energy system\".Following a meeting of the Hungarian Defence Council on Wednesday, he said soldiers had been deployed to energy stations, police would patrol power stations, and drones were banned in Hungary's north-east border region with Ukraine.There is no indication that Ukraine is planning any kind of attack, and its armed forces are already severely stretched in a four-year full-scale Russian invasion along a front line of about 1,200km (750 miles).Zelensky did not immediately respond to the accusation, however Orban has long sought to portray Kyiv as trying to drag Hungary into the war, and he has repeatedly tried to block financial aid to Ukraine.",

    "body": "6 hours agoChris EwokorBBC Africa, AbujaGetty ImagesChimamanda Ngozi Adichie had twin boys, via a surrogate, in 2024An inquest into the death of Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son will formally begin on 14 April.The date was set during a preliminary hearing at the Yaba Magistrate Court in Lagos, roughly seven weeks after Nkanu Nnamdi Esege died at a Euracare hospital.Adiche and her family have accused Euracare of negligence, saying medics denied Nkanu oxygen and gave him too much sedation, causing a cardiac arrest.The hospital expressed its \"deepest sympathies\" over the death but denied wrongdoing, saying its care had been in line with international standards.During the preliminary hearing on Wednesday, Magistrate Atinuke Adetunji directed all parties to file witness statements ahead of the inquest.The court is expected to hear evidence from medical experts and hospital representatives as the coroner seeks to establish the circumstances and cause of Nkanu's death.According to submissions made to the court by Adichie's legal team, Nkanu had initially been admitted to Atlantis Hospital in Lagos with what was described as a worsening but mild illness. Plans had been made to transfer him to the United States for further treatment at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital.But first, Atlantis Hospital referred the toddler to Euracare for pre-flight investigations, including an MRI and a spinal tap, or lumbar puncture. He died on 7 January after undergoing these procedures.In a legal notice three days later, lawyers for Adichie and her husband, Dr Ivara Esege, accused Euracare of breaching the duty of care owed to the child. The hospital denied this allegation.Adichie, 48, is an award-winning writer known for a string of internationally successful novels, such as Half of a Yellow Sun and Americanah.She was born and raised in Nigeria but is now based in the US.Adichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Nkanu was one of twin boys born in 2024, using a surrogate.More about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Girl, 14, shot dead as South Africa's 'taxi wars' hit school3 hours agoWycliffe MuiaGeach/Gallo Images via Getty Images)South Africa's competitive and lucrative taxi industry has been plagued by violence for years Police in South Africa are investigating a fatal shooting at a secondary school in the coastal city of Cape Town that killed a 14-year-old pupil and a taxi operator.An unidentified man opened fire on a taxi as the driver waited to pick up pupils on Wednesday, shooting the driver, another man and two children, police said. Two pupils, aged 14 and 16, were also injured in the attack, which has been linked to long-running deadly turf wars between rival taxi associations. \"It is unacceptable that our children continue to be exposed to danger as a result of ongoing conflict within the taxi industry,\" said Isaac Sileku, a senior Western Cape official. Violence has plagued South Africa's highly competitive and lucrative taxi industry for decades.While minibus taxis continue to dominate the market, the rise of e-hailing services is increasing tensions, leading to violent and sometimes deadly clashes between operators.On Thursday, Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the local authority was offering a reward of up to 100,000 rand (£4,600; $6,400) for information that leads to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the shooting.Wednesday's attack took place as students at Atlantis Senior Secondary were leaving school, when gunshots rang out and sparked panic.Police arrived at the scene and found a minibus taxi parked outside the school, with the body of a 42-year-old a taxi operator inside. He had multiple gunshot wounds.In the school grounds, officers discovered the body of a 14-year-old girl who had been shot multiple times in the chest. Police said she had been shot while attempting to run from the gunfire.\"A 14-year-old learner [female] sustained a gunshot wound to her back. Another 16-year-old female was grazed by a bullet,\" said police spokesperson FC van Wyk.He said it was not yet clear how many gunmen were involved, adding that detectives and officers from the Taxi Violence Investigations Unit were investigating the attack.This was the second attempt on the taxi operator's life this month, local media reported.In a statement, the Western Cape regional authorities condemned the \"senseless act\", saying \"no learner should ever face danger while travelling to or from school\". \"Violence of this nature undermines community safety, disrupts education, and instils fear among residents,\" it added. Sileku said the safety of commuters and learners \"is non-negotiable and must never be compromised by [taxi] industry conflict\". \"We also urge law enforcement agencies to act decisively to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice swiftly.\"More about South Africa from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

If Washington \"respects our present [nuclear] position as stipulated in the Constitution... and withdraws its hostile policy... there is no reason why we cannot get along well with the United States,\" Kim said at the Ninth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, according to state media outlet KCNA.The future state of US-North Korea relations \"depends entirely on the US attitude\", Kim said.\"Whether it's peaceful coexistence or permanent confrontation, we are ready for either, and the choice is not ours to make.\"He also addressed its neighbour South Korea, saying that it would \"permanently exclude Seoul from the category of compatriots\", adding that \"as long as South Korea cannot escape the geopolitical conditions of having a border with us, the only way to live safely is to give up everything related to us and leave us alone\".One analyst told AFP that Pyongyang's latest remarks signalled \"an intention to pursue relations with the US independently, without going through South Korea.\"Kim also highlighted Pyongyang's nuclear programme, saying: \"We will focus on projects to increase the number of nuclear weapons and expand nuclear operational means.\"Despite long-standing international sanctions, North Korea has continued to build its nuclear capabilities, regularly testing banned intercontinental missiles.State-run KCNA said this week that under Kim's leadership North Korea \"radically improved\" its \"war deterrence\", \"with the nuclear forces as its pivot\".The secrecy of the regime, however, makes it difficult to evaluate how much progress its military has actually made.Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), an independent think tank, estimated last year that North Korea had around 50 assembled nuclear warheads and enough fissile material to produce up to 40 more.Kim also previously called for a \"limitless\" expansion of the country's nuclear programme in November 2024.Last year, US President Trump released a global security road map that conspicuously did not mention the denuclearisation of North Korea as a goal - despite that being a constant in the National Security Strategy of every US president since 2003, when Pyongyang's nuclear programme emerged.The omission fuelled speculation that talks between Trump and Kim, last held in 2019, could soon be revived.Trump's previous road map, issued during his first term in 2017, mentioned North Korea 16 times - describing it as a threat and a rogue state that could \"use a nuclear weapon against the United States\".Kim, however, has long insisted that denuclearisation is not something Pyongyang is considering.\"The concept of 'denuclearisation' has already lost its meaning. We have become a nuclear state,\" he told parliament in September. \"I say 'denuclearisation' is the last, last thing to expect from us.\"\"If the United States, freeing itself from its absurd pursuit of others' denuclearisation and recognising the reality, wants genuine peaceful coexistence with us, there is no reason for us not to come face to face with it.\"ReutersKim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, was photographed alongside him at the party congressPhotos from the closing stages of this year's party congress also showed Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, standing alongside her father in a matching black leather jacket at a military parade in Pyongyang.Earlier this month South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers Kim had selected Ju Ae - who is believed to be 13 - as his heir.The National Intelligence Service said it would would keep close tabs on whether she attended the party congress.",

    "body": "29 minutes agoJames FitzGeraldThe BBC's Nada Tawfik reports from Chappaqua, New York on what to expect from the Clintons' deposition.Hillary Clinton is appearing before a panel of the US House of Representatives that is investigating the crimes of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The former Democratic secretary of state and presidential candidate recently agreed, along with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to testify to the House Oversight Committee. Both had previously resisted demands to appear, describing them as politically motivated. Their agreement to testify warded off potential contempt-of-Congress proceedings against them.Hillary Clinton has said she does not recall meeting or speaking to Epstein. Her husband, who did know Epstein, has denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of Epstein's crimes.Watch: The BBC interviews Hillary Clinton last week about Epstein linksBill Clinton has said he cut off ties with Epstein two decades ago, and has voiced regret that he was ever associated with the financier, who died in 2019. He is expected to provide testimony of his own on Friday.In an interview with the BBC last week in Berlin, Germany, Hillary Clinton said the deposition was a Republican ruse to divert attention from questions about Trump's association with Epstein.\"We have nothing to hide,\" she said. \"We have called for the full release of these files repeatedly. We think sunlight is the best disinfectant.\"She maintained that she never met Epstein, but did meet his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, \"on a few occasions\". Maxwell attended the wedding of the couple's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, in 2010 in New York.The couple's announcement in recent weeks that they would provide testimony after all marked a reversal of their defiant position, and came as a potential contempt vote loomed in the House. Some Democratic members of the committee voted in favour of initiating contempt proceedings.The Clintons have previously accused the panel's Republican leader, James Comer, of \"partisan politics\" in his handling of the investigation. They described the legal summonses as \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".They insisted that they had already submitted sworn statements that covered the \"limited information\" they had on Epstein.Nonetheless, they would appear, said a spokesperson for Bill Clinton, and \"they look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone\". For his part, Comer said the effort to secure a deposition from both of the Clintons was a bipartisan move to show that \"no-one is above the law\". Bill Clinton appears in text and photos that have recently been released in stages by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) in its disclosure of material that was uncovered during federal investigations into Epstein's crimes. The files more broadly reveal the extent of Epstein's connections with multiple high-profile individuals, including after he was convicted of sex crimes.As with others who appear in the files - including the current president Donald Trump, who previously had his own association with Epstein - appearing in the documents does not imply any wrongdoing.The Clintons' hearings will take place in Chappaqua, New York, near their home. Such depositions normally occur behind closed doors, though the Clintons fought for their own testimony to be public so that selective portions of their evidence could not be leaked to the media.Both Democratic and Republican members of the committee are expected to address reporters after Hillary Clinton's deposition, which is scheduled for 11:00 EST (16:00 GMT).The highly anticipated appearance by Bill Clinton on Friday will represent the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.",

    "body": "1 day agoLyse DoucetChief international correspondent EPADonald Trump says he prefers to do a deal with Iran rather than unleash a deadly warIn a world on edge waiting to see what US President Donald Trump does next in the Middle East, he provided no clear signal when he presented the longest ever State of the Union address.The world's most powerful commander-in-chief decided not to make his comprehensive case for possible military action against Iran during the biggest build-up of American might in the Middle East since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq.Two decades ago, President George W Bush had travelled across America, and beyond, to lay the groundwork for what turned into a major military intervention, albeit one based on faulty intelligence.Trump may have decided it was not an issue to broach when his political base, who elected him to stay out of forever wars, is far more focused on the state of the economy and the fight on immigration just months before crucial midterm polls.Or it may reflect his repeated claim that he has yet to make up his own mind about which path to pursue. He continues to say he prefers to do a deal rather than unleash a deadly war.The next crucial round of negotiations - the third this month - in Geneva on Thursday is expected to be pivotal to his decision-making.\"If President Trump does not receive, through his envoys, an acceptable text from Tehran, he's likely to order some form of military action soon after,\" assessed a diplomat who's been briefed on this process.The president who has repeatedly changed his messaging on his end game in Iran - veering from narrow nuclear issues to wider regime change - highlighted one of his consistent demands in his speech: \"We haven't heard from them those secret words: 'We do not want nuclear weapons ever'.\"Yet, just hours earlier, Iran's foreign minister and top nuclear negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, reiterated on X almost that exact phrase: \"Iran will under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon.\"It's the convincing proof, to allay suspicion that Tehran has been moving in that direction, that is a key issue in the ongoing talks mediated by the Gulf state of Oman.Iran has indicated it is ready to compromise on its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of the sanctions crippling its economy.It was spiralling prices and a collapsing currency that sparked a wave of unrest in January put down with immense force.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has put its confirmed death toll at more than 7,000, including 6,488 protesters, and is still investigating reports of thousands more deaths. The Iranian government insists that figure is around 3,100.In his speech, Trump said it appeared the authorities had \"killed at least, it looks like, 32,000 protesters\".Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai immediately denounced the president's remarks on the death toll as \"big lies\".Kenny Holston/The New York Times/Pool via REUTERSIran accused Trump of repeating \"big lies\" during his State of the Union addressTrump also raised, for the first time, the charge that Iran was \"working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States\". He seemed to suggest that this was another red line.Iran has repeatedly rejected the inclusion of its ballistic missile programme in the negotiations.\"When we were attacked by Israelis and Americans, our missiles came to our rescue so how can we accept depriving ourselves of our defensive capabilities,\" deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, a leading member of the negotiating team, told the BBC in an interview in Tehran this month.This next round, involving Trump's top envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, are expected to provide greater clarity about where the gaps lie, and whether they can be closed. Both sides know the clock is counting down.\"Washington and Tehran have been locked in last ditch diplomacy for decades,\" remarks Ellie Geranmayeh, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\"What's different now is the largest ever American military build-up against Iran, a proven willingness by both sides to go head to head, and the worst crisis of legitimacy for the Islamic Republic including the threat of regime change.\"ReutersThe USS Gerald R Ford is one of two aircraft carriers being deployed in the Middle EastThere are clear differences in this round of talks compared to the five rounds last year shattered by Israel's attack on Iran, which turned into a 12-day war and saw the US carry out strikes on three key Iranian nuclear sites.This time, Rafael Grossi, who heads the world's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has been far more involved in the very detailed technical discussions essential to any nuclear agreement, including robust inspections.And Iran is now offering new proposals such as diluting its highly enriched uranium which, at 60% purity, is dangerously close to weapons grade.Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and a senior adviser to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is also closely involved in this track.\"It's clear that the negotiators on both sides want to do a deal. But what's not clear is what the main decision-makers are ready to accept,\" observed one source.With hours to go until the focus shifts to the negotiating table, the question still hovers ominously.Will Trump accept a narrow deal on Iran's nuclear programme that many believe is still difficult but could be doable?How far will Khamenei be willing to compromise on key issues at a time when the Islamic Republic has never been under a greater external and internal threat?",

    "body": "Australian scientists have discovered a new native bee species with tiny horns - and given it a suitably devilish name. Researchers found the Megachile Lucifer while observing a rare wildflower that only grows in the Bremer Ranges in Western Australia's Goldfields region, 470km (292 miles) east of Perth.The \"highly distinctive, prominent horns\" are only on the female bee and may be used as a defence mechanism, to gather pollen or nectar, or to collect materials such as resin for nests.The study's lead scientist said she was inspired to use the name Lucifer as she was watching the Netflix show of the same name at the time. She adds it is the first new member of this bee group in 20 years. \"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" said Dr Kit Prendergast from Curtin University .\"When writing up the new species description I was watching the Netflix show Lucifer at the time, and the name just fit perfectly. I am also a huge fan of the Netflix character Lucifer so it was a no-brainer.\"Lucifer - which means \"light bringer\" in Latin - is also a reference to shining light on the need for better conservation of native bee species and greater understanding of how endangered plants are pollinated, she said. The report, which was published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, also called for the area in and around where the new bee species and rare wildflowers were found to be \"formally protected and gazetted as conservation land that cannot be cleared\".\"Because the new species was found in the same small area as the endangered wildflower, both could be at risk from habitat disturbance and other threatening processes like climate change,\" she said, adding that many mining companies do not include native bees when assessing the environmental impact of their operations.\"So we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems.\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realise they're there.\"",

Officials have not confirmed the number of casualties, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier offered his condolences to \"our martyrs\".Search and rescue efforts have begun at the scene. The number on board included flight crew, officials said.The defence ministry said the C-130 cargo plane had been travelling from  Azerbaijan to Turkey. Images from the scene show emergency services on site and what appears to be wreckage from the plane. According to BBC Turkish, Georgia's aviation authority said the aircraft disappeared from radar without issuing a distress signal.Georgia's interior ministry said the plane crashed near Sighnaghi, around 5km (3 miles) from Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said in a message to Erdogan he was \"deeply saddened by the tragic news of the loss of servicemen\", and extended condolences to him and the people of Turkey. The US ambassador to Turkey, Tom Barrack, said on X he was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash.\"We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the fallen, the Turkish Armed Forces, and the people of Türkiye,\" he added.The C-130 is a US-made transport plane used by air forces around the world.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiSchools in Delhi have been asked to run hybrid classes for primary students and non-essential construction activity has been banned as air quality worsens in the Indian capital.On Tuesday, authorities enforced stricter anti-pollution measures which include limiting movement of goods carriers in the capital and its suburbs. Delhi's air quality has deteriorated to \"severe\" levels according to authorities, which can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases. On Wednesday, the capital's PM2.5 levels in the air reached 438, according to the Central Pollution Control Board -  dangerously high concentrations of fine particles that can clog the lungs.This is nearly 30 times higher than the World Health Organisation's safe limit and about eight times higher than India's national average. The WHO considers a 24-hour average of no more than 15 to be safe.Doctors have advised people - especially children and the elderly - to avoid going outdoors unless absolutely necessary and to wear protective masks if they do.Toxic air quality is a recurring problem in Delhi and across parts of northern India during the winter. There isn't a single cause behind the problem, but a mix of factors like low wind speeds, industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, dropping temperatures and the seasonal burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states.The Delhi government enforces a set of special measures known as the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to contain pollution levels.  Stage three of these measures were implemented on Tuesday which include a ban on mining activity, stone crushing and prohibiting movement of vehicles carrying dust-generating materials among other things. The worsening air quality led to a people's protest in the capital last weekend, and has also sparked a political row. On Tuesday, Saurabh Bhardwaj, a leader of of the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) accused the Delhi government of \"manipulating\" air quality data and failing to protect public health.He said that the city's air quality remains \"alarming\" despite the alleged manipulation of numbers and urged the government to declare a public health emergency.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Delhi government, however, has denied the allegations.\"Our government is working with full seriousness and promptness towards pollution control,\" Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said.Delhi Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told Hindustan Times that air quality data is publicly available and that water was sprinkled near air quality monitors only to reduce dust, not to manipulate readings.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "15 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad and Dearbail JordanPakistan: Suicide attack outside Islamabad court kills 12A suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad has killed 12 people and injured at least 27 others, the country's interior minister said.Mohsin Naqvi said a bomber was planning to attack the district courthouse but was unable to get inside.Naqvi said authorities would prioritise identifying the bomber, and that those involved would be brought to justice.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that extremist groups \"actively backed by India\" were involved.A spokesperson for the Indian government denied what they described as \"baseless and unfounded allegations\".In a statement, Sharif said that \"terrorist attacks on unarmed citizens of Pakistan by India's terrorist proxies are condemnable\".Jumaat Ul Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), has claimed responsibility, according to local media. But two local journalists have told the BBC that the TTP's central leadership has sent messages to them saying it has no link to the explosion.Suicide blasts in Islamabad have been rare in recent years. Footage from the scene on Tuesday showed the remains of a burnt-out car and a police cordon in place.The 27 people injured are receiving medical treatment, Naqvi said.He added that the attacker detonated the bomb close to a police car after waiting for up to 15 minutes. Footage of the aftermath showed plumes of smoke rising from a charred vehicle behind a security barrier. The incident occurred at 12:39 local time (07:39 GMT).Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said he \"strongly condemned the suicide blast\". A lawyer who said he was parking his car outside the court at the time described hearing a \"loud bang\".Rustam Malik told AFP news agency \"it was complete chaos\".\"Lawyers and people were running inside the complex,\" he added. \"I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate and several cars were on fire.\"Police cordoned off an area close to a district court in Islamabad after the blastIn a separate incident on Monday, a car exploded in India's capital Delhi, killing eight people and injuring a number of others. The Indian government has not called the incident a terror attack, although the case has been referred to the country's anti-terror body.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said following the attack: \"The conspirators behind this heinous act will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice, no matter how deep the conspiracy runs.\"There is, however, no official word yet on what led to the blast.The last time Pakistan's capital was targeted by a suicide bombing was three years ago when a police officer was killed and several others injured.There have been suicide attacks in other parts of the country in the years since but not in Islamabad.

    "body": "8 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseA US naval strike force centred around the world's largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, has arrived in the Caribbean, the US Navy has confirmed. The arrival of the strike group, which was ordered to the region by President Donald Trump last month, comes amid ongoing strikes against alleged drug boats and tensions with Venezuela. The US has so far carried out at least 19 strikes against boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, killing at least 76 people. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials have accused the US of \"fabricating\" a crisis and seeking to topple the country's left-wing socialist government. The aircraft carrier movement also comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\".Petro on Tuesday ordered his country's public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US agencies until the boat attacks in the Caribbean stop.He wrote on X that the fight against drugs \"must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".In a statement, the US Navy said that the strike group entered the area of responsibility of US Southern Command - which oversees Latin America and the Caribbean - on 11 November. The force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which itself includes more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of aircraft. The strike force also includes guided-missile destroyers and various other vessels. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the force will \"bolster US capacity to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit actors and activities that disrupt the safety and prosperity\" of the US and will help \"disrupt narcotics trafficking\" and criminal groups in the region. The carrier group is joining substantial military forces already deployed in the region, including thousands of troops, a nuclear-powered submarine and military aircraft based in Puerto Rico. Collectively, they form the largest US presence arrayed in and around Latin America in decades. The US has continued to launch strikes on alleged drug boats in the region. The Trump administration says the attacks are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US. Earlier this week, the US announced it had conducted two additional strikes in the Pacific, killing six people. In addition to fueling tensions with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela, the strikes have led to concerns from some observers about violations of human rights and due process. Colombia's Petro has also faced criticism as well as US sanctions over his reluctant response to drug-trafficking groups. On Tuesday, Colombia's military officers revealed that they had launched their own deadly airstrikes against a drug-running guerrilla group in the Amazon region, killing 19, AFP reported.Earlier in November, Trump downplayed suggestions he was planning to topple the Venezuelan government or start a war. In an interview with CBS - the BBC's US news partner - Trump said that \"every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\" ",

    "body": "30 minutes agoAbdujalil AbdurasulovIn KyivThick fog has enabled Russian troops to move further into the key strategic city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's 7th Airborne Assault Corps says weather conditions, particularly dense fog, have prompted Moscow to intensify its bid to get increasing numbers into the ruined city and encircle Ukrainian forces.Russian forces have spent more than a year trying to seize the city. Ukraine's military says there may now be 300-500 Russians there and President Voloydymyr Zelensky says the situation remains difficult.Meanwhile, army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi says the situation on the front line in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region has \"significantly worsened\", with the loss of three settlements.Syrskyi said however that Russia was most active around Pokrovsk. A video has gone viral on social media showing Russian soldiers openly driving through a hazy road on civilian cars and motorbikes.The BBC has verified the location where the video was filmed as the southern outskirts of the town on the Selidove-Pokrovsk highway.For several days fog obscured visibility to carry out aerial reconnaissance, says a drone pilot from the \"Shershni Dovbusha\" unit of the 68th brigade with the call-sign \"Goose\".That's why, he told the BBC, the Russians had even \"dared\" to launch assaults using a column of vehicles, which would normally have been wiped out immediately by Ukrainian drones.The Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC his unit had regularly detected and eliminated small Russian groups trying to advance on foot and on motor bikes.  He added they were also involved in repelling the attack featured in the viral video, said to have been filmed on Sunday.The convoy was partly destroyed, \"Goose\" claims, however weather conditions meant there was no video monitoring of the moment they repelled the attack so he was not sure if the entire group was hit.A week ago, Zelensky estimated that up to 300 Russian soldiers were fighting in Pokrovsk. The video suggests those numbers have probably increased in that time and the military confirmed that on Wednesday, with southern areas of the city now under Russian occupation.Russian troops appear to be closing in on most areas of Pokrovsk, according to mapping by the Ukraine-based DeepState monitoring group. Some observers say that its fall is imminent.Most parts of the city are now in a grey zone that neither side fully controls, says \"Goose\". \"We might hold positions in one building, but the enemy can be in the next one. They're trying to get behind our backs,\" he says.Moscow is trying to encircle Pokrovsk and neighbouring Myrnohrad in what is known as a \"cauldron\".  Even if the \"lid\" is not closed, Russians can constantly target all routes in and out of it using FPV drones.To prevent such an encirclement, Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian troops back from Suvorove and Rodynske on the eastern part of the \"cauldron\", creating a bigger gap between Russian flanks.Russian forces are trying to cut off logistical routes supporting Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk.  They attack supply routes, not only remotely using drones and artillery but also by sending in soldiers on the ground, the Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC.This tactic is called infiltration and it has proved quite successful, says Ukrainian military analyst Kostyantyn Mashovets.He argues that Russian forces have specifically targeted Ukrainian FPV pilots so they do not have sufficient resources to detect the movement of smaller Russian groups.  In an urban environment, Russian soldiers sometimes infiltrate by dressing up as locals or as Ukrainian military, says Mashovets.  Their main goal is to cause chaos among Ukrainian defenders, which is then followed by a push from the main forces of the Russian army, he adds.The Kremlin is also trying to push in other parts of the front line – in Kupyansk in the north-east and in Zapporizhzhya region in the south.Viktor Tregubov, spokesperson of the Joint Forces Operation, denied Moscow's claim that they had managed to surround Kupyansk but admitted that Russian troops were present in the south of the town and the situation was difficult.",

    "body": "15 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorThe prosecutor in Turkey's biggest city has accused popular mayor Ekrem Imamoglu of 142 corruption offences that command jail terms ranging from 828 to 2,352 years.Imamoglu, considered the main political rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been in pre-trial custody since March on suspicion of corruption.The Istanbul mayor and his opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) deny any wrongdoing and accuse the president and his allies of launching a crackdown in response to Erdogan's decline in popularity.However, the city's chief prosecutor has targeted not just Imamoglu but 401 others, with allegations of running a criminal corruption network with the mayor as its \"founder and leader\".After an eight-month inquiry, prosecutor Akin Gürlek said the suspects, of whom 105 were in detention, had formed an enormous criminal organisation that had been engaged in taking and receiving bribes as well as money laundering.The cost in losses to the Turkish state amounted to 160bn lira (£2,9bn; $3.8bn), he said.Imamoglu, who is the secular CHP's candidate for presidential elections in 2028, has been cited on 12 counts of bribery, seven counts of money laundering from criminal proceeds and a further seven counts of fraud against public institutions and organisations.Anadolu news agency estimated the charges would carry a prison sentence of 2,430 years.The mayor's detention in March triggered widespread protests, hundreds of arrests and a police crackdown. Ever since, he has been held in Marmara prison on the outskirts of Istanbul. Apart from the corruption case, prosecutors have accused him of a raft of other offences including espionage and forging his university diploma, a qualification that has since been annulled.Turkish authorities deny the mayor's allegation that the judiciary is being used as a political tool. However, without a university diploma he cannot stand for the presidency in 2028.Party leader Özgür Özel wrote on X: \"This case is not legal, it is entirely political. Its purpose is to stop the CHP, which came first in the last elections, and to block its presidential candidate.\"He earlier told a meeting of the CHP's parliamentary group as that no-one else in their party would run for the presidency: \"His crime is to run for the next presidency of this country. He has no other crime!\"Imamoglu, 54, was first elected mayor in 2019 and he was re-elected in April 2024, defeating the governing AK Party candidate by almost a million votes.He has already appealed against a July jail term of a year and eight months for insulting and threatening the Istanbul prosecutor. He is also appealing against an earlier jail sentence for criticising election officials.The espionage case, launched two weeks ago, alleges that Imamoglu handed over data of Istanbul residents in return for international funding.Imamoglu has warned Turks to \"forget this espionage nonsense\".Party leader Özgür Özel has accused authorities of trying to invent offences to prevent the mayor's release from prison.\"Could he have committed electoral fraud, had a fake diploma, been a thief, a terrorist and a spy at the same time?\" he asked his parliamentary colleagues on Tuesday.",

    "body": "'This animal spared my life': Biologist bitten in head by shark hopes to meet it again16 hours agoRafael AbuchaibeBBC News MundoMauricio HoyosMauricio Hoyos has spent 30 years studying the behaviour of different shark speciesMauricio Hoyos still remembers the pressure that the jaws of a female Galapagos shark, over 3m (10ft) in length, exerted on his skull.The animal had lunged at him with astonishing speed, giving him barely enough time to duck his head in a last ditch effort to protect his jugular vein.\"When it closed its jaw, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then, after what I think was a second, it opened it again and it let me go,\" Hoyos told BBC Mundo from his home in Baja California, Mexico, a little over month after surviving the incident.Hoyos, a marine biologist with over 30 years of experience studying sharks in their natural habitat, was on a research trip in Costa Rica when he was attacked by the shark in September.Less than two months on, and still bearing the scars from the attack on his face, he describes his recovery as \"incredible\" - and says he even hopes to encounter his assailant again.Hoyos calls the shark bite \"a battle scar that looks like gills\"For Hoyos, what happened to him that day in the waters off Cocos Island is the result of normal animal behaviour when confronted with a perceived threat. \"In this case, this bite was like a dog's,\" he says.\"Have you ever seen how dogs, when another dog gets too close, throw a quick bite? It doesn't hurt it, but it calms the other dog down.\"Hoyos - who along with his colleagues attaches acoustic tags to sharks to help pinpoint their mating and spawning grounds as part of his work - was alerted to the shark's presence in the water by tourists.It was at a depth of 40m, and Hoyos told the captain of the boat he was on that he would be there \"for a maximum of five minutes\".He then entered the water and began his slow descent.Getty ImagesGalapagos sharks can grow 3m in lengthHoyos recalls encountering the shark: \"This giant female, measuring between 3 and 3.5m (11.5ft), swam by and headed toward the bottom, and I positioned myself to tag her at the base of her dorsal fin.\"But Hoyos, who has tagged many kinds of sharks in his decades-long career, says this animal reacted differently to others.\"Obviously the tip - the metal tip attached to the cable hanging from the probe - goes in, and unlike the other sharks I've tagged that immediately flee, she turns around and stares at me,\" he recalls.\"I saw her little eye looking at me, and I saw her very calmly turning around.\"Hoyos and his colleagues tag sharks with probes like this oneHoyos says he held the shark's gaze as it swam away - but then, suddenly, out of nowhere, it lunged at him.\"I lowered my head, and what I felt was its lower jaw digging into my cheek and its upper jaw into my head. I was there, I imagine for a second, no more, inside its jaw, and then it simply opened it again.\"\"When it closed it, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then it just let me go,\" he marvels.The Galapagos shark's 29 serrated teeth not only left Hoyos with deep wounds to his face and head, but also severed the air line of his diving apparatus.He had survived the shark attack but was still in mortal danger.In addition, one of the teeth had torn his diving mask, and the blood-tinged water was further blurring his already limited visibility.\"When I realised that no air was coming out of the hose, I grabbed a second one we have, which we call an octopus, that is used to give air to someone else if they need it,\" he tells BBC Mundo. \"But then I realised that the regulator wasn't working and was blowing air instead of regulating it, so I had to remember my training and start regulating it with my lips.\"Bleeding, blinded, and with the air escaping, Hoyos calculated that he had less than a minute to reach the surface.\"Since I couldn't see anything, what I did was look for the light that I knew was the surface. I started swimming upwards, in a very coordinated manner, because I wanted to avoid erratic movements that would attract the shark.\"Mauricio HoyosHoyos had to use all the lessons he had learned during years of diving to survive the attackAfter Hoyos reached the surface, a young man pulled him aboard the boat, and when the captain saw his condition, he called the park ranger station to report the incident.Hoyos explained that he didn't feel the pain of his injuries until much later.\"Obviously, I had adrenaline in my system, but the bite didn't hurt that much. What hurt the most was the impact: when the shark bit me - an animal 3m long and at that speed - it was like being hit by a car. In fact, I ended up with a huge bruise all over my jaw; I thought it was broken.\"When they docked, a team of paramedics was ready to provide him with emergency care.Hoyos was lucky: as well as surviving the attack and the subsequent ascent, none of his wounds became infected, and the healing process took less time than anyone could have imagined.\"The doctors told me it was amazing: the attack happened on 27 [September], I had a 34-hour trip, they performed a surgical debridement [removing damaged tissue], and two days later they were already evaluating whether they could perform reconstructive surgery.\"It could have been far worse for Hoyos. According to the doctors, a young man who survived a Galapagos shark attack in the same area in 2017 had to remain in a hyperbaric chamber for almost a month because his wounds weren't healing properly.\"They told me my recovery had been incredible. After the surgery, the doctors confessed how worried they had been about an infection, because being on my face, it was a direct path to the brain.\"Mauricio HoyosSmiling broadly, Hoyos adds that he is already planning to get back into the water and has a diving trip booked for 14 November.And he says that after having survived an attack of this magnitude he has even more respect for the animals he studies.\"Many people think the oceans would be better off without sharks, but they really say that because they don't understand the crucial role sharks play in maintaining their delicate balance.\"Pointing to the large scar on his cheek, he says: \"This is the proof that this female spared my life; I can't put it any other way. And this will allow me to continue speaking well of sharks and advocating for their conservation in the future.\"Meanwhile, the Galapagos shark that had Hoyos in its jaws continues its natural life in the depths, and he hopes to see it again. And since he was able to mark it before it attacked him, that possibility exists.\"In January I'm going to Cocos Island, we have a trip from the 20 to 27. And obviously I'm going to Roca Sucia [where the attack happened], I'm going to dive down there,\" he says, undeterred.",

    "body": "Wife and son of Gabon's ousted leader given 20-year jail terms in two-day corruption trial24 minutes agoFavour Nunoo,BBC Africa and Basillioh RukangaA court in Gabon has sentenced the former first lady and the son of deposed President Ali Bongo to 20 years in jail following a two-day trial.On Tuesday night, Sylvia Bongo and Noureddin Bongo were found guilty of embezzlement and corruption after a trial that began a day earlier in their absence.They were both fined 100m CFA francs ($177,000; £135,000), with Noureddin ordered to pay an extra 1.2tn CFA francs ($2.1; £1.6bn) for financial damages suffered by the Gabonese state.They were accused of exploiting Ali Bongo's condition after he suffered a stroke in 2018 to run Gabon for their own personal profit. They denied the charges ahead of their trial, describing it as \"a legal farce.\"Ali Bongo was ousted in an August 2023 coup led by Brice Oligui Nguema, who has since shed his military uniform and was elected president earlier this year.Following the military takeover, Bongo's wife and son were detained in Gabon for 20 months before being released in May and permitted to leave the country for London on medical grounds. The former president is not facing prosecution and was also released from house arrest where he had reportedly remained, although Gabonese authorities said he was free to move about as he wished.Gabonese state prosecutor Eddy Minang on Monday told the court that they were \"surprised\" not to see the former first lady and her son in court as the trial began.Despite the sentencing of the two, the trial of the other accused will continue until Friday, local reporters have told the BBC. Nine other co-accused, former allies of the Bongos, were present in court at the start of the trial, according to reports.The Bongo family ruled Gabon for more than five decades. Ali Bongo was in power for 14 years before he was ousted. He had succeeded his father, Omar Bongo, who had ruled for 42 years.Over the years, the family has been accused of amassing wealth for themselves at the expense of the country - allegations they deny.Despite being an oil-rich nation, about a third of Gabon's population lives below the poverty line, according to the UN.",

    "body": "1 day agoKelly Ng,Singapore, Jonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Lulu Luo,Cabanatuan, PhilippinesAt least six people have died after a super typhoon barrelled through the Philippines, mere days after an earlier storm left more than 200 people dead.Super typhoon Fung-wong brought floods and landslides, which caused most of the deaths. It also cut power across entire provinces. It later weakened into a typhoon. More than 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead of it making landfall in the Philippines. It is now heading for Taiwan, where more than 3,000 people have been evacuated.Fung-wong was the 21st typhoon to hit the South East Asian nation this year, at a time where many residents are still struggling to recover from back-to-back natural disasters.Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, slammed into Aurora province on Luzon Sunday night with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h.The Philippines' meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.In Cabanatuan, one of the worst-hit cities, the BBC saw residents rushing into their homes to pull out furniture and pets on Monday, desperate to salvage as many of their possessions possible as water levels rose.Although its wind speeds did not come up to par with some of the strongest storms in the Philippines' history, Fung-wong dumped large amounts of rain on the country, leaving some 4,100 houses either totally destroyed or partially damaged.Cabanatuan resident Mercidita Adriano and her family had trimmed trees near their home last week to prepare for the storm.When the winds and rain intensified, ten of them crowded into a small room, praying throughout the day that the typhoon would spare their house, she told the BBC. Part of their roof was torn off by the heavy rain.Large parts of the country are still under water although the levels have gone down as of Tuesday morning. It comes just days after typhoon Kalmaegi ripped through the same region, leaving tens of thousands of people reeling. And in September, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the province of Cebu.While the Philippines is prone to natural disasters, this series of catastrophes is \"not routine\", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement on Sunday.\"It is a stark reminder of the escalating climate and seismic risks faced by vulnerable nations. Urgent support is needed to scale up relief efforts, prevent further loss of life and support the country as it recovers from this latest disaster,\" it said. ",

    "body": "14 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemAFPHamas wants its fighters in Rafah to be given safe passage, which has so far been rejected by Israel (file photo)US President Donald Trump's envoy and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, returned to Israel on Monday, as mediators face a new obstacle in their efforts to advance negotiations on the fragile Gaza ceasefire deal to the next and more complex phase.Key sticking points remain unresolved, including Hamas's disarmament, the reconstruction and future governance of Gaza, and the deployment of an international security force to the territory.Without a timeline for the discussions, which are likely to require significant concessions from both Israel and Hamas, there are doubts that any progress can be achieved.Another challenge has emerged recently, involving scores of Hamas fighters believed to be in tunnels beneath the southern city of Rafah behind the so-called \"Yellow Line\", which marks the area under Israeli control.Israel GPO via EPAJared Kushner (2nd L) and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2nd R) held talks in Jerusalem on MondayLast week, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said an amnesty could be offered for fighters who laid down their arms, and that this could be a \"model\" for what Washington hoped to apply in the rest of Gaza.Witkoff said 200 fighters were trapped, although this number has not been confirmed.According to media reports, Kushner and the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the issue during a meeting in Jerusalem on Monday.Hamas has previously said the fighters will not surrender and demanded that they are given safe passage, which has so far been rejected by Israel.An Israeli government spokeswoman said Netanyahu and Kushner had \"discussed phase one, which we are currently still in, to bring our remaining hostages, and the future of phase two of this plan, which includes the disarming of Hamas, demilitarising Gaza, and ensuring Hamas will have no role in the future of Gaza ever again\".The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Since then, more than 69,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.The first phase of the ceasefire, which came into force last month, focused on halting the war, returning all hostages, and securing a surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza.Twenty living hostages and the remains of 24 deceased captives have been released, with four bodies remaining in Gaza.In return, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners from its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza who were being held without charge or trial. It has also handed over the remains of 315 Palestinians from Gaza.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce, with Israel saying Hamas has deliberately delayed the return of the remains of hostages and Hamas saying that Israel has killed at least 240 Palestinians and is restricting the entry of aid supplies.Watch: BBC's Lucy Williamson taken to east of Gaza City in IDF-led visitHamas has previously rejected disarmament, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established. Israel refuses any involvement in the governance of Gaza by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which is the body that governs parts of the occupied West Bank. Countries are reluctant to commit troops to the multinational force without clear goals, concerned that their soldiers might end up confronting fighters from Hamas and other Palestinian factions.The Israeli military currently occupies 53% of Gaza's territory and is expected to withdraw further in the next stage of the plan.With no indication of imminent advances in the negotiations, a de-facto partition of Gaza between the area controlled by Israel and another ruled by Hamas was increasingly likely, sources told the Reuters news agency, with talks about reconstruction apparently likely to be limited to the Israel-controlled territory.Arab countries have already expressed concerns that the current separation could become a permanent partition of Gaza.The Trump plan does not include a pathway to Palestinian statehood - a concept which Israel rejects.",

    "body": "'There was blood everywhere': Delhi residents recount horror of huge car explosion1 day agoVikas Pandey and Antriksha PathaniaBBC News, DelhiBBCMohammed Azghar says that his brother has been missing since the blastMonday evening was busy as usual near the Red Fort metro station in India's capital Delhi when the sound of a loud blast broke through the cacophony on the streets.An explosion in a car killed at least eight people and injured more than 20. It was so powerful that several vehicles nearby almost melted, and people could hear the blast from kilometres away.The police are still investigating what caused the blast but the fact that it happened in one of the most secure and busy areas of Delhi has shocked people.On one side is Chandni Chowk - a busy trading and clothing hub that is busier than usual at this time of the year due to the peak wedding season.And on the other side is the 17th Century Red Fort which attracts thousands of tourists every day.Sandwiched between the two is the road where the explosion took place. Within minutes, confusion and alarm spread from the scene to the rest of the city.Some readers may find the details below disturbingMohamed Hafiz, who lives less than 200m from the spot, said his house shook and he and others ran out thinking it was an earthquake.What he saw on the street terrified him: people were running in all directions, cars were on fire, and bodies lay on the road. Some locals were trying to help the injured.\"There was blood everywhere. People were in shock. The scene was too disturbing - I could even see body parts,\" he said.As local media broke the news, fear and panic swept through the city. Police declared a high alert, and neighbouring states quickly followed suit.ReutersA member from the forensic team investigates the area where the blast took placeAs we entered Delhi from the neighbouring suburb of Noida, we could see a long queue of vehicles at the border as policemen searched them one by one.Everyone - the people in the vehicles and the policemen - looked tense as they all appeared to be in disbelief that something like this had happened in their city for the first time in more than a decade.Beyond the crossing, most roads were deserted as we drove to Lok Nayak Hospital, where the injured had been taken. Outside, a large crowd had gathered behind police cordons. Confusion hung in the air as people searched for answers, and fellow journalists speculated about what might have caused the explosion.Onlookers were mystified and even scared. Rajesh Kumar, who works at a tea shop near the hospital, said he always believed the capital was the safest city in the country.He said that though the blast had shaken him, he still believed that the security forces would soon find out what caused it.\"My family in Uttar Pradesh [state] told me to leave, they panic easily. I am a little worried and shocked but I don't think Delhi has suddenly become unsafe,\" he said.Among the crowd were also several people who were looking for missing family members.One of them was Mohammed Azghar, whose brother was in the area where the blast took place.\"My brother has been missing since the explosion. We haven't had any contact with him,\" he said.\"We've searched around Red Fort, Chandni Chowk, everywhere but we can't find him.\"Mr Azghar said his brother used to drive an electric rickshaw. \"The police have confiscated the vehicle, which is fine, we don't mind that. But at least help us find my brother.\"I just want some news - good or bad.\"The injured were taken to Lok Nayak Hospital in DelhiAfter visiting the hospital, we drove to the site of the blast. It was jarring to see the roads empty here, as the area is usually teeming with people late into the night.There were only security personnel or journalists around. Officials had relaxed restrictions and journalists could go closer to the site.The scene there told the story of the blast. There were mangled remains of cars, rickshaws and tuk-tuks. Blood stains could still be seen on the road. Some of the vehicles were charred beyond recognition.Some locals had also gathered around. They looked visibly shaken and worried about their immediate future.Ram Singh, who drives a small vehicle to ferry goods from stockrooms to shops in the area, is worried about business being affected.\"I earn daily and I am worried how I might feed my family. I hope a sense of security soon returns. I hope the police will be able to restore trust fairly quickly,\" he said.\"And I hope this never happens in our city ever again. We are shaken but we should overcome this.\"",

    "body": "Ghana's Asante king has welcomed the return of 130 gold and bronze artefacts from the UK and South Africa some of which were looted during colonial times and others bought on the open market.The items included royal regalia, drums and ceremonial gold weights, dating back to the 1870s - and reveal the cultural role gold played in Asante society.Twenty-five of the pieces were donated by British art historian Hermione Waterfield and the rest by South African mining company AngloGold Ashanti.Handing over the pieces at a ceremony at the Manhyia Palace, in the city of Kumasi, officials from AngloGold Ashanti said the gesture was made as an act of cultural respect and reconciliation.There have been tensions in the central Ashanti region between AngloGold Ashanti and residents, who have accused the company of exploiting mineral resources without doing much to develop the area or create jobs.Asante King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II thanked AngloGold Ashanti for voluntarily returning artefacts legitimately acquired on open markets.It reflected \"goodwill and respect for the source and legacy of the Asante kingdom\", the monarch said.The reception took place on Sunday, according to a statement released after the event from the palace.Ms Waterfield was a pioneering figure and curator at Christie's auction house in London and took a special interest in African art, establishing a department that focused on tribal art in the 1970s.She has long been a supporter of West African art restitution.According to Manhyia Palace Museum director Ivor Agyeman-Duah, Ms Waterfield's gifts included a wooden drum looted during the 1900 siege of Kumasi by British colonial forces.British soldiers were involved in a series of conflicts in the late 19th Century in what were called the Anglo-Asante wars. The palace of the king, or Asantehene, was plundered twice.The call by African countries for the return of looted items has been met with some success in recent years - though some items are only on loan.Last year, 32 looted artefacts went on display at the Manhyia Palace Museum as part of a three-year loan agreement between two British museums - the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) and British Museum - and the Asante king.In 2022, Germany was the first country to return Benin bronzes to Nigeria in a bid to deal with its \"dark colonial history\".They were looted by British troops in 1897 from the West African kingdom of Benin, in modern-day Nigeria's Edo state - and many were auctioned off in London and are in collections all over the world.",

    "body": "4 days agoNick ThorpeBudapest, HungaryOn the surface, the Hungarian prime minister's trip was exactly what he went to Washington for: luxuriant praise and an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, gas and nuclear supplies.And all that just five months out from a difficult election.Look closer, however, and the picture is less clear cut. The US side struck a hard trade deal - and an expensive one for Hungary. And there's no progress on Viktor Orban's biggest headache: ending the war in neighbouring Ukraine, and with it the long shadow the conflict casts over Hungary.Let's look first at Orban's key win - an exemption from US sanctions, which a White House official told the BBC was time-limited to one year, although Péter Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign minister, said would be indefinite.The time span is interesting. Trump clearly wants to help his friend win the election in April. And the exemption even partially dovetails with the European Commission demand to all member states to end the import of Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuel by the end of 2027. What is missing, from an EU perspective, is any political commitment from Orban to meet that demand - a commitment made and fulfilled by the Czech government. And the EU is trying to tighten energy sanctions - to the fury of Hungary and Slovakia.Away from the media spotlight, the Hungarian energy company MOL has been upgrading two of its refineries - Százhalombatta in Hungary and the Slovnaft facility in Bratislava - to process Brent crude instead of the high-sulphur Urals crude which flows through Russian pipelines. On Friday, MOL said 80% of its oil needs could be imported through the Adria pipeline from Croatia, albeit with higher logistical costs and technical risks. So Orban's argument, which so impressed Trump, that Hungary, as a landlocked country, has no alternative to Russian oil may not strictly be true. Overall, Hungary and Slovakia have together paid Russia $13bn (£10bn) for its oil between its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the end of 2024. The one-year window granted by the US is nevertheless a valuable respite for Hungarian households this winter. Orban told pro-government reporters who travelled with him to Washington that otherwise utility bills \"could have gone up by up to three times in December\". Capping those bills by various means has been a central plank of his popularity in Hungary since 2013. Under the US exemption, Hungary can also continue to buy Russian gas through the Turkstream pipeline, which traverses the Balkans, and pay for it in hard currency ($185m in August alone) using a Bulgarian loophole. Orban has agreed to buy LNG from the US worth $600 million, according to Bloomberg.Another key part of the Washington deal is nuclear. Hungary agreed to buy US nuclear fuel rods for its Paks 1 nuclear power station (at a cost of $114m), in parallel to those bought from Russia's Rosatom and France's Framatome.Russian plans to finance and build the nuclear extension, called Paks 2, have been long delayed by technical and licensing issues. The US agreement to lift all nuclear sanctions on Hungary may help restart that project, but thorny problems remain. Hungary has also agreed to buy US technology to extend the short-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at Paks for between $100m and $200m.Perhaps the biggest part of the deal was a Hungarian commitment to buy up to 10 small modular nuclear reactors from the US, for somewhere between $10bn and $20bn. Hungary needs electricity to power the huge Chinese battery plants being built around the country. Smaller nuclear plants are less plagued by building delays, and are easier to licence.Finally, a currency swap deal - similar to a recent US-Argentina deal to prop up the peso - under which US and Hungarian central banks can exchange currency is being discussed.This would mean that in a future financial crisis in Hungary, the US central bank could feed dollars to Budapest, which boosts financial security in Hungary.So in summary, Hungary struck a deal to buy US gas, nuclear energy and unspecified weapons systems in exchange for a temporary waiver from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas. But it failed to get the re-introduction of the US-Hungary dual taxation system, abolished in 2022, which harms mutual trade. And it did not get a new date for a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest as part of efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Critics say energy dependence on Russia is being replaced by energy dependence on the US. The Orban government argues it is achieving greater diversity of supply.",

    "body": "Harshita was murdered a year ago - so why has her killer not been caught, family ask2 days agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondentFamily handoutHarshita Brella's body was discovered in the boot of a car in London on 14 November last yearOne year since Harshita Brella was strangled to death in the UK, there is a sense of disbelief in her family home in the Indian capital Delhi.\"Why has her killer not been caught yet? Neither the UK government nor the Indian government are doing anything,\" Harshita's mother Sudesh Kumari says, sobbing into her scarf. \"I want justice for my daughter. Only then will I find peace.\"Harshita's body was found in the boot of a car in Ilford, east London, on 14 November 2024, a day after her family contacted UK police to say they had not heard from her since 10 November.Police believe Harshita, 24, was murdered on that day in Corby, Northamptonshire,  by her husband Pankaj Lamba, who fled to India soon after the killing and is still on the run.The couple, both Indian nationals, had moved from Delhi to the UK, settling in Corby, earlier that year.Northamptonshire PoliceA CCTV picture of the murder suspect Pankaj LambaIn March this year, police in Northamptonshire charged him with murder. He also faces charges of rape, sexual assault and controlling or coercive behaviour.Harshita's sister Sonia Dabas is frustrated with the pace of investigations.\"We are very disappointed with the UK police. Maybe because we are not citizens of the UK, that's why they are not serious about this case. They are sending out a message that foreign nationals are not safe in the UK,\" she told the BBC.Roughly two months before Harshita was killed, on 3 September, she had filed a case of domestic abuse against her husband. He was arrested and later released on bail on condition that he did not harass, pester or intimidate Harshita. The Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) expired four weeks later, on 1 October.Sonia accuses Northamptonshire Police of being negligent in following up on the domestic abuse case. \"That's when Pankaj figured out that the UK police are not really serious about this case and he felt he could get away with murder,\" she says.Four officers of the Northamptonshire Police are being investigated over their handling of Harshita's domestic abuse report and their interaction with her, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).The IOPC told the BBC this week that their investigation was complete and had been shared with Northamptonshire Police. Northamptonshire Police say they have been given until mid-November to respond to the IOPC's findings.Northamptonshire Police said: \"This is an exceptionally complex case and with criminal proceedings now active in the UK, we are unable to go into detail about the investigation at this time. However, we can confirm that the Indian authorities have been made aware through the appropriate channels of the charging decision.\"The Indian government has told the BBC they are in touch with the UK government on the matter, but neither side answered clearly about whether an extradition notice for Pankaj Lamba had been forwarded to the Indian authorities.Ms Brella detailed the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband in a letterHarshita's family also told the BBC that they believe Pankaj Lamba is in India, being shielded by Indian police.\"He has relatives who are policemen. In March this year, he was seen on CCTV footage withdrawing money from a bank. Then how come he's not been found yet? This is all because of corruption,\" says Sonia. The family also says they have information that in the early months of this year, Pankaj was running a shop in Gurgaon, not far from where they live.\"They [the Delhi Police] are just killing time,\" Sonia says.The Delhi Police did not respond to Sonia's accusations. They told the BBC that they have acted on the basis of a dowry complaint filed by Harshita's parents against Mr Lamba and members of his family, including his parents and sister, who were arrested and are now out on bail. The Delhi Police also say they issued public notices earlier this year offering a reward for information about Mr Lamba, and the search for him is still under way.Harshita's mother Sudesh Kumari says she still cannot believe her daughter is gonePankaj Lamba's family home is in the village of Dharauli, about 40 miles (65km) north of Delhi, and not far from Gurgaon where Ms Brella's family believe he was sighted in March. His parents Sudesh and Darshan Lamba didn't want to be interviewed when the BBC visited. But they rejected all the charges against them and their son. They claim they have not had any contact with him since 10 November 2024 – the same day that Harshita's family last had contact with her.For Harshita's father, Satbir Singh Brella, the days are filled with visits to police stations and courts.\"My daughter was so straightforward, and kind hearted. A really terrible thing happened to her,\" he says.Her mother points to the shoes she's wearing. They're Harshita's and were among her possessions from the UK returned to her family by British officials who visited them in July.\"They are tight for me, but I feel close to her when I wear them,\" says Sudesh Kumari. \"Sometimes I feel she's still in the UK, I cannot believe she is gone.\"Additional reporting: Aakriti Thapar, Adnan Bhat, Sanjay Ganguly",

    "body": "4 hours agoAnbarasan EthirajanGlobal News ReporterItaly says seven of its citizens are missing in Nepal after trying to climb a Himalayan peak in the north-east of the country.Officials said the Italian team was at the base camp of Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft), in Dolakha district.Three other Italian climbers have been confirmed dead this week, including in an avalanche that struck close to Dolma Khang on Monday. A senior Italian diplomat from neighbouring India has arrived in Kathmandu to coordinate with the Nepalese authorities and search teams.Nepal has been hit by avalanches and ferocious storms in the past week, killing and injuring a number of climbers and their local guides.\"At this stage, the local authorities have confirmed the deaths of three Italian climbers,\" Rome's foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. \"There remains no news of seven other Italian nationals, including Marco Di Marcello and Markus Kircheler.\"The foreign ministry said both Mr Marcello and Mr Kircheler were in the Yalung Ri area, where Monday's avalanche struck. Italian Paolo Cocco was among seven climbers who were already confirmed to have died near the Yalung Ri base camp. On Tuesday, Mr Marcello's family told Italy's Ansa news agency that his satellite radio signal was continuing to update and appeared to be moving. A Nepali tourism official, Ram Krishna Lamichhane, told the BBC they had been in contact with rescue teams searching the base camp at Dolma Khang peak, which was hit by an avalanche.\"According to the information we have, five people, including three foreign climbers and two Nepali guides, are missing in the Dolma Khang base camp area,\" Mr Lamichhane said.There have been conflicting reports about the number of dead and missing climbers in the area in recent days, as well as their nationalities. Mr Lamichhane added that they were also coordinating with the trekking agency that had organised their expedition to Dolma Khang to find out more details on the missing.As well as Paolo Cocco, the bodies of two other Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale the Panbari peak in western Nepal have also been recovered. Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week.The group had been granted permission to climb the 6,887m peak, but were reported missing when they lost contact with the base camp following heavy snowfall on 28 October.The third member of the group, another Italian man, was rescued along with one sherpa.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains.Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas.",

    "body": "9 hours agoLaura Gozzi and Paul KirbyReutersThe suspect was detained by police after he set fire to his carA driver has rammed his car into pedestrians and cyclists on the holiday island of Oléron, off the west coast of France, injuring five people - including two who are in a critical condition.A local man, 35, deliberately drove into people and then set fire to the vehicle, authorities said. He was immobilised with a stun gun after resisting arrest.The man drove some distance between two villages on the island, mowing down several people, the mayor of Dolus d'Oléron, Thibault Brechkoff, said.He is now being held by police in Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron on suspicion of attempted murder.The incident took place around 08:45 (07:45 GMT) and lasted 35 minutes. Witnesses described seeing a series of incidents in several places on the island, including the villages of Dolus d'Oléron and Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron, which came to an end outside a bakery.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, who travelled to the scene, said an inquiry had been opened, which would determine facts including whether there were \"one or more\" gas cylinders in the suspect's vehicle. \"This individual is known to police for petty crimes. He is not known to intelligence services for radicalisation of any kind,\" Nuñez added. The public prosecutor for La Rochelle, Arnaud Laraize, earlier said the man had shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\") at the moment of his arrest. Nuñez said that a representative from the National Anti-Terrorist Prosecutor's Office was at the scene as an \"observer\" only. One of the badly injured victims is a 22-year-old woman who suffered multiple traumas. The other person to be seriously hurt is reported to be a 69-year-old cyclist. \"There will likely be several other people involved; that is, even if they weren't physically harmed, they witnessed the scene and are obviously very psychologically disturbed by these events,\" Nuñez said. Oléron, a popular holiday destination, is metropolitan France's second largest island after Corsica and connected to the mainland by a road bridge.",

    "body": "Hamas has handed over to the Red Cross a coffin containing what it says is the body of another deceased hostage, the Israeli military has said.The remains have been transferred to Israeli forces, who will take them to the National Centre of Foreign Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Israel, which started nearly a month ago, Hamas agreed to return all 20 living and 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages it was holding within 72 hours.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.If the latest remains are confirmed as those of a dead hostage, it will mean six others are still in Gaza – including Israelis and foreign nationals.All the remaining living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the Israeli hostages and those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.On Tuesday, the remains of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen, 19, were returned.Staff Sgt Chen was serving as a soldier in the IDF's 7th Brigade when Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023.The IDF said he was killed inside a tank during a battle in Kibbutz Nir Oz and that his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage by Hamas.The slow progress over the return of the hostages has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.Israel has allowed members of the Palestinian armed group and Red Cross staff to search for remains in areas still controlled by Israeli forces.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned there will be a 10% reduction in air travel capacity at 40 major airports in the US starting Friday morning, if the government shutdown continues.The decision was made because air traffic controllers have been reporting issues with fatigue, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  said at a briefing with Duffy on Wednesday.\"It is unusual, just as the shutdown is unusual, just as the fact that our controllers haven't been paid for a month is unusual,\" said FAA chief Bryan BedfordDuring the shutdown, now the longest in US history, controllers have had to keep working without pay, prompting some to call out sick or take side jobs.Watch: \"There will be frustration\" - Transport secretary outlines reduction in air trafficThe flight reductions will be gradual, starting at 4% of domestic flights on Friday, then rising to 5% on Saturday and 6% on Sunday, before hitting the full 10% next week, Reuters reported after the announcement, citing four unnamed sources. The names of the affected airports - all high-traffic locations - will be released on Thursday, the officials said.The cancellations could affect between 3,500 and 4,000 flights per day. \"We are seeing pressures build in a way that we don't feel - if we allow it to go unchecked - will allow us to continue to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world,\" Bedford said.Duffy said air travel is still safe, and the decision to cancel the flights was being made to maintain safety and efficiency. If the shutdown continues and adds more pressure to the system, additional restrictive measures may be required, Bedford said. A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines, the fourth-largest carrier in North America, said in a statement that the company is still evaluating how the flight restrictions will affect its services, and will let customers know as soon as possible. \"We continue to urge Congress to immediately resolve its impasse and restore the National Airspace System to its full capacity,\" the spokesperson added.Delta Airlines declined to comment. The BBC has also reached out to other major US airlines. Once government funds ran out on 1 October, most federal workers were sent home and told they would be paid once the government reopened. Those deemed essential, like controllers, though, had to keep doing their jobs without pay.Almost immediately after the shutdown started, airports began feeling the effects. Some had to ground flights for hours after air traffic controllers called out sick, while others relied on controllers from other airports.Nick Daniels, the president of the labor union representing more than 20,000 aviation workers, put the situation into stark terms on Wednesday. \"Air traffic controllers are texting 'I don't even have enough money to put gas in my car to come to work,'\" he told CNN.\"We base what we do day in and day out on predictability,\" he said. \"Right now there is no predictability.\"Duffy warned earlier this week that the flight cancellations may be coming, as half of the country's 30 major airports experience staff shortages. He previously said there's a risk that comes with air traffic controllers taking on additional jobs during the shutdown, and had threatened to fire controllers who do not come to work.\"They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheque and not put food on the table? Or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables?\" Duffy said on ABC on Sunday. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoWill GrantCentral America and Cuba correspondentMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. In the video, a man approaches her from behind and attempts to kiss her on the neck and place his hands on her body. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken. The offender has been arrested.\"My view is, if I don't file a complaint, what will happen to other Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what will happen to all women in our country?\" Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday.\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" she said. \"I have experienced it before, when I wasn't president, when I was a student.\"She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.\"A line must be drawn,\" she said.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman. Femicide is also a huge problem in Mexico, with a staggering 98% of gender-based murders estimated to go unpunished.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events. On occasion, that has presented security concerns for her team. However, she confirmed in her new conference she had no intention of changing her policy of interacting with her supporters.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels. Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.Since taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump.",

    "body": "18 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterA collection of diaries has won the prestigious Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction for the first time.How to End a Story: Collected Diaries by Helen Garner charts the Australian writer's life from the early stages of her career in bohemian Melbourne, to raising her daughter in the 1970s, and her experience of a disintegrating marriage in the 1990s.Garner's previous work includes 2014's The House of Grief, which told the story of Robert Farquharson on trial for the murder of his three sons.Famous fans include fellow writer David Nicholls, and singer Dua Lipa, who said: \"Helen Garner's work is a thrilling discovery. She's one of the most fascinating writers I have come across.\"Chair of judges, Robbie Millen, said How to End a Story was the judges' unanimous winner, praising it as \"a remarkable, addictive book\".\"Garner takes the diary form, mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday, to new heights,\" he continued. \"She is a brilliant observer and listener - every page has a surprising, sharp or amusing thought. Her collected diaries will surely be mentioned alongside The Diary of Virginia Woolf.\" In her review, the Observer's Rachel Cooke also referenced the revered Modernist author, describing Garner's collection as \"the greatest, richest journals by a writer since Virginia Woolf's\".This marks the first major UK-based prize win for the Australian, who has been belatedly receiving attention in the UK following the British publication of three of her books for the first time last year.The Baillie Gifford Prize rewards the best of non-fiction and is open to authors of any nationality. As the winner, Garner will receive £50,000, with the other shortlisted authors each receiving £5,000, bringing the total prize value to £75,000.The selection was made from over 350 books published between 1 November 2024 and 31 October 2025.The others who made the shortlist were:The Revolutionists: The Story of the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970s by Jason Burke, about a group of extremists including Carlos the Jackal and the Baader-Meinhof Gang.The Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief by Richard Holmes, a biography about the young Alfred Lord TennysonCaptives and Companions: A History of Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Islamic World by Justin Marozzi, it covers slavery in the Islamic world from the 7th Century to the present dayLone Wolf: Walking the Faultlines of Europe by Adam Weymouth, this book follows a young wolf's 1000-mile trek across the European AlpsElectric Spark by Frances Wilson, a biography of novelist Muriel Spark",

    "body": "Several contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation. At a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.Video of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online. The Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has condemned Mr Nawat's \"malicious\" behaviour, for which he has since apologised.The Miss Universe contestants, who are the winners of national pageants in their home countries, attended Tuesday's event in their sashes and gowns.Some can be heard shouting back at Mr Nawat in the video, after he raises his voice to reprimand Ms Bosch and repeatedly tells her to stop talking. As many of them stand to show support, Mr Nawat says: \"If anyone wants to continue the contest, sit down. If you step out, the rest of the girls continue.\"Despite this, the majority of the women in the video appear standing, with several heading towards the door.After leaving the event on Tuesday, Ms Bosch told the press the 60-year-old executive was \"not respectful\" and said he had called her \"dumb\". Mr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood. He is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying she had caused \"damage\".His conduct prompted a stern rebuke from the MUO, which has sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.In a video statement, MUO President Raul Rocha said Mr Nawat had \"forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\". He said the Thai official had \"humiliated, insulted and showed a lack of respect\" to Ms Bosch, and committed the \"serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenceless woman\".Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited \"as much as possible\" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking \"legal actions\" against him.\"I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,\" Mr Rocha said.Among those to walk out on Tuesday was reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. \"This is about women's rights,\" she said as she left the event. \"This is not how things should be handled. To trash another girl is beyond disrespectful... That's why I'm taking my coat and I'm walking out.\"Ms Bosch later said in an interview: \"I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard. It's here stronger than ever. I have a purpose. I have things to say.\"We're in the 21st century. I'm not a doll to be made up, styled and have my clothes changed,\" she added. \"I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I'm completely committed to that.\"Video of Mr Nawat has outraged fans of the pageant, with many heavily criticising his actions and praising Ms Bosch's response.In a social media video statement, Mr Nawat said: \"If anyone feels bad, uncomfortable, or affected, I apologise to everyone. I especially apologised to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.\"The Miss Universe competition has pressed on despite this controversy, with contestants taking part in a welcome event in Bangkok on Wednesday.The winner will be crowned the new Miss Universe on 21 November.",

    "body": "Trump U-turns to renominate billionaire for Nasa chief10 hours agoTiffany WertheimerReutersJared Isaacman is reportedly friends with Elon Musk and has spent millions of dollars on SpaceX missionsDonald Trump has renominated billionaire investor Jared Isaacman to run Nasa, five months after withdrawing his first nomination.The 42-year-old entrepreneur, who has ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, had looked set to lead the space agency when Trump abruptly pulled his nomination in late May, following what the president said was a \"thorough review of prior associations.\"While the White House did not specify what those associations were, it was during Trump's high-profile feud with Musk.Isaacman, who is worth an estimated $1.9bn (£1.46bn), is an amateur jet pilot and also became the first non-professional astronaut to walk in space last year, on a mission with SpaceX that he bankrolled.Why Trump has suddenly changed his mind is unclear, and the president made no mention of the past when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he was \"pleased to nominate\" Isaacman for the role.\"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" the president wrote.The Nasa administrator role will be Isaacman's first job in politics, representing a departure from the last two men appointed to the job.It requires confirmation by the Senate, where the Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority. Even though the US government has been shut down since early October, the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees.Thanking the president, Isaacman wrote on X that \"it will be an honor\" to serve in the role.\"The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming,\" he wrote in a long post, that also acknowledged Nasa scientists and innovators. \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"Sean Duffy, the head of the transport department, has been interim Nasa chief since July.Isaacman's initial nomination withdrawal came just days after Elon Musk left the Trump administration, following a tumultuous drive to shrink the size of government departments with his Doge initiative, leading to thousands of job cuts.Concerns were voiced over Isaacman's ties to Musk and his SpaceX company, where Isaacman has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars. He has also made donations to the Democrats in past elections.His nomination has encountered scepticism, and at his initial confirmation hearing in April, members of both parties questioned Isaacman about possible conflicts of interest, budget cuts and his desire to send astronauts to Mars.They expressed fears he would sacrifice the long-planned Moon mission to focus on Mars, but Isaacman said both can be possible.\"We don't have to make a binary decision of Moon versus Mars, or Moon has to come first versus Mars,\" he later added.The billionaire - who was a high-school dropout - made his fortune from payment processing company Shift4 Payments, which he founded in 1999 in his parents' basement when he was 16.Isaacman has a longstanding interest in flying - having first taken pilot lessons in 2004 and later setting a world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the world in a light jet.More on this story",

    "body": "6 hours agoAndrew HardingParis correspondentReutersFrench police have launched an investigation into sex-trafficking linked to the disgraced businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who died two years ago.The police investigation, ordered by the Paris prosecutor's office, will focus on \"potential acts of aggravated human trafficking… with multiple victims,\" according to correspondence seen by the BBC. Prostitution and one case of rape are also being investigated.Al Fayed's Ritz Hotel in Paris will likely be a target of the investigation, amid claims from victims that staff knew about or facilitated the abuse of women.In a statement, the Ritz said it was \"deeply alarmed\" by the allegations of abuse and it would cooperate \"fully\" with authorities.The trafficking investigation marks a new twist in a series of legal battles linked to Al Fayed's violent crimes and to the search – both before and since his death – for some sort of justice for his many victims.An American woman, Pelham Spong, 40, played a key role in triggering this investigation in France, where it is alleged that Al Fayed moved young female staff from the Ritz to his private house in Paris and to various yachts and family homes on the Mediterranean coast.Ms Spong was living in Paris in 2008 when she applied for a job working as a personal assistant for the Al Fayed family in Monaco. She was brought to London several times, subjected to an intrusive gynaecological examination, and then – she alleges - sexually assaulted by Al Fayed in his office on Park Lane.\"He told me the job entailed sleeping with him,\" Ms Spong said, adding that she declined the offer on the spot.\"I didn't realise I was a victim of sex trafficking until this past year when I… saw the scale and scope of the abuse and realised that it was a pattern and a system and a machine,\" she told the BBC in an interview in Paris.Pelham Spong was 23 years old when she first applied to work for Al Fayed's familyA few months ago, Ms Spong, now living back in the USA, came to Paris to report her experiences to the French police, hoping that it might persuade other women to come forward with evidence of their own abuse.\"It's a big step that the prosecutors decided to open an investigation. [Ms Spong] has a really good case because she kept a lot of materials. It will be very strong,\" her lawyer, Anne-Claire Le Jeune told the BBC.Ms Spong said it is \"so much easier to dismiss the actions of an evil man that's dead\". \"And you can't learn anything from that as a society. So how do you prevent this happening again? \"Well, first, you have to name what it... It's critical to call it what it is, trafficking, so that we can prevent it,\" she said.Ms Spong's lawyer, Anne-Claire Le Jeune, says her client has a \"very strong\" caseAl Fayed is also being investigated in the UK, where more than 140 people have reported him to the Met Police.The extent of Al Fayed's predatory behaviour was first brought to light by a BBC documentary and podcast, broadcast in September 2024.Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-Harrods employees who said Al Fayed sexually assaulted or raped them. Since then, dozens more women have come forward with similar experiences.After the broadcast, the Met revealed it had been approached by 21 women before Al Fayed's death, who accused him of sexual offences including rape, sexual assault and trafficking. Despite this, he was never charged with any offences.Ms Spong herself says she spoke to British police about Al Fayed in 2017 but was told he was too ill to be questioned.Earlier this year, the Met wrote to alleged victims apologising, saying it was \"truly sorry\" for the distress they have suffered because Al Fayed will never face justice. The force is currently investigating its handling of historical allegations against Al Fayed and looking into whether others could face charges for enabling his behaviour.Harrods has set aside more than £60m in its plan to compensate alleged victims of Al Fayed's abuse. In a statement announcing the scheme, Harrods said: \"While we cannot undo the past, we have been determined to do the right thing as an organisation, driven by the values we hold today, while ensuring that such behaviour can never be repeated in the future.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoMadeline HalpertNew York CityWatch: Joy precedes scrutiny, reports Nada Tawfik from inside Mamdani's victory partyZohran Mamdani, 34, has won New York City's race for mayor in a contest that rallied young voters and sparked debate about the future direction of the US Democratic Party.Ugandan-born Mamdani, a Democrat, beat former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, to become the youngest person in over a century to lead the largest city in the US.\"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" the self-described democratic socialist told the crowd during a victory speech.Democrats also won governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in California voters backed a proposition to redraw the congressional electoral map ahead of next year's midterm elections. Mamdani made affordability the central message of his campaign, pledging to expand social programmes paid for by new taxes on high earners and corporations.In New York, he was a relatively unknown member of the state assembly until his campaign gained online momentum a few months ago, propelling him to victory in the Democratic primary contest over the summer.Mamdani has become the first South Asian and Muslim to lead the city. In his victory speech, he spoke of a \"new age\".\"For as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well-connected that power does not belong in their hands,\" Mamdani said. \"The future is in our hands,\" he said, pledging to create a government that works \"for everyone\".Mamdani's campaign has drawn significant national attention, including from US President Donald Trump, who in the days before the vote threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani won. The president calls Mamdani a communist - a label that Mamdani rejects.In overnight projections from BBC news partner CBS, Mamdani had secured 50.3% of the vote, compared with Cuomo's 41.6%. Republican Curtis Sliwa had just over 7%. Shortly after the winner was projected, Sliwa conceded.\"We have a mayor-elect,\" Sliwa told a group of supporters. \"Obviously I wish him good luck, because if he does well, we do well.\"Cuomo also conceded, congratulating Mamdani despite a chorus of boos from his supporters. But Cuomo highlighted that almost half of New Yorkers who voted had not picked Mamdani, and said his opponent had made \"promises that cannot be met\".There are questions over how Mamdani will pay for his ambitious social agenda and critics have questioned how a politician with no executive experience will handle a hostile Trump administration.On Tuesday night, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson criticised the \"consequences\" of New York City's choice on social media platform X. \"Zohran Mamdani's election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party,\" he wrote.The president also posted on social media, blaming the shutdown, and his not appearing on the ballot, for Republican losses Tuesday night. Wins for other Jay Jones and other DemocratsCentrist Democrats clinched victories in elections for governor on Tuesday night, with Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill winning races to run the states of Virginia and New Jersey respectively.The races were being viewed as an indication of how Americans were feeling about the national government's policies, although the latter state is reliably blue.In another closely watched contest in Virginia, Democratic candidate Jay Jones won the race for state attorney general, defeating incumbent Republican candidate Jason Miyares. That was despite a scandal over his historical text messages that wished violence against a political rival, for which Jones apologised.Voters in California also approved a measure to redraw political lines to favour Democrats, in response to similar efforts by conservative-led states in a nationwide battle for control of the US House of Representatives.The redistricting measure, called Prop 50, was aimed at reconfiguring the state's voting districts to give Democrats better chances at taking five seats in the US House of Representatives from Republicans during next year's midterm elections.Whether the measure will tip the balance of power in Washington remains unclear.Questions for national Democratic PartyMamdani's win in New York presents a dilemma for the Democratic establishment, which has been reluctant to endorse him. Mamdani was nonetheless favoured to win his race, having led his rivals in the polls by double digits for weeks leading up to election day. A relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his journey from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to the frontrunner candidate to lead a city with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.The former New York assemblyman centred his campaign on cost-of-living issues in one of the country's most expensive cities, campaigning on issues like universal child care, and free and faster buses. His candidacy drew criticism from business leaders and centrist Democrats, some of whom did not endorse him, including fellow New Yorker and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans have seized on Mamdani's popularity to paint the future of the Democratic Party as more and more left-leaning - a point that Trump has made during his threats to withhold federal funding to the New York City.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKelly NgSingaporeGetty ImagesNamewee, whose real name is Wee Meng Chee, is known for his satirical and profanity-laced musicControversial Malaysian rapper Namewee has been remanded in custody in connection with the death of a Taiwanese influencer found dead in a Kuala Lumpur hotel bathtub two weeks ago.Police say Namewee, 42, was the last person seen with 31-year-old Iris Hsieh, according to reports. She was in Malaysia to discuss a commercial video Namewee had agreed to direct, her social media manager told the BBC.Namewee, who denies charges of illegal drug use and possession for which he was granted bail, is now back in custody to \"assist in the investigation\", police said after reclassifying her death as murder.He turned himself in early on Wednesday, his lawyer said, and has been put on remand for six days.'I won't run away'The case has gone through many twists in the last few days.According to Malaysian media reports, Namewee contacted emergency services at 12:30 local time (05:30 GMT) on 22 October, after he found Hsieh unresponsive in the bathroom.Police arrested Namewee that same day, after they found nine blue pills believed to be ecstasy in the hotel room. Despite denying he had used drugs, Namewee tested positive for several illicit substances, including amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine, and THC, police said. On Monday, he pleaded not guilty to the drug charges and was released on bail.Namewee has maintained his innocence over the past few days and accused local media of \"chasing shadows\" with their reports on the case. The singer, known for his satirical and profanity-laced music, has 3.6m subscribers on YouTube and 856,000 followers on Instagram. Singing in Mandarin, he is hugely popular in Taiwan and China.Hsieh was previously featured in Namewee's music video for China Reggaeton, a song he released in January 2020.On Tuesday, Kuala Lumpur police chief Fadil Marsus told reporters Namewee had \"gone into hiding\" after Hsieh's case was reclassified from \"sudden death\" to murder.At the same time, Mr Fadil said police were waiting for post-mortem and toxicology results to determine the cause of death.In the early hours of Wednesday, Namewee posted a clip on Instagram saying he had arrived at the police station and would \"fully co-operate with the police to provide answers to the public and the bereaved family\".\"I won't run away,\" he added.Who is Namewee?Namewee, whose real name is Wee Meng Chee, has long courted controversy with his music.Often seen wearing a beanie and sunglasses, he first gained popularity - and notoriety - in 2007 with his controversial remake of Malaysia's national anthem, Negaraku, which mocked the government. The music video quickly went viral on YouTube and authorities considered charging him with sedition, but did not proceed after he made a public apology and removed the clip.In 2016, he was arrested for his music video Oh My God, which features him rapping in front of places of worship around Malaysia. Authorities said the song insulted Islam and jailed him for four days.His 2021 song Fragile poked fun at \"little pinks\" - young nationalists who rush to the defence of the Chinese government on the internet - and took digs at several sensitive issues, from Xinjiang to Taiwan sovereignty. That track went viral among Mandarin-speaking audiences, but was banned by China. Speaking to the BBC in 2021, Namewee said he saw the ban as \"part of my creative work\".\"Some people think that my work is controversial, or that I have always been crossing the red line,\" he said at the time. \"Sometimes I intend to do so... If I think more people should know about certain issues, I want more people to care.\"Namewee has collaborated with other popular Mandarin artists, including Taiwanese rock duo Power Station and Chinese-Australian singer Kimberly Chen, and has been nominated three times for the best Mandarin male singer in Taiwan's Golden Melody Awards.He has also ventured into filmmaking, both starring in and directing films, some of which have stirred controversy over their portrayals of race and religion.Who is Iris Hsieh?Compared to Namewee, Hsieh was not as famous across Asia, although she had a fairly strong following on social media and was known for posting photos of herself in revealing outfits.Nicknamed the \"nurse goddess\" by her fans, she graduated from the Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology with a degree in nursing, according to China Press, a Mandarin newspaper published in Malaysia. Hsieh rose to internet fame around 2019, Malaysian media reported, and released a personal photo album titled Angel Heart the next year.She has about 545,000 followers on Instagram - her fifth account on the social media platform, after the last four were suspended for \"adult sexual solicitation\", CNA reported.She was also active on OnlyFans, where she started an account in 2022.Hsieh's social media manager, who asked only to be referred to as Chris, told the BBC that her family were unable to go to Malaysia to follow up on the case because of their \"severe disabilities\".They have instead hired legal representatives there to act on their behalf, he said.",

    "body": "7 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East correspondent, GazaWatch: BBC's Lucy Williamson taken to east of Gaza City in IDF-led visitFrom an embankment overlooking Gaza City, there's no hiding what this war has done.The Gaza of maps and memories is gone, replaced by a monochrome landscape of rubble stretching flat and still for 180 degrees, from Beit Hanoun on one side to Gaza City on the other.Beyond the distant shapes of buildings still standing inside Gaza City, there's almost nothing left to orient you here, or identify the neighbourhoods that once held tens of thousands of people.This was one of the first areas Israeli ground troops entered in the early weeks of the war. Since then they have been back multiple times, as Hamas regrouped around its strongholds in the area.Israel does not allow news organisations to report independently from Gaza. Today it took a group of journalists, including the BBC, into the area of the Strip occupied by Israeli forces. The brief visit was highly controlled and offered no access to Palestinians, or other areas of Gaza.Military censorship laws in Israel mean that military personnel were shown our material before publication. The BBC maintained editorial control of this report at all times.The remains of Shejaiya, an eastern neighbourhood of Gaza CityAsked about the level of destruction in the area we visited, Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said it was \"not a goal\".\"The goal is to combat terrorists. Almost every house had a tunnel shaft or was booby-trapped or had an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] or sniper station,\" he said. \"If you're driving fast, within a minute you can be inside of a living room of an Israeli grandmother or child. That's what happened on October 7.\"More than 1,100 people were killed in the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, and 251 others taken hostage.Since then, more than 68,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry there.The bodies of several hostages had been found in this area, Lt Col Shoshani said, including that of Itay Chen, returned to Israel by Hamas this week. Searches are continuing for the missing bodies of another seven hostages.The Israeli military base we travelled to is a few hundred metres from the yellow line – the temporary boundary set out in US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which divides the areas of Gaza still controlled by Israeli forces from the areas controlled by Hamas.Israel's army has been gradually marking out the yellow line with blocks on the ground, as a warning to both Hamas fighters and civilians. There are no demarcations along this part of the line yet - a soldier points it out to me, taking bearings from a small patch of sand between the grey crumbs of demolished buildings.EPAHamas fighters pictured on Wednesday in Gaza City (image brightened for clarity)The ceasefire is almost a month old, but Israeli forces say they are still fighting Hamas gunmen along the yellow line \"almost every day\". The piles of bronze-coloured bullet casings mark the firing points on the embankments facing Gaza City.Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire \"hundreds of times\", and Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry says more than 240 people have been killed as a result.Col Shoshani said that Israeli forces were committed to the US-led peace plan, but that they would also make sure that Hamas no longer posed a threat to Israeli civilians, and would stay as long as necessary.\"It's very clear to everyone that Hamas is armed and trying to control Gaza,\" he said. \"This is something that will be worked out, but we're far from that.\"Moose Campbell/ BBCBuildings in Gaza City have been reduced to grey, dusty rubble (image brightened for clarity)The next stage of the US-led plan requires Hamas to disarm and hand over power to a Palestinian committee overseen by international figures including President Trump.But rather than give up its power and weapons, Col Shoshani said, Hamas was doing the opposite.\"Hamas is trying to arm itself, trying to assert dominance, assert control over Gaza,\" he told me. \"It's killing people in broad daylight, to terrorise civilians and make sure they understand who is boss in Gaza. We hope this agreement is enough pressure to make sure Hamas disarms.\"Israeli forces showed us a map of the tunnels they said that soldiers had found beneath the rubble we saw – \"a vast network of tunnels, almost like spider's web\" they said – some already destroyed, some still intact, and some they were still searching for.What happens in the next stage of this peace deal is unclear.The agreement has left Gaza in a tense limbo. Washington knows how fragile the situation is - the ceasefire has faltered twice already.The US is pushing hard to move on from this volatile stand-off to a more durable peace. It has sent a draft resolution to UN Security Council members, seen by the BBC, which outlines a two-year mandate for an international stabilisation force to take over Gaza's security and disarm Hamas.But details of this next stage of the deal are thin: it's not clear which countries would send troops to secure Gaza ahead of Hamas disarmament, when Israel's troops will withdraw, or how the members of Gaza's new technocratic administration will be appointed.President Trump has outlined his vision of Gaza as a futuristic Middle Eastern hub, built with foreign investment. It's a far cry from where Gaza is today.Largely destroyed by Israel, and seen as an investment by Trump, the question is not just who can stop the fighting, but how much say Gazans will have in the future of their communities and lands.More on the Israel-Gaza war",

    "body": "<div><p>At least 24 people were killed and 47 others wounded while protesting Myanmar's military government after a motorised paraglider dropped two bombs on the crowd, a spokesperson for the government-in-exile has told BBC Burmese.</p><p>The military attacked on Monday evening as around 100 people gathered in Chaung U township in central Myanmar for a national holiday.</p><p>Thousands have died and millions have been displaced since 2021, when the army seized power, triggering a civil war with armed resistance groups and ethnic militias.</p><p>After losing control of more than half the country, the army is now making significant gains again, through an especially bloody campaign of airstrikes and heavy bombardment.</p></div><div><p>The township that was attacked on Monday is in the Sagaing region, which has been a key battleground in the war. Large parts of it are under the control of volunteer militias established after the coup to fight the military governmet, or junta. </p><p>These groups, known as the People's Defence Force (PDF), also run the local administration. An official in the local PDF told BBC Burmese that they had received information about a potential airborne attack during Monday's gathering.</p><p>They tried to end the protest quickly, but the paramotors reached the scene earlier than expected, he said.</p><p>It all happened in seven minutes, he said. He says the explosion injured his leg, but some people near him were killed. </p><p>Locals told BBC Burmese that it was hard to identify the bodies in the aftermath.</p><p>\"Children were completely torn apart,\" another woman who had helped to organise the event told AFP news agency. She was not at the scene but attended funerals on Tuesday, and added that they were still \"collecting body parts\".</p><p>In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International said that the junta's use of motorised paragliders to attack communities was part of a \"disturbing trend\". </p><p>BBC Burmese recently reported that the junta were increasingly opting for paramotors amid a lack of aircraft and helicopters. </p><p>International sanctions over the past few years have made it harder for Myanmar's miliatry rulers to procure military equipment.</p><p>However, advanced drones and military technology supplied by China and Russia have given the junta a new edge on the battlefield, according to analysts.</p><p>Joe Freeman, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher, said the attack \"should serve as a gruesome wake-up call that civilians in Myanmar need urgent protection\".</p><p>He also called on Asean, the South East Asian regional bloc due to convene later this month, to \"increase pressure on the junta and revise an approach that has failed the Myanmar people for almost five years\".</p><p>Monday's candlelight vigil had been organised as a peaceful protest against the junta's military conscription and the upcoming national election. They were also  calling for the release of  political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically elected leader who was deposed in the coup and jailed. </p><p>Myanmar is slated to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3pp4n952o\">hold general elections in December</a>, the first vote since the 2021 coup. Critics, however, say the election will not be free and fair, allowing the military to continue wielding unchecked power in the country.</p></div>",

Futures are agreements to buy or sell the asset at a pre-determined date in the future.</p><p>The US government shutdown, which was triggered by repeated impasses over public spending, is a \"tailwind for gold prices\", said OCBC's Christopher Wong, who is the Singapore-based bank's rates strategist.</p><p>Investors have turned to safe haven assets like gold during previous US government shutdowns.</p><p>It rose by nearly 4% during the month-long shutdown in Trump's first term in the White House.</p><p>But gold prices could fall if the shutdown ends more quickly than some investors are expecting, said Mr Wong.</p><p>Gold's \"unprecedented rally\" in the past month has surpassed analysts' expectations, said UOB bank's head of markets strategy Heng Koon How.</p><p>He added that the rise is also tied to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn1egyn4xo\">weakening US dollar</a> and more non-professional buyers, known as retail investors, purchasing gold.</p><p>Not everyone investing in gold buys the physical precious metal.</p><p>Some investors put their money into financial products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are backed by gold.</p><p>A record $64bn has been invested in gold ETFs so far this year, according to the World Gold Council trade association.</p></div><div><p>Gregor Gregerson, the founder of precious metals dealer and storage provider Silver Bullion, said he has seen customers numbers more than double in the last year.</p><p>Retail investors, banks and wealthy families have increasingly turned to gold, viewing it as a safeguard against global economic uncertainty, he said.</p><p>\"Most of our clients are long-term holders,\" Mr Gregersen added, explaining that the majority of his customers store their gold for more than four years.</p><p>\"Gold will fall at some point, but I believe given the economic environment, it's on an upward trend for a least five years,\" he said.</p><p>As Mr Gregersen highlighted, gold prices fall as well as rise.</p><p>Its price may dip if there is a hike in interest rates or geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties ease, said OCBC's Mr Wong.</p><p>In April, for instance, the price of gold fell by around 6% after Trump backed off from firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said.</p><p>\"Gold is often seen as a hedge against uncertainty, but the hedge can be unwound.\"</p><p>And in 2022, gold's<b> </b>value plunged from $2,000 to $1,600 an ounce, after the US central bank raised interest rates to curb the inflation which was triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, said UOB's Mr<b> </b>Heng.</p><p>A key risk to gold's current rally is a sudden resurgence in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates, he added.</p><p>The recent climb in gold prices reflects expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates, making gold more attractive, said Mr Wong.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump has ramped up pressure on the Fed, publicly criticising Mr Powell for not cutting rates quick enough and attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.</p><p>The president's targeting of the Fed can \"undermine confidence in the [its] ability to act as a credible, inflation-targeting central bank,\" said Mr Wong.</p><p>In such an environment, gold's role as a hedge against uncertainty \"gains renewed importance,\" he said.</p></div>",

Its figures are seen as reliable by the UN and other international bodies.</p><p>The ministry has said another 460 people have died from the effects of malnutrition since the start of the war, including 182 since a famine was confirmed in Gaza City in August by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).</p><p>The UN-backed body said more than half a million people across Gaza were facing \"catastrophic\" conditions characterised by \"starvation, destitution and death\". </p><p>Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza.</p><p>A UN commission of inquiry said last month that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, in a report Israel's foreign ministry categorically rejected as \"distorted and false\". </p></div>",

In 2023, after serving six years as president, he was made a member of the board of directors, the governing body of the organisation.</p><p>On its website, African Parks lists a number of high-profile donors including the European Union, Rob Walton, heir to the Walmart fortune, and Howard Buffett, son of Warren Buffet.</p><p>In its 2023 annual report, the charity said its funders provided it with more than $500,000 (£375,000) per year.</p><p>The Chadian government's decision is a new blow to Harry's charitable endeavours after he stepped down earlier this year from Sentebale, an organisation he founded to help children orphaned by Aids in Botswana and Lesotho.</p><p>His resignation as patron of the charity followed a highly publicised <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c741n548dkko\">boardroom battle with chairwoman Dr Sophie Chandauka</a>.</p></div>",

Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are currently locked in a standoff, each putting forward resolutions for reopening the government that have failed in multiple rounds of voting. Democrats want any resolution to address health care, while Republicans want \"clean\" legislation that only deals with the federal budget.</p><p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told a news conference on Tuesday that he had not yet spoken to the White House about back pay, but new legal analysis was challenging the requirement to retroactively pay furloughed employees.</p><p>\"It's true that in previous shutdowns, many or most of them have been paid for the time they were furloughed,\" he said. \"There are some legal analysts who are saying that may not be appropriate or necessary.\"</p><p>If that analysis turned out to be valid, he added, then it would put pressure on Democrats to join Republicans and pass their resolution to reopen the government.</p><p>Congressional records show Johnson <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/201928\">voted </a>for the 2019 law.</p><p>The OMB memo was roundly criticised by Democratic lawmakers.</p><p>\"This is totally illegal,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said.</p><p>He called the memo \"another illegitimate attempt\" by OMB Director Russ Vought to \"traumatize\" federal workers, \"which seems to be what gets him out of bed in the morning\".</p><p>Some Republicans also seemed to sceptical of Trump's approach.</p><p>South Dakota's John Thune, the top Republican in the Senate said he expected furloughed workers to be paid.</p><p>Another Republican, North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, said it was a \"strategic mistake\" to let furloughed workers \"know, or let them think, that they could potentially not get back pay\".</p><p> \"I don't think that that is a helpful discussion right now,\" he said.</p></div>",

For the third time in a year his choice of prime minister has resigned, and opinion polls suggest almost three-quarters of voters think the president should step down too.</p><p>Long-time ally Édouard Philippe, who served as Macron's first prime minister from 2017 to 2020, has urged him to appoint a technocrat prime minister and call presidential elections in an \"orderly manner\".</p><p>But Macron is more likely to dissolve parliament than step down.</p></div><p></p><h2>How did we get here?</h2><p></p><div><p>Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu announced his resignation at the start of a day of political drama on Monday, after only 26 days in the job.</p><p>Hours later he said he had accepted Macron's request to stay on for another 48 hours to hold last-ditch talks with political parties \"for the stability of the country\".</p><p>The unexpected twists were the latest in a long series of upheavals that began with Emmanuel Macron's decision to call a snap parliamentary election in June 2024. The result was a hung parliament in which Macron's centrist partners lost their majority and had to seek alliances with other parties.</p><p>The leader of one of those parties, Bruno Retailleau of the conservative Republicans, pulled out of Lecornu's government 14 hours after it was announced.</p></div><p></p><h2>It's all about France's debt</h2><p></p><div><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt and get over the ideological divisions between the centre-ground parties who could be part of a government.</p><p>Early this year public debt stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy. France's budget deficit this year is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.</p><p>Michel Barnier and François Bayrou lasted only three and nine months respectively before being ousted in confidence votes as they tried to tackle the deficit with austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu did not even make it as far as presenting a budget plan. Criticism poured in from all sides as soon as he presented his cabinet on Sunday afternoon and by Monday morning he had decided his position was untenable.</p><p>He blamed his departure on the unmovable stance of parties who, he said, \"all behave as if they had a majority\".</p><p>All the parties have an eye on the next presidential votes in 2027, and they are also gearing up for the possibility of snap parliamentary elections in case Macron dissolves parliament again.</p></div><p></p><h2>Who are the key figures in this crisis?</h2><p></p><div><p>The leaders who have been calling on Macron to resign for months are on the hard right and radical left.</p><p>Marine Le Pen and her young lieutenant in the far-right National Rally, Jordan Bardella, are ready for elections and have refused Lecornu's invitation to talk.</p><p>Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) has been agitating for Macron's impeachment, although that seems unlikely. He is backed by the Greens.</p><p>Olivier Faure's centre-left Socialists were allied to the radical left during the last elections but have been talking to Lecornu on condition that he forms a left-wing government.</p><p>Then there is Gabriel Attal, who leads Macron's own centrist Renaissance party, but has said he no longer understands the president's decisions.</p><p>And on the centre-right is Bruno Retailleau, whose Republicans have been part of the so-called <i>socle commun</i> (common platform) with the centrists.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef6a/live/3ced0920-a394-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A smiling Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella walk down the street\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>A snap election would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular</figcaption><p></p></figure><p></p><h2>What happens now?</h2><p></p><div><p>Lecornu has been deep in discussions with party representatives and has until Wednesday evening to present a \"platform of action and stability\" to Macron.</p><p>There are four options - and none of them look good.</p></div><div><ul><li>If Lecornu manages to persuade the centre-ground parties to form some kind of government, then Macron will be able to name a new prime minister, whoever that is. Lecornu has indicated he does not wish to take on the job, although that is not a definitive no. The omens are not great. When he resigned on Monday Lecornu said: \"I was ready for compromise but all parties wanted the other party to adopt their programmes in their entirety.\" But France does need to pass some kind of 2026 budget to tackle its national debt, and the factions know that.</li><li>If Lecornu fails, the Elysee has indicated that Macron would \"take responsibility\". That would probably mean fresh parliamentary elections, which would spell bad news for his centrist allies and the Socialists but would benefit Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally in particular. Elections would need to take place a maximum of 40 days after parliament is dissolved - which would mean voting in November.</li><li>Macron's presidency ends in 18 months but he is facing increasing calls to step down. He has repeatedly rejected early presidential elections, but it is not out of the question. Former Macron minister Benjamin Haddad argues that his resignation would make no sense  as the next president would just face the same problem: \"The political divide is here to stay.\"</li><li>Even without a government agreement, the parties could put aside their differences in parliament and come to a compromise on a limited budget. But French politics is not known for its culture of compromise.</li></ul></div><p></p><h2>Has Macron run out of road?</h2><p></p><div><p>After his third prime minister in the past year announced his resignation on Monday, Macron went for a long walk along the River Seine, his mobile phone to his ear.</p><p>A stunt for the cameras? Perhaps, but it was symbolic of the solitary nature of his position, as he confronts some of the hardest choices of his presidency and some of his former allies appear to be deserting him.</p><p>But the president will have known for some time of the political challenges ahead and he is not one to give up without a fight -<b> </b>or another bid to stabilise an increasingly ungovernable France. There is a sense that time may be running out for the master of the clocks.</p></div></article>",

It lived up to that billing.</p><p>The attorney general was making her first appearance at a congressional oversight hearing - and it was a timely one.</p><p>Two weeks ago, her justice department <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33r872egvjo\">indicted former FBI Director James Comey</a>, triggering an outcry from Democratic politicians.</p><p>Her testimony on Tuesday also came just a day after a group of former justice department employees released a letter accusing Bondi of helping to take a \"sledgehammer\" to \"longstanding work the department has done to protect communities and the rule of law\".</p><p>Nerves were raw, and Bondi was clearly ready for a fight. Here are five takeaways from the hearing.</p></div><p></p><h2>1. Bondi goes on the attack</h2><p></p><div><p>Recent Trump administration officials, including Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and FBI Director Kash Patel, have relied on a clear playbook for testimony before hostile congressional committees. </p><p>Go on the attack early and often.</p><p>That strategy was on display throughout Bondi's testimony. When pressed on National Guard deployments, she said she wished Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and California Senator Alex Padilla loved their states \"as much as they hate Donald Trump\".</p><p>When questioned about Jeffrey Epstein, she noted that several Democratic senators had taken money from deep-pocketed donors who had ties to the late convicted sex trafficker.</p><p>Bondi launched a series of pointed attacks on senators as they questioned her.</p><p>And when it was time for junior Vermont Senator Peter Welch to ask questions, he began by observing Bondi's penchant for launching personal attacks.</p><p>\"I'll be waiting for my turn,\" the soft-spoken New Englander said, quipping about the expected onslaught. \"But you don't have to do it now\".</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump says “there will be others” after Comey indictment</figcaption><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Lots of questions, few answers</h2><p></p><div><p>When Bondi wasn't going on the attack, she frequently declined to comment on questions from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>She said she wouldn't discuss \"personnel matters\" when questioned about the spate of senior level justice department firings, including top FBI officials and a US lawyer who had recommended against the Comey indictment.</p><p>She wouldn't comment on \"ongoing investigations\" and legal proceedings – including the Comey case. She also wouldn't shed light on conversations she has had with the president or other White House aides.</p><p>When presented with a large photograph of her sitting at a table with the president the day after Trump had penned a Truth Social post calling for her to indict Comey, her only remark was that she loved the picture.</p><p>\"This is supposed to be an oversight hearing where members of Congress can get serious answers to serious questions,\" California Senator Adam Schiff said, after listing all the questions that Bondi had refused to answer.</p><p>\"I think you owe the president an apology for your entire career,\" Bondi replied.</p></div><p></p><h2>3. Bondi keen to focus on crime</h2><p></p><div><p>Bondi appeared determined to focus on what she said was the Trump administration's goal of reducing crime in the US.</p><p>She was quick to cite statistics that she said showed the successes they have had so far – the number of arrests in Washington DC, the drug crackdowns and illegal firearm confiscations in Chicago, the drug seizures at the border.</p><p>\"We are returning to our core mission of fighting real crime,\" Bondi said.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33r872egvjo\">Trump urged prosecutors to target Comey. Now he's been charged</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wgg4vgeedo\">Trump pushes justice department to prosecute his political opponents</a></li></ul><p>Democrats may have had other ideas, but Bondi - and the White House - likely feel they are on the safest political ground when they talk about crime-fighting. </p><p>It is an issue that, according to the polls, many Americans care about – and one that has the potential to appeal not just to die-hard conservative partisans, but to independent and Democratic voters as well.</p></div><p></p><h2>4. But Democrats focus on Epstein</h2><p></p><div><p>A source of particular heat for Bondi over the past few months has been the justice department's handling of its investigation into Epstein, who before his death had well documented ties to many rich and powerful Americans.</p><p>For most of the hearing, Democrats were the ones peppering Bondi with Epstein-related questions.</p><p>Senator Sheldon Whitehouse wanted to know if the FBI had discovered pictures of Trump and \"half-naked young women\", and whether the justice department had looked into \"suspicious activity reports\" about Epstein's finances. </p><p>Bondi wouldn't answer.</p><p>Dick Durbin asked about claims that the justice department had flagged anything in its Epstein documents related to Trump to the president.</p><p>\"I'm not going to discuss anything about that with you, senator,\" Bondi replied.</p><p>The attorney general was asked why her department now says there is no list of Epstein's clients after she earlier claimed to have that information on her desk.</p><p>Bondi responded by citing the department's previous finding that there was no evidence of conspiracy or a cover-up surrounding the investigation.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9e25/live/83d8c6d0-a3b7-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, speaks as he attends an oversight hearing of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Capitol Hill in Washington\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The hearing was testy - with both parties attacking the other in their questioning</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>The questions still swirling around the Epstein investigation have been a rare source of bipartisan interest, with some Republicans joining Democrats to call for more transparency. It took a while, but this Senate hearing finally gave some indication of that.</p><p>Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana recounted recent comments by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that Epstein was \"the greatest blackmailer ever\".</p><p>The Louisiana senator suggested Lutnick, who owned a home near Epstein in Palm Beach Florida, should testify before Congress and speak to the FBI.</p><p>Bondi continued her Epstein dance, saying it was up to Lutnick and FBI Director Kash Patel to decide if a meeting was necessary.</p></div><p></p><h2>5. Republicans look back in anger</h2><p></p><div><p>If Democrats were focused on what they view as the unprecedented weaponisation of the justice department under Trump, most of the Republican senators were more interested in fighting battles from the Biden presidency – or earlier.</p><p>Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley spent much of the hearings interjecting on how Democrats had, in his view, stonewalled investigations into the Biden family's business dealings.</p><p>South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham condemned the FBI's Russia investigation following the 2016 presidential election. Ted Cruz of Texas focused on protests outside the homes of conservative Supreme Court justices in the wake of their 2021 decision overturning abortion rights. </p><p>Eric Schmidt of Missouri filled out a veritable bingo card of right-wing complaints directed at the justice department.</p><p>Bondi, for her part, wholeheartedly agreed with the Republican chorus.</p><p>When the five-hour hearing finally concluded, the event had the feeling of a partisan house of mirrors, with each side accusing the other of political weaponisation and partisan prosecutions.</p><p>\"The Department of Justice is supposed to be the nation's guardian of fairness and the rule of law,\" Senator Alex Padilla said during his questioning. \"When the public trust breaks down, then justice itself is at risk.\"</p><p>It is the kind of comment that both Republicans and Democrats on the committee could agree with – before casting the other side as the source of the nation's ills.</p></div></article>",

Hundreds of local villagers and rescue workers have been deployed to clear out snow blocking access to the area, which sits at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). </p><p>Rescuers have guided 350 people to safety in the small township of Qudang. Authorities are in contact with all the hikers who are still trapped.</p></div><div><p>Nature photographer Dong Shuchang was among hundreds of tourists who flocked to the area during China's Golden Week holiday. </p><p>He was looking forward to capturing the Himalayan marvel from the Tibetan slopes, when the snowstorm hit just hours after his trek started on Saturday.</p><p>\"The lightning and thunderstorms would not stop. The snowfall was so heavy I could hardly sleep,\" Mr Dong explained.</p><p>His group had reached an altitude of 4,600m before they decided to turn back.  </p><p>\"Our windbreakers and raincoats were no match for the snow. We were all drenched,\" he said, adding that several people in his group of 20 showed signs of hypothermia.</p><p>The 27-year-old had been to the Himalayas more than a dozen times, but said he has \"never experienced weather like this\". </p><p>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet.</p><p>\"Everyone was moving slowly. The route was very slippery. I kept falling because of the ice.\"</p><p>His group spent last night in a hotel room in Qudang, where they relied on a generator for electricity. </p><p>When they left the hotel this morning, the snowstorm had finally subsided.</p><p>\"We're just so relieved to get help and support,\" he said.</p><p>Chen Geshuang, who was part of Mr Dong's hiking group, said the snow was about a metre deep when the group started their retreat on Sunday.</p><p>\"All of us are experienced hikers,\" Ms Chen said. \"But this blizzard was still extremely difficult to deal with. I was so lucky to get out.\"</p><p>\"This year's snow was exceptional,\" the 29-year-old outdoor enthusiast said.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images The peaks of Mount Everest covered in snow with a cloudy sky in the background\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The showstorm hit during Golden Week, a peak season for local tourism in China</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Another woman told the BBC that her husband who had been stuck in the snowstorm was slowly descending from the mountains, but thick snow cover has made his retreat extremely difficult. </p><p>\"Even for rescuers, it's not easy, they need to clear snow to make a path,\" said the woman, who declined to be named.</p><p>\"I hope my husband's team reaches [the rescue team] safely.\"</p><p>Her husband had told her that he barely slept in his tent because he was afraid of being buried in the snow, the woman said.</p><p>Another hiker, Eric Wen, told Reuters that three people in his group suffered from hypothermia even though they were adequately dressed.</p><p>They hardly slept because it was snowing too hard and his group had to clear the snow every 10 minutes. </p><p>\"Otherwise our tents would have collapsed.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp\" alt=\"Dong Shuchang A hiker dressed in a winter coat and carrying a navy backpack trudges through thick snow cover\" /><span>Dong Shuchang</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>China is in the middle of its week-long National Day holiday known as Golden Week, a peak season for local tourism.</p><p>October usually provides clear skies and friendly temperatures, making it one of the favoured months to hike in the Mount Everest area. </p><p>Many hikers have made their way to the Karma Valley hiking trail, a lesser-known but scenic route to the base of Everest - which also offers a view of the world's highest peak.</p><p>Although many people attempt to climb the summit every year, it is considered an incredibly dangerous hike. </p><p>In recent years it has been plagued with concerns of overcrowding, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5539lj1pqo\">environmental concerns</a> and a series of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-65680598\">fatal climbing attempts.</a></p><p>The region is facing extreme weather at the moment. </p><p>Neighbouring Nepal has been battered by torrential rains and floods that has killed at least 47 people, blocked roads, and washed away bridges.</p><p>On the other side of China, Typhoon Matmo has made landfall on the country's eastern coast, forcing about 150,000 people to evacuate from their homes. </p></div></article>",

Those troops also can be deployed abroad, and some units specialise in fighting wildfires or securing the US border.</p><p>Though the National Guard ultimately reports to the Department of Defence, and the president can federalise troops in certain circumstances, requests for its support typically start at a local level. </p><p>The governor of a state makes the call to activate National Guard troops during an emergency, and can request additional help from the president or other states.</p><p>National Guard troops have limited power, however. They do not enforce the law, or make arrests, seizures, or searches. And a law called the Posse Comitatus Act limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p></div><p></p><h2>How is Trump trying to use the National Guard in cities?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump has tried to circumvent the normal process for deploying the National Guard several times now.</p><p>In June, he took control of the California National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, even though California Governor Gavin Newsom objected. California filed two lawsuits against the Trump administration.</p><p>One lawsuit challenged Trump's seizure of the National Guard, but an appeals court ultimately ruled in favour of the president. In a second lawsuit, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ylyd9lkkqo\">a federal judge found </a>that Trump's use of the National Guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act.</p><p>This summer, hundreds of National Guard troops arrived in Washington, DC because of what he called a \"situation of complete and total lawlessness.\" Trump cited homelessness and crime rates as justification.</p><p>Trump has now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">authorised the deployment of 300 National Guard to Chicago </a>following immigration protests, particularly outside detention facilities. Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, alleged Trump is trying to \"manufacture a crisis\" and has filed a lawsuit.</p><p>This week, Trump attempted to deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, before a federal judge temporarily blocked the action late Sunday night.</p></div><p></p><h2>What legal basis does Trump use to deploy the National Guard?</h2><p></p><div><p>A little-known provision of US military law governs the president's authority to deploy the National Guard on his own. But up until now, presidents rarely used it.</p><p>10 US Code § 12406 allows the president to call National Guard troops from any state into service if the US is \"invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation,\" or \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the US government.</p><p>Trump invoked this law to federalise 2,000 National Guard troops in June in order to support ICE missions.</p><p>Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also cited the law in a memo deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service on 28 September.</p><p>\"We're very confident in the president's legal authority to do this,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on 6 October. \"And we're very confident we will win on the merits of the law.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>Why does Trump want to use the National Guard in Portland?</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump is again seeking to use the National Guard to respond to demonstrations, after protests near an ICE building in Portland over the weekend. </p><p>Federal officers, including with the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol agency, clashed with demonstrators who opposed Trump's mass deportation initiative.</p><p>The Portland Police Bureau said it arrested two people on 4 October who engaged \"in aggressive behaviour toward each other in the street\" and refused to follow orders. One person was in possession of bear spray and a collapsable baton.</p><p>Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that federal law enforcement fired tear gas and smoke canisters to break up the protest and made several arrests.</p><p>Trump has claimed the city is \"burning down,\" but Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said \"there is no insurrection in Portland, no threat to national security.\"</p><p>The Trump administration has moved to send 200 California National Guard troops to neighboring Oregon to respond to the protests.</p><p>But US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, has temporarily blocked his action in a pair of back-to-back rulings.</p><p>On Saturday, Judge Immergut blocked Trump from federalising the Oregon National Guard. \"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" she wrote in her ruling.</p><p>The next day, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c740elm70z7o\">she issued a temporary restraining order</a> against him deploying California's National Guard in Portland instead. </p><p>The Trump administration is expected to appeal.</p></div></article>",

The company says it saw seven million downloads in \"seven days last week\", without specifying the dates. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Arattai's downloads were less than 10,000 in August.</p><p>Arattai, which means banter in the Tamil language, had a soft launch in 2021, but not many had heard of it. The sudden surge in its popularity is being linked to the federal government's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ykznn158qo\">push for self-reliance</a> as India deals with the impact of steep US trade tariffs on its goods.</p><p>It's a message that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers have repeated over the past few weeks - make in India and spend in India.</p><p>Federal minister Dharmendra Pradhan said as much when he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/dpradhanbjp/status/1970831315504357744\">posted about Arattai on X</a> a fortnight ago urging people to use \"India-made apps [to stay] connected\". Since then, several other ministers and business leaders have also posted about Arattai. </p><p>The company says the push from the government \"definitely contributed to the sudden surge in Arattai downloads\". </p><p>\"In just three days, we saw daily sign-ups increase from 3,000 to 350,000.

While the app offers end-to-end encryption (E2EE) of video and voice calls, it does not currently extend this feature to messages.</p><p>\"The government wants to establish traceability of messages citing security concerns and this can be done easily without end-to-end encryption,\" says Shashidhar KJ, managing editor at MediaNama, a web portal that reports on tech policy in India. But this puts people's privacy at risk, he adds.</p><p>Arattai says it is actively working on rolling out end-to-end encryption for text messages.</p><p>\"We had initially planned to launch this app after E2EE, which would have happened in a couple of months,\" Mani Vembu said. \"However, the timelines have been pushed up, and we are trying to bring some critical features and infrastructure support as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>WhatsApp does offer end-to-end encryption of messages and calls but, according to its policy, it can share meta data - such as message or call logs - with governments under legally valid circumstances.</p><p>India's internet laws require social media platforms to share user data with the federal government under certain circumstances, but obtaining this data from international companies is difficult and time-consuming.</p><p>Global giants such as Meta and X also have the legal and financial backing to push against government requests or rules they think are unfair.</p><p>In 2021, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57251612\">WhatsApp sued India</a> over the government's new digital rules to regulate content on social media and streaming platforms, saying they violated WhatsApp's privacy protections. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyqxp0z7x0o\">X, too, has mounted legal challenges</a> against the Indian government's powers to block or take down content.</p><p>So, experts ask would Indian-made Arattai be able to stand up to government demands that may put users' privacy rights at risk?</p><p>Rahul Matthan, who specialises in tech law, says that until there is more clarity on Arattai's privacy architecture and Zoho's stand on sharing user-generated content with the government, many people may not feel comfortable using it.</p><p>Mr Roy says that it's possible for Zoho to feel beholden to the government, especially since federal ministers have been publicising the app. Also, he adds, it may not be easy for an Indian start-up to strongly resist when asked to comply with the country's laws and law enforcement requests.</p><p>When asked about what Arattai would do if it gets such requests, Mani Vembu says the company \"wants its users to retain full control over their data while complying with the country's information technology rules and regulations\". </p><p>\"Once full end-to-end encryption is rolled out, even we won't have access to the content of user conversations. We will be transparent with our users about any legal obligations,\" he said.</p><p>Experience suggests that odds are stacked against Indian apps, especially when habit-forming giants like WhatsApp and Facebook dominate. Whether Arattai can break through - or will fade like so many before - remains to be seen.</p><p><i>Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\"><i>Instagram</i></a><i>, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\"><i>YouTube,</i></a><i> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\"><i>X</i></a><i> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\"><i>Facebook</i></a></p></div></article>",

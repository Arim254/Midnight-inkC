    "body": "42 minutes agoJack BurgessReutersVenezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has announced on social media that he has been freed after \"almost nine months of unjust imprisonment\". His comments come shortly after the country's interim President, Delcy Rodríguez, signed an amnesty bill approved by its National Assembly that could lead to the release of hundreds of political prisoners. Rodríguez's interim government has faced pressure from the US to speed up the release of Venezuela's remaining political prisoners after delays to the law. However, Guanipa described the bill as a \"flawed document\" that excludes many Venezuelans who remain \"unjustly\" behind bars. Guanipa is the leader of Venezuela's centre-right Justice First party and was a former vice-president of the National Assembly.Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners but first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.Interim President Rodriguez has described the amnesty bill as being intended for the offering and receiving of forgiveness.But activists within the South American country have denounced delays to the law and a lack of transparency over who is being freed.",

    "body": "1 day agoInaya MohmoodNurPhoto/GettyPolice said the woman repeatedly asked ChatGPT \"Can you die from mixing sleeping pills with alcohol?\"A 21-year-old woman in South Korea has been charged with the murders of two men, after investigators discovered she had repeatedly asked ChatGPT about the dangers of mixing drugs with alcohol.Police in Seoul say that through analysis of her mobile phone they found that the suspect, identified only by her surname Kim, had asked ChatGPT \"What happens if you take sleeping pills with alcohol?\", \"How many do you need to take for it to be dangerous?\", and \"Could it kill someone?\"Kim previously told police that she did mix prescribed sedatives containing benzodiazepines into the drinks but did not know the men would die.However a police investigator said she was \"fully aware that consuming alcohol together with drugs could result in death.\"Kim was initially arrested on 11 February on the lesser charge of inflicting bodily injury resulting in death after two men died and another was left unconscious after going to a motel with her.According to police, Kim's first alleged attack took place on 28 January when she entered a motel in Suyu-dong, Gangbuk-gu, with a man in his 20s, she left the motel alone two hours later and the man was found dead inside the room the following day.Using the same method, she allegedly killed another man in his 20s on 9 February after the two checked into a different motel in Gangbuk-gu together.However, officials said that the suspects first attempt at murder via drug misuse had occurred in December last year when she gave a drink mixed with sedatives to her partner at the time, in a cafe parking lot in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, causing him to lose consciousness.According to police, after her first victim regained consciousness, Kim began to prepare her drinks with significantly higher doses of the drug.Police have said they plan to continue investigating whether there are additional victims beyond the three identified.More on this story",

    "body": "Mystery donor gives Japanese city $3.6m in gold bars to fix water system10 hours agoKoh EweOsaka City Waterworks BureauOsaka authorities received 21kg of gold bullion from a mystery donorA Japanese city has received a hefty donation to help fix its ageing water system: 21kg (46lb) in gold bars.The gold bars, worth an estimated 560 million yen ($3.6m; £2.7m), were given last November by a donor who wished to remain anonymous, Osaka Mayor Hideyuki Yokoyama told a press conference on Thursday.Home to nearly three million people, Osaka is a commercial hub located in the Japan's Kansai region and the country's third-largest city.But like many Japanese cities, Osaka's water and sewage pipes are ageing - a growing cause for safety concern.Osaka recorded more than 90 cases of water pipe leaks under its roads in the 2024 fiscal year, according to the city's waterworks bureau.\"Tackling ageing water pipes requires a huge investment. So I have nothing but appreciation,\" Yokoyama told reporters on Thursday, in response to a question about the huge gold donation.Yokoyama said the amount was \"staggering\" and he was \"lost for words\".The same mystery donor had previously given 500,000 yen in cash for municipal waterworks, he added.The city's waterworks bureau said in a statement on Thursday that it was grateful for the gold donation and would put it to good use - including tackling the deterioration of water pipes.More than 20% of Japan's water pipes have passed their legal service life of 40 years, according to local media.Sinkholes have also become increasingly common in Japanese cities, many of which have ageing sewage pipeline infrastructure.Last year, a massive sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture swallowed the cab of a truck, killing its driver. The sinkhole was believed to have been caused by a ruptured sewage pipe.That incident prompted Japanese authorities to step up efforts to replace corroded pipes across the country. But budget issues have stalled the progress of such pipe renewal works.",

An autopsy did not reveal any evidence of foul play.Griffiths co-founded Asos in 2000 and remained a significant shareholder after leaving the firm five years later.City AM/ShutterstockQuentin Griffiths, pictured in 2008A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting the family of a British national who has died in Thailand and are in contact with the local authorities.\"Police in Pattaya told the BBC Griffiths was found dead outside a luxury hotel where he had been staying in as a long-term resident in a suite on the 17th floor.He was involved in two ongoing court cases that might have caused him stress, police also told the BBC.Griffiths was separated from his second wife, a Thai national, and had reportedly been engaged in a legal dispute with her over a business they ran together, the BBC understands.He co-founded Asos in London with Nick Robertson, Andrew Regan and Deborah Thorpe.Its name originally stood for As Seen On Screen as it sold fashion inspired by clothing worn by TV and film stars.It grew to become an online fashion marketplace stocking hundreds of brands as well as its own lines and at one time was valued at more than £6bn.Its largest shareholders include Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen - who owns Danish clothing giant Bestseller and Mike Ashley, owner of Frasers Group.Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone in BangkokIf you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line",

I'm not sure about the iguanas, where are we going with that one?\" she said during her cross to the breakfast television show Today on Wednesday, apparently in response to comments from the studio hosts.With glazed eyes she then stumbled through the rest of her sports report, mixing up her words as well as the UK and the US, while studio host Karl Stefanovic could be heard laughing in the background.\"Look the cold weather is a thing, right,\" Stevanovic said unprompted afterwards. \"You can't actually move your lips.\"Social media clips of her report prompted mixed reactions from Australians. \"Good on her, nothing wrong with this. You can tell she's having an absolute ball over there,\" said one person on X, while another commented: \"If it's not a health issue, she should be sacked on the spot - very unprofessional.\"Mason, a prominent sports reporter best known for her National Rugby League coverage, appeared again on the Today show on Thursday morning.After she delivered her live report, she told viewers she wanted to \"take a moment, if that's OK, just to apologise\" for her previous appearance.She thanked viewers for messages of concern and continued: \"I'm OK, probably just a little embarrassed. \"Look, I totally misjudged the situation, I shouldn't have had a drink, especially in these conditions, it's cold, we've got altitude, and not having had dinner probably didn't help as well. But I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself.\"So in saying that, I'm genuinely really sorry and I'm thanking everyone for those messages I've received as well.\"The Today show host Jayne Azzopardi responded saying \"we know how hard you work, Danika\" while Stefanovic called her a \"legend\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoMohammad Sartaj AlamBBC Hindi, JharkhandMohammad Sartaj Alam/BBCThe spot where the woman and child were burned after a mob stormed their houseFour people have been arrested in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand for allegedly burning to death a woman and her 10-month-old son on suspicion of practising witchcraft earlier this week.The woman's husband, who was also attacked, suffered severe burns and is in hospital.Police say they are searching for more people who may be involved. The accused are in custody and haven't commented publicly yet.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, more than 2,500 people, mostly women, were killed in India on suspicion of witchcraft between 2000 and 2016.Mohammad Sartaj Alam/BBCThe murders occurred in the Kudsai hamlet of Jharkhand stateSuch cases are often reported from areas inhabited by disadvantaged tribal communities, where superstition is rife and a non-existent public health system leads to dependence on quacks for medical advice.The murders in Jharkhand occurred in the Kudsai hamlet, a remote tribal settlement of around 50 mud houses located 250km (155.3 miles) from the state capital, Ranchi.​The violence appears to have been triggered by recent incidents in the village, including rumours of sudden cattle deaths and the illness and death of a local man named Pustun Birua.His wife Jano Birua says she consulted an informal healthcare provider - common in villages where no doctors are available - when he began suffering from anxiety and fainting spells. He told her that her husband was not suffering from any physical illness.Asked why she did not take him to a hospital, she said: \"We are poor people, so it wasn't possible to take him that far.\"Meanwhile, rumours spread that Jyoti Sinku was practising witchcraft and was responsible for the man's illness.Pustun Birua died on Tuesday evening. That night, according to Jyoti's husband Kolhan Sinku who is in hospital, a mob of about a dozen people, including five women, stormed their home and set fire to his wife and child.Recalling the horror from his hospital bed, he said: ​\"I pleaded with folded hands to have the matter resolved in the village council but the attackers didn't listen to me.\"Based on the testimonies of Kolhan Sinku and another family member, the district police have registered a complaint of murder and criminal conspiracy.Police say four men have been arrested and a special police team has been set up to track down other members of the mob.They added that they would organise programmes in rural areas to raise awareness against superstitions.",

The 69-year-old was now at home and recovering from a stroke which had affected his speech, his wife Marina Adamovich said.Statkevich spent more than five years behind bars after receiving a 14-year sentence for organising what the authorities called \"mass riots\" in 2020-21. He had run unsuccessfully against Alexander Lukashenko in a 2010 presidential poll.More than 1,000 political prisoners remain in jail in Belarus, rights groups say.\"He is at home, recovering,\" Adamovich said on Thursday. \"I really hope that everything will be fine. The main problem at the moment is his speech. It's bad, it's difficult to have a conversation.\"Meanwhile, exiled Belarusian leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she was relieved that Statkevich \"is free and able to hug his wife, who waited for him for so long\".\"I want to thank everyone who keeps fighting to release all political prisoners in Belarus. We must continue until every last one is free,\" she added in a post on X.They were jailed in 2020-21, when Lukashenko brutally stamped out protests after claiming victory in presidential elections that were widely condemned as rigged.Most agreed to be sent abroad into exile. Statkevich was the only one who refused to leave the country.In exchange for the prisoner release, the US pledged to relieve some sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia, allowing it to buy parts for its aircraft.Belarus is a close ally of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Lukashenko has been in power in Belarus since 1994, quashing all opposition.",

    "body": "Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal1 day agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos dealDonald Trump has thrown the UK's Chagos deal into doubt as he launched a stinging criticism of the plan that would see the UK hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a joint UK-US military base.The US president urged Sir Keir Starmer not to \"give away Diego Garcia\" - the largest island on the archipelago and home to the base. Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.Under the deal - which was announced last May - the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years at an average cost of £101m a year. Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.The US president's position on the issue has seen rapid U-turns in recent months - from describing the planned transfer as an \"act of great stupidity\" to saying the deal was the \"best\" the prime minister could make.UK ministers have previously said that the deal could not go ahead unless it had the support of the US.The bill, aimed at enshrining the agreement into UK law, has been delayed and there is no date set for the next stage. UK Minister Alex Davies-Jones said the bill would return to the House of Lords \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\".Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.\"Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: \"It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether.\"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history.\"Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Misley Mandarin - one of the Chagossians who had travelled to the islands - said they would have to \"drag me from my beach\".He said \"there's no reason\" for the deal \"because Mauritius never owned Chagos Islands in the first place\".\"Keir Starmer, you could be a hero right now - don't ratify that deal, cancel that deal and let Chagossians come back to their homeland as British,\" he added.The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.",

    "body": "12 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterAFP via Getty ImagesEMI Records was one of the major players of the music industryWarning: this article contains offensive and derogatory languageJeffrey Epstein considered investing in music company EMI after his associate David Stern appeared to suggest it potentially offered access to women, recently released emails suggest.Epstein replied that he was interested, adding: \"Do we need help - mandelson? [sic]\"Stern and Lord Mandelson did not reply to requests for comment.Many of his emails to Epstein flagged potential deals, and in February 2010 he forwarded a short news article about the financial woes of EMI at the time. EMI is a now-defunct conglomerate that included EMI Records, formerly one of the major players of the music industry. It was acquired by Universal Music in 2012.\"Troubled industry but related to P,\" Stern wrote to Epstein.\"P\", which Epstein apparently used to refer to women, is believed to be an abbreviation of the word \"pussy\", another term Epstein often used.For birthdays and New Year greetings, Stern wished Epstein \"lots of P\", according to the recently released files. He once offered to get Epstein fashion show tickets \"to review Chinese P\". He would send Epstein a \"P factor\" for the places he visited, giving the Spanish island Ibiza 9/10, and Sarah Ferguson's 50th birthday party 0.2/10.The emails have been newly released by the US Department of JusticeAt the time Epstein had considered asking Stern for his help in an EMI investment, Lord Mandelson was First Secretary of State and Business Secretary in the UK government.Stern said it was \"too early to get Mandelson involved before i know more\".Epstein appears to have emailed Lord Mandelson a few days later, saying: \"please email me bens contact info.. or havehim cal me re emi. [sic]\"In reply, Lord Mandelson appears to say: \"Gave to [redacted]. Email is [redacted]. Talk re EMI ??\".It's not clear exactly who \"ben\" is.Epstein sent another reply to Stern, suggesting that if the deal went ahead, he would put US businessman and former Sony Music company CEO Tommy Mottola in charge of it.He wrote, \"my friend is tommy mottola former head of sony I'd like him to be brought in to fix it\".Mottola did not reply to a request for comment. US Department of JusticeAn image from the Epstein files showing David Stern at the opening of a new office for his company Asia Gateway in Beijing in 2011Epstein's proposed deal did not go ahead – and EMI's main lender Citigroup ended up taking control of the company.However later on, in 2011, Epstein's circle were still discussing a bid for EMI.Kevin Law, a businessmen in the US state of Connecticut who was often in touch with Epstein, apparently wrote: \"Tell your buddy Andrew from the UK if he's interested in EMI as we discussed I can put him in the syndicate w KKR.\" It is not clear if Epstein's \"buddy\" referred to here is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.PA MediaDavid Stern sits to the left of the Queen at a Pitch@Palace event at St James's Palace in London, in November 2016Law has said he \"never bid on EMI with any group nor did I ever do a business deal with Epstein,\" and said he did not know the former prince.The giant private equity firm KKR declined to comment. At the time KKR had a controlling stake in a rival record company, BMG.Stern was apparently still keen on acquiring a record company in 2011. He wrote: \"EMI may now come up for sale. Could actually be of interest to Chinese if structured properly. Also, most certainly great asset to have for P!\"However Epstein did not buy it then either.In November 2011, Citigroup split EMI into two parts and, the following year, sold it to Universal and a consortium involving Sony and record executive David Geffen.The DOJ files show other discussions between Epstein and associates about buying model agencies and fashion-related businesses, which also did not go ahead.French prosecutors have previously suspected that Epstein used his contact in the fashion industry, Jean-Luc Brunel, to house and transport young girls.More on this story",

    "body": "7 hours agoBernd Debusmann JrWhite House reporter Getty ImagesTrump told the Board of Peace, Trump said that talks with Iran have been 'very good' but historically difficult. US President Donald Trump says the world will find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether the US will reach a deal with Iran or take military action.At the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington DC, Trump said of negotiations with the Islamic Republic about its nuclear programme: \"We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen.\" In recent days, the US has surged military forces to the Middle East, while progress was reported at talks between American and Iranian negotiators in Switzerland. The Iranian government has told the UN Secretary-General that it will regard US bases in the region as legitimate targets if used in any military aggression against Iran. Tehran's UN mission said in a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres that Trump's rhetoric signalled a real risk of an attack - but it said Iran did not want a war.Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, have voiced opposition to any potential military action in Iran without congressional approval.In his remarks, Trump noted that Special Envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is also Trump's son-in-law, had \"some very good meetings\" with Iran. \"It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran,\" he said. \"Otherwise bad things happen.\" One day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned that Iran would be \"very wise\" to make a deal with the US, adding that Trump was still hoping for a diplomatic solution over Tehran's nuclear programme. When Trump first announced the Board of Peace, it was thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. But in the last month its mission has appeared to go beyond one conflict, with many wondering if the Trump-chaired board, made up of about two dozen countries, is meant to sideline the United Nations.US missile and aircraft struck three Iranian nuclear facilities in June last year, and the White House was reportedly discussing new attack options this week. American forces have been ramping up their presence in the region in recent weeks, including the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.In previous military operations in the Middle East, the US used RAF Fairford, in Gloucestershire, and the UK overseas territory of Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean. Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces. \"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" one of Khamenei's posts read. \"However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.\"Several members of US Congress have expressed opposition to any military action against Iran. California Democrat Ro Khanna and Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie have said they will try to force a vote on the matter next week, citing the 1973 War Powers Act. The act grants Congress the ability to check the president's power to commit the US to armed conflict.\"A war with Iran would be catastrophic,\" Khanna posted on social media. \"Iran is a complex society of 90 million people with significant air defences and military capabilities.\"He also said thousands of US troops in the region \"could be at risk of retaliation\".The chances of passage in both chambers of Congress are not strong.In January, Senate Republicans blocked a similar war powers resolution that would have required the Trump administration to obtain congressional approval before launching further military operations in Venezuela following the capture of Nicolas Maduro.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBethany BellBBC Vienna correspondentBergrettung KalsAn Austrian climber has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter after his girlfriend froze to death on Austria's highest mountain last year.The man, named only as Thomas P in line with Austrian privacy laws, has been given a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,600 (£8,400).His girlfriend, Kerstin G, died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.In a statement sent to the BBC, the court said it considered Thomas P's previous clean record and the loss of a person close to him \"to be mitigating factors\". It said it also took into account \"the public discussion on social media, which was incriminating for the defendant\".The judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced climber who works with mountain and helicopter rescue teams in Tyrol, said Thomas P was an excellent Alpinist, but that his girlfriend was light-years behind him in terms of her climbing abilities.He said the couple should have turned back as Kerstin G did not have enough experience in winter conditions.Although the judge decided Thomas P had misjudged the situation, he said he had not left her behind \"wilfully\": \"I don't see you as a murderer, I don't see you as cold-hearted.\"The court also heard from Andrea B, a former girlfriend of Thomas P, who described how he had left her alone on a previous tour on the Grossglockner in 2023. She said she had been at the end of her tether, feeling dizzy and her headlight had gone out. She said she was crying and screaming when he suddenly disappeared, walking ahead and leaving her behind.Grossglockner mountain in AustriaThe judge also questioned Thomas P's account of how he had left Kerstin on the mountainside. Hofer suggested instead that, based on her position in the photos taken by the rescue team, she may have had a fall.The court heard how the mountain rescue team found her body hanging upside down from a rock face, according to Austrian reports.\"We were amazed that she remained in that position,\" one of the rescuers told the court. If the wind had been any stronger, \"she would have fallen over the south face\".The prosecution said there were strong winds of up to 74 km/h (45 mph), and it was very cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20C, they said.They argued that as the more experienced climber, Thomas P was \"the responsible guide for the tour\". They said he failed to turn back or call for help in time to help his girlfriend.Thomas P should never have allowed himself to get into this situation, the prosecutor said.Thomas P pleaded not guilty. He told the court he was deeply sorry. He said he had loved his girlfriend, who was very sporty and that they had planned the trip together.His lawyer Kurt Jelinek said the couple had found themselves in a really difficult and stressful situation.He said Kerstin G was not inexperienced and knew what she was getting into.Her parents told the court she had been \"really active\" in mountaineering since 2020, and her mother said she would not have \"gone along blindly\".Forensic pathologist Claudia Wöss confirmed to the court that she had died of hypothermia, adding that she had found evidence of viral pneumonia and the painkiller ibuprofen in Kerstin G's body. She was unable to assess whether her physical capacity had been impaired by the illness, and if it had made a sudden decline in her condition more likely.www.foto-webcam.euThis still from webcam footage shows the couple still climbing at 21:00 on 18 JanuaryProsecutors say the couple got stuck on the mountain and that Thomas P failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:30.Video footage from the helicopter showed the couple still climbing. The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.The defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.But shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin G became exhausted close to the summit.The defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.At 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police. The content of the conversation is disputed. Rescuers said it wasn't an emergency call but the lawyer says he denies telling police that everything was fine.He scaled the summit and descended on the other side, leaving Kerstin G behind. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00.Webcam images show his torch-lit figure coming down from the summit.The trial sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders, raising questions about when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability.The case is subject to appeal.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

Let's keep fighting the fight to solve ALS.\"Nina Dobrev separately said he \"led with kindness and made everyone on our set feel seen\". The pair starred together in 2022's Redeeming Love.\"He was warm, generous, prepared, and so passionate about what he did,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"ALS is a cruel and unforgiving disease. May his memory inspire more research, awareness, and progress toward a cure.\"Eddy Chen/HBODane played the father of Oscar-nominee Jacob Elordi's Nate in Euphoria, which debuted in 2019Since sharing his diagnosis 10 months ago, Dane advocated for research and awareness surrounding the progressive condition.In November, he appeared on screen as a firefighter struggling to accept support following an ALS diagnosis in an episode of NBC medical drama Brilliant Minds.Earlier this month, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in health for his advocacy work.\"I'm trying to save my life,\" Dane told the publication, \"and if my actions can move the needle forward for myself and countless others, I'm satisfied\".In December, he had joined the board of directors of Target ALS, an organisation dedicated to research for effective ALS treatments and a cure - who said he had helped one of its campaigns surpass a fundraising target of $500,000 (£371,000).He also appeared in a video for a separate fundraising campaign in September in which he said he was \"an actor... a father and now a person living with ALS\", and spoke about \"finally, finally push toward ending this disease\".In June, he told ABC's Good Morning America that the diagnosis had made him \"angry\" because he had lost his father, who died by suicide, as child: \"There's a very good chance I'm going to be taken from my girls while they're very young.\"What is ALS?According to the NHS, MND \"encompasses several different conditions whose common feature is the premature degeneration of motor nerves (known as neurons or sometimes neurones)\".It says nearly 90% of patients with MND have the mixed ALS form of the disease.Also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare degenerative disease that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles.There is no cure for ALS, and, according to the Muscular Dystrophy Association, people usually live for three to five years after diagnosis although some can live for decades.Correction 20 February 2026: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Kim Raver played Eric Dane's on-screen wife in Grey's Anatomy. Their characters had a short-lived romance but were not married.",

    "body": "5 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinWatch: Obama gave \"classified information\" with alien comments, says TrumpUS President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to \"begin the process of identifying and releasing\" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said \"aliens are real\" on a podcast last week. \"He's not supposed to be doing that,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: \"He made a big mistake.\"Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: \"Well, I don't know if they're real or not.\"Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. \"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,\" Obama said. \"There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.\"After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: \"I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!\" Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire \"lightning\" round of questions on the podcast.There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and \"doesn't have an opinion on it\". Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that \"based on the tremendous interest shown\" he will seek the release of files \"related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters\".The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a secret Pentagon programme to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.In 2022, Congress held the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter - setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.The following year, a US House of Representatives panel on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was \"no evidence\" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoFelicity BakerEPA/ShutterstockZach Top won the first ever Grammy Award for best traditional country album earlier this monthIt's been a whirlwind few weeks for Zach Top. Three weeks ago, the rising star of country music won his first Grammy Award, in the newly created category of best traditional country album. He says it still feels like a dream.\"When they announced it, they said the title of the record and I was looking around for who was getting up to accept the award,\" he tells BBC News.\"Then it suddenly hit me, it was mine.\"Top, who has more than six million monthly listeners on Spotify, was the first winner in the new category for his second album, Ain't In It For My Health, beating icons of the country music genre including Willie Nelson.\"That seems sacrilegious to me. I certainly don't aim at awards when I'm making the music, I'd be doing it either way,\" he says. \"But it does feel really good when the rest of your industry thinks you're doing a good enough job and give you a trophy for it.\"'Hillbillies like me'The best traditional country album category was introduced at the Grammys this year alongside an award for best contemporary country album, which was won by rapper-turned-country-star Jelly Roll – after the Recording Academy said it wanted to honour both the genre's historic roots and its more modern sound.\"It's cool there's a spot for hillbillies like me,\" says Top. \"Up 'till now what they brand 'contemporary country' has taken home most of those awards.\"I feel like it's opened up a lot and new people that weren't always fans get to fall in love with the genre and all that it has to offer,\" he adds. \"But it's good artists like me have got a place to hang our hat.\"Reflecting on his win, he says: \"I still feel like it's not sunk in, but whatever happens no-one can take that away from me for the rest of my life.\"Getty ImagesTop is known for tunes including I Never Lie and South of SanityTop, 28, only burst onto the country music scene two years ago, but music has always been in his veins. Growing up in Washington state, he started playing in a band with his siblings at the age of seven.In a world where country encompasses many genres, Top is known for his more traditional sounding songs including I Never Lie, which was also Grammy nominated.\"It's just what comes out of me when I open my mouth or play the guitar,\" he explains. \"I grew up loving the really, really old stuff, so it makes sense that I landed somewhere similar.\"Top has been widely credited with bringing old-school country to younger audiences. \"For them it's something fresh and brand new,\" he says.\"We get a lot of younger people at the shows. With country music, at some point the fans always want to return to the roots and traditions of what we know and love as country music.\"I got fortunate, I came along at the right time, and people wanted something raw versus the more hip-hop influenced country music that's much more produced. I think people were ready to hear something more simple and real.\"ReutersAs well as his Grammy, the 28-year-old has won best newcomer honours at the Academy of Country Music Awards and Country Music Association AwardsTop is now in the UK ahead of his headline slot at the C2C Festival in March, the biggest country music festival outside North America, with shows in London, Belfast and Glasgow. He says he's been waiting to play for his British fans for a long time.\"If there are fans around the world that want to hear my music, I feel I have an obligation to take a show to where they are, and it's such an exciting time for country with it getting so much attention and love on a global scale.\"I'd be foolish not to embrace that and go to wherever people are falling in love with the music.\"Cold beer and country musicTop says seeing people across the world resonating with his songs never gets old. \"But it is a big undertaking,\" he adds. \"It costs a lot to get over here, so you have to make that commitment that you do want to be an artist internationally.\"When Top returns to the US, he has a busy summer of headlining country festivals in the US and writing his next album. But he says he's not feeling any pressure and instead just wants to enjoy the ride.\"I don't have any existential crisis in my head about trying to keep bearing the country music torch,\" he says.\"It's just people are going crazy for what I'm doing, so I'm going to try and keep doing what I am doing as well as I can, and hopefully they don't get tired of it.\"I'll keep bringing the cold beer and country music wherever people want it.\"",

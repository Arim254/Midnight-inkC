    "body": "Australian police have called off a search for a four-year-old boy who has been missing in the outback for almost three weeks, after fresh efforts failed to find any traces of the child.Gus Lamont was last seen playing outside his home on a remote sheep station near Yunta, about 300km (186 miles) from Adelaide, on 27 September.His grandmother left him alone for about half an hour before checking on him, only to find the boy missing, prompting one of the largest land and air searches in South Australian history.Police - who do not suspect foul play - say they will continue investigating, but that the case has become a \"recovery operation\".Last week, authorities briefly wound down the search, only to restart it on Tuesday alongside 80 Australian Defense Force personnel.Commissioner Grant Stevens said authorities were searching a wider area based on updated assessments from survivability, medical and search specialists, rather than any new information.On Friday, police confirmed that the new search had not uncovered any signs of Gus.\"The fact Gus is a small child, the terrain is extremely rugged, harsh and subject to changing weather conditions has made the searching difficult and more challenging for those involved,\" police said in a statement.About 470 sq km - an area roughly twice the size of Edinburgh - has now been covered, and a 12-person taskforce set up earlier this week is expected to continue investigating. Police have not ruled out more searches of the property in the future.Gus, who has been described as an adventurous but shy boy, was last seen wearing a grey hat, light grey long pants, boots and a blue long-sleeve T-shirt featuring a yellow Minion character. Police believe he wandered off. The case has sparked huge interest across Australia, with images of the blond, curly-haired boy featured across local media and speculation running rife online.It prompted police to ask that members of the public stop calling them with their \"opinions\", and appeal for them to source information from credible places.Their warning came after fake AI-generated images of the child spread on social media, which the BBC's Verify team investigated.Police earlier this week said the boy's family remain \"stoic\" despite the tragic circumstances.\"You can imagine just how they are feeling... without having answers as to exactly where Gus is and what's happened to him. This would be traumatic for any family,\" Commissioner Stevens said.Through a spokesperson, the Lamont family has previously said they are \"devastated\" by Gus's disappearance. \"This has come as a shock to our family and friends, and we are struggling to comprehend what has happened,\" Bill Harbison said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\"Gus's absence is felt in all of us, and we miss him more than words can express.\"",

    "body": "A US governor took home $1.4m (£1m) in a gambling windfall last year, a copy of his recent tax filing shows.JB Pritzker is reported to have won the sum while playing blackjack at a casino in Las Vegas while on holiday with his wife and friends.The two-term Democrat already has a net worth of $3.9bn (£2.9bn), according to Forbes, and is an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune.A campaign spokesperson told CBS, the BBC's partner in the US, that Pritzker planned to donate the money to charity but did not respond when asked why he had not already done so.Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, the Illinois governor described the win and himself as \"incredibly lucky\".\"You have to be to end up ahead, frankly, going to a casino anywhere,\" Pritzker added.He previously founded a charitable Chicago Poker Challenge which he says has \"raised millions of dollars\" for the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center.Pritzker and his wife, Mary Kathryn, reported a total income of $10.6m (£7.8m) in 2024, mostly from dividends and capital gains. It's understood they paid $1.6m in taxes on taxable income of $5.87m.He described his Sin City winnings as a \"net number\" across his trip. He declined to say what his winning hand was, according to CBS.\"Anybody who's played cards in a casino knows, you often play for too long and lose whatever it is you won,\" Pritzker said. \"I was fortunate enough to have to leave before that happened.\"The governor has emerged as one of US President Donald Trump's strongest critics of late, clashing with the president over the federal deployment of national troops to Chicago - actions which he called \"authoritarian\".Trump called for the jailing of the Illinois official, accusing him and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson of not doing enough to ensure the safety of federal immigration officers who are conducting raids in Chicago. Pritzker intends to seek a third term in the governor's mansion in 2026, it is understood, and has deflected questions about any ambition beyond his current position.",

    "body": "A Taiwanese airline has apologised for requesting paperwork from an employee after her death, in the latest development of a case that has sparked widespread anger.The 34-year-old Eva Air flight attendant, surnamed Sun, died earlier this month after reportedly feeling unwell during a flight.Days after her death, the airline texted her asking for proof that she applied for leave during the time she was in hospital.Ms Sun's death has enraged many online amid speculation that she was overworked. Taiwanese authorities and Eva Air are now investigating whether Ms Sun was denied medical help or discouraged from taking sick leave.In a statement provided to the BBC, Eva Air said that it had maintained contact with her family when she was in hospital and was \"deeply saddened\" by Sun's death.\"The health and safety of our employees and passengers are our highest priorities,\" the airline said, adding it was \"conducting a thorough review\" of the case.Ms Sun reportedly felt ill on 24 September during a flight from Milan to Eva Air's base in Taoyuan City in Taiwan. She was hospitalised upon arrival and eventually died on 8 October.Anonymous social media users claiming to be her colleagues have alleged Ms Sun was pushed to continue working even when she felt unwell.The China Medical University Hospital in Taichung, where she died, has not officially disclosed the cause of her death.Flight records in the last six months showed that Ms Sun had flown an average of 75 hours per month, which is within regulatory limits, Taiwan's Central News Agency (CNA) reported. She joined the airline in 2016.According to Ms Sun's family, days after her death her phone received a text message from an Eva Air representative asking for documents proving that Ms Sun had applied for leave in late September, which was the period she was in hospital.The representative asked her to send in a picture of the leave documents. The family replied the text with a copy of Ms Sun's death certificate.Senior Eva Air officials said the text was a \"mistake by an internal employee\".They told a press conference that they had personally apologised to Ms Sun's family for the error.\"The departure of Ms Sun is the pain in our hearts forever,\" Eva Air President Sun Chia-Ming said. \"We will carry out the investigation [into her death] with the most responsible attitude.\" Since 2013, Eva Air has been fined seven times, mostly for offences related to staff working overtime, CNA said.",

    "body": "Prosecutors in Bangladesh have demanded that former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina be put to death over a deadly crackdown on student-led protests last year that ousted her from power.Hasina, who has fled to India, is on trial for crimes against humanity. According to a leaked audio clip, she ordered security forces to \"use lethal weapons\" against protesters. She denies the charges.Up to 1,400 people were killed in weeks of unrest that ended Hasina's 15-year rule. It was the worst violence Bangladesh had seen since its 1971 war of independence.Chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said Hasina deserves 1,400 death sentences. \"Since that is not humanly possible, we demand at least one,\" he said.\"[Hasina's] goal was to cling to power permanently, for herself and her family,\" Islam told the court on Thursday. \"She has turned into a hardened criminal and shows no remorse for the brutality she has committed,\" he said.The protests started in July 2024 against civil service job quotas for relatives of those who fought in the 1971 war but soon escalated into a mass movement to overthrow Hasina. Some of the bloodiest scenes occurred on 5 August, the day Hasina fled by helicopter before crowds stormed her residence in Dhaka, a BBC investigation found.Police killed at least 52 people that day in a busy Dhaka neighbourhood, making it one of the worst cases of police violence in Bangladesh's history.Hasina's state-appointed defence lawyer argues that the police were forced to open fire in response to violent actions from the protesters.Hasina is being tried alongside her ex-interior minister, Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, and former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun. Prosecutors have sought the death penalty for Kamal, who is also in hiding. Chowdhury pleaded guilty in July but has not been handed a sentence.Hasina has already been sentenced to six months in prison for contempt of court, and separately faces corruption charges.Bangladesh is due hold its next elections in February, which will see Hasina's rival party BNP as frontrunner in the vote. Her party Awami League has been banned from all activities, including participating in elections.",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the bestselling memoir I Want to Die but I Want To Eat Tteokbokki has died at the age of 35.Her 2018 book, a compilation of conversations with her psychiatrist about her depression, was a cultural phenomenon with its themes of mental health resonating with readers across the world.Originally written in Korean, it found international acclaim after its English translation was published in 2022.The details surrounding her death are unclear.Baek donated her organs - her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys - which have helped to save five lives, the Korean Organ Donation Agency said in a statement on Friday.The statement also included comments from her sister, which said that Baek had wanted to \"share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope\".I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018, has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated in 25 countries.The runaway bestseller was celebrated for normalising mental health conversations and its nuanced take on inner struggles - most notably, the author's personal conflict between depressive thoughts and her appreciation for simple joys.\"The human heart, even when it wants to die, quite often wants at the same time to eat some tteokbokki, too,\" goes the book's most famous line. Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.Born in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.Anton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.For a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.A sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.Tributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"Another Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\". \"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "John Bolton, Donald Trump's former national security adviser, has pleaded not guilty to charges of mishandling classified information.The 18 charges stem from allegations he shared or retained sensitive materials, including some characterised as top secret. He entered the plea after surrendering to authorities at a federal court hearing on Friday.Bolton served during Trump's first administration but parted with the White House contentiously, and has become one of the president's most vocal public critics.The indictment makes Bolton, 76, the third of the US president's political opponents to face charges in recent weeks. Bolton has said he would defend his \"lawful conduct\".On Friday, Bolton did not respond to shouted questions from reporters as he entered the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland, to surrender to authorities.He is expected to make an initial appearance before a judge and may have to stop  at US Marshals office for \"possible\" fingerprinting and booking photo, CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US, reported.Prosecutors have accused Bolton of using personal messaging apps and email to illegally transmit sensitive information.\"These documents revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations,\" prosecutors wrote.Responding to the charges, Bolton said he would defend his \"lawful conduct\".He added he had \"become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts.\"The indictment issued this week accused Bolton of sharing \"diary-like entries\" with two unnamed individuals, and using his personal email account to transmit messages with sensitive materials.The indictment also states that between 2019 and 2021, Bolton was allegedly the target of a hacking attack from a \"cyber actor believed to be associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran\" gained access to his account, exposing the classified materials.\"Like many public officials throughout history, Ambassador Bolton kept diaries – that is not a crime,\" Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in response to the charges.Lowell described the records in question as \"unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021\".An indictment in the US justice system is a formal accusation issued by a grand jury - a group of members of the public set up by a prosecutor to review evidence to determine if a case should proceed.Bolton has been scrutinised for his handling of classified information since 2020, when he sought to publish a book about his time in the first Trump administration.The Justice Department tried to block the book's release, alleging it could contain classified information. A federal judge ruled against the government, but rebuked Bolton in his decision, writing he had \"gambled with the national security of the United States\".An investigation into Bolton continued into the Joe Biden administration, but did not lead to charges.The Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Bolton's house and office in August, signalling an active investigation.Trump has frequently attacked Bolton in social media and criticised him in public statements. In 2020, when Bolton published his book, The Room Where it Happened: A White House Memoir, the president said he \"illegally released much Classified Information\" in the book and called his former adviser a \"lowlife who should be in jail.\"Upon retuning to office, Trump revoked Bolton's security detail this year, along with protection for several other political opponents.Bolton's indictment comes after Trump's Justice Department brought criminal charges against two of his political opponents: former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",

    "body": "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be \"fully operational by the end of 2027\", as part of a drive to toughen defences against Russia and be fully prepared for possible conflict by 2030.\"Drones are already redefining warfare. Having drone defences is no longer optional for anyone,\" Kallas said, referring to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and fears that Moscow may attack the EU.The European Commission's \"defence roadmap\" also proposes strengthening the EU's eastern borders and building air and space \"shields\".Several EU nations have faced Russian incursions into their airspace and US President Donald Trump has urged the bloc to do more to defend itself.The European defence plan comes amid growing European fears that Russia will continue its westward aggression after the war in Ukraine is over, as well as continued ambiguity over Trump's long-term commitment to European security.\"Danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends. It is clear we need to toughen our defences against Russia,\" Kallas told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.Although there seems little chance of the war ending soon, Trump says he is now having a \"lengthy\" conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone, ahead of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday. Trump has indicated that if Putin does not not move to end the war, the US could send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles - a potential move already described as \"escalation\" by the Kremlin.Standing alongside Kallas, European Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius stressed that \"our roadmap shows all the major milestones to achieve defence readiness by 2030, so we can deter Russian aggression, prevent war and preserve peace\".Putin has repeatedly denied that Moscow has any aggressive plans towards the EU. In June, he said the \"myth that Russia is planning to attack Europe, Nato countries is an unbelievable lie... nonsense\".The EU's executive Commission said the 27-member union should be ready by 2030 to \"respond to any crisis, including high-intensity conflict\".It also urged the bloc to \"close critical capability gaps\" - including in air and missile defence, and artillery systems - \"through joint development and procurement\".Many EU countries are also members of Nato and its chief, Mark Rutte, said they were working together to protect member states on the eastern flank from aerial threat.The EU stressed its \"flagship\" projects would be developed in \"close co-ordination\" with Nato, and would not duplicate the Western defensive alliance's work.No estimates were given to the overall cost, but Kubilius said \"we're not talking here about hundreds of billions\".The \"defence roadmap\" still needs to be approved by member states at a leaders' summit next week. However, a number of EU states have already backed plans for a multi-layered \"drone wall\" to quickly detect, then track and destroy Russian drones.In recent weeks,  tensions have escalated between the EU and Russia, after Poland and Romania - both Nato members - said Russian drones had breached their airspace.And Estonia - another Nato member - in September requested urgent consultations  with other alliance members after saying that Russian warplanes had violated its airspace and stayed there for 12 minutes.Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, said its planes were on a \"scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states\".A number of European politicians and military experts have said that Russia's aim is to test Nato's capabilities and and try to sow discord within the alliance. Several Nato members reacted to the reported Russian incursions by sending troops, artillery, and air defence systems to secure the alliance's eastern flank.",

    "body": "Five takeaways from NYC mayoral debate as Mamdani and Cuomo clash 3 hours agoKayla EpsteinRockefeller Center,Grace Eliza GoodwinRockefeller Center andSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Sliwa, Mamdani and Cuomo debate grocery bills, Trump and Gaza The three leading candidates for New York City mayor took the stage at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan on Thursday to make a case to lead America's biggest city.They tangled over housing, Israel and Gaza, and President Donald Trump, with frontrunner Zohran Mamdani pressing main competitor Andrew Cuomo during the heated two-hour debate. With early voting set to begin next week, neither dominated the evening - though both declared victory afterwards. The most recent polling suggests Mamdani has widened his lead to 46%, while Cuomo stands at 33%. The outcome could have political implications beyond the Empire State as Trump looms large, and whoever wins will likely face pressure from Washington in some form.The Democratic Party nationally is likely watching to see if the America's biggest Democratic stronghold chooses an establishment, centrist figure in Cuomo - who is running as an independent - or the progressive Mamdani.Republicans also will watch to see if their candidate, Curtis Sliwa, continues to make inroads with his public safety platform.Here are five big takeaways from the night.1. Mamdani pressed on views on PalestiniansMamdani's past statements on Israel and Palestinians came up several times during the night in questions from moderators and opponents' criticisms.The candidate has stressed his support for Palestinians and statehood, and has fiercely criticised Israel's military operation in Gaza.He also was criticised by Cuomo for declining to condemn the phrase \"globalise the intifada\". Many Jews argue this slogan is an antisemitic call for violence, but pro-Palestinian activists say it refers to a call for international solidarity with Palestinians.\"Why wouldn't he condemn Hamas? Why wouldn't he condemn Hasan Piker?\" said Cuomo, referring to the left-wing political commentator and streamer, who once said \"America deserved 9/11\".In response, Mamdani said: \"I want to be very clear; the occupation is a reference to international law and the violation of it.\"And he added that the comments by Mr Piker - who he sat with for an interview on Youtube earlier this year - \"objectionable and reprehensible\". Pressed by moderators on whether he could reassure voters concerned about his past comments, Mamdani said he would seek to serve as a mayor for all New Yorkers, including its large and ideologically diverse Jewish population.But Cuomo attacked Mamdani for his views, calling the New York state assemblyman a \"divisive personality across the board\".Angelina Katsanis/Pool via REUTERS2. The fourth man: Donald TrumpThere were three candidates at tonight's debate but a fourth name kept coming up: Donald Trump.The president has implied he wants to send the National Guard into cities controlled by Democrats and has moved to withhold government funds for infrastructure projects in New York City. Trump has also prioritised the city for his mass deportation policy, and the mayor — who has little power over federal immigration enforcement — will likely have to weigh the city's response. Sliwa, the Republican, noted that the mayor would need to get along with Trump regardless of political views. But Mamdani made his opposition to the president explicit from his very first response, promising to \"take on Trump\".Cuomo, meanwhile, positioned himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the current White House, warning \"it will be Mayor Trump\" if Mamdani is elected.\"I fought Donald Trump,\" he told voters. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\"3. Affordability front and centreAs large as Trump looms, the biggest policy issue around this mayoral election is affordability. New Yorkers face high costs of living on everything - especially rent and groceries.In his opening statement, Sliwa acknowledged the \"really serious issues of affordability\" facing the city. He called for the next mayor to free up vacant apartments in NYCHA - New York's public housing programme — and allow people to move in.The moderators directly asked each candidate how much they paid for rent, groceries and whether they paid off credit card debt monthly. The candidates pitched a volley of proposals to tackle the cost of living, including Mamdani's plan to make buses free and Cuomo's proposal to place income limits on people who resided in rent-stabilised apartments.Cuomo criticised Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilised apartment -a form of affordable housing - even though his parents are wealthy (his mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair).Cuomo also opposed Mamdani's proposed rent freeze on stabilised apartments, saying it would only postpone future increases, force building owners into bankruptcy, and fail New Yorkers who don't live in rent-stabilised apartments.\"If you think that the problem in this city is that my rent is too low, vote for him,\" Mamdani said in response. \"If you know the problem in this city is that your rent is too high, vote for me.\"Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announces run for New York City mayorFULL COVERAGE: Mamdani, Cuomo, Sliwa debateWho is Zohran Mamdani?How Mamdani stunned New York - and what Democrats can learn from his win4. Cuomo's controversies still loomCuomo touted his decades of experience in office, rising from federal housing secretary during President Bill Clinton's administration to New York governor.However, controversies surrounding his governorship have shadowed his campaign. He resigned as governor in 2021 after an investigation by the state attorney general found he had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo apologised for acting \"in a way that made people feel uncomfortable\" but denied allegations.The New York attorney general also investigated his administration for undercounting nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, finding he understated the actual number of deaths.Mamdani attacked Cuomo on these matters, accusing him of \"sending seniors to their death in nursing homes\", and accused him of lacking integrity.Cuomo said the allegations about harming seniors in nursing homes were \"totally false\".\"During Covid, everyone did whatever they could in this state, and there have been numerous investigations where they've gone through it, and they said we followed federal guidance,\" Cuomo said. \"But yes, people died during Covid. And my heart breaks for everyone that broken, that died in this state and across this nation.\"Sliwa, too, attacked Cuomo for the \"lawsuits filed against you for sexual harassment\". The former governor rebutted that the case brought by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the misconduct claims, \"was political\".5. Curtis Sliwa makes his markSliwa held his own as the only Republican on stage. His voting bloc might be in the minority in New York City, but the 2024 presidential election revealed that residents prioritise public safety issues and Sliwa hammered that repeatedly. As the founder of the Guardian Angels, a New York City organization devoted to crime prevention, he seized the opportunity to connect with voters.The longtime New York media and political personality knew how to make himself heard. He frequently interjected, telling moderators he wanted to speak, and elbowing his way into the debate's most heated moments. From centre stage, he took swings at both opponents in equal measure.He felt confident after the debate, saying his night went \"extraordinarily well\" and likening his opponents to \"two kids in the schoolyard\".Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "14 hours agoJohn Sudworthin Kyiv andSarah SmithNorth America editorNews of the phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, in which they agreed to meet in person to discuss the war in Ukraine, will have come as an unwelcome surprise to Kyiv.The country is being hit hard. The last 24 hours alone have seen Russia launch dozens of missiles and more than 300 drones at multiple targets.Once again, they include a large amount of civilian infrastructure with further damage to the country's gas supply network, just as the first signs of cold herald a long, hard winter ahead.Attacks on the electrical grid are already leading to nationwide power outages.For Ukraine's government it's a sign of Russian desperation.The frontlines are at effective stalemate, involving huge loss of life for incremental territorial gains.Watch: Trump says he will have 'separate but equal' meetings with Putin and ZelenskyAnd the Russian economy is feeling the effects of the Ukrainian military's increasingly effective drone strikes on oil depots.So, President Volodymyr Zelensky's big hope was for more American military assistance to keep up that pressure.Before he boarded his plane to Washington, he seemed to believe that things were going his way.There was optimistic talk about Trump beginning to see the world through Ukraine's eyes, a big shift from that angry, humiliating Oval Office exchange in February when he accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\".The failure of the Trump-Putin Alaska summit in August and the intensifying bombardment of Ukraine were – it was thought – all causing the US president to lose patience with his \"good friend\", as he has called Putin.There were high hopes that Friday's meeting would finally yield the prize Ukraine has been seeking - Trump's permission for the purchase of long-range Tomahawk missiles.Trump's frustration with Putin was obvious on Sunday when he told reporters: \"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so.\"But how much of a game changer the missiles would really be is in much dispute among military experts and, with the complicated logistics, it could be months before they were deployed.But at the very least they would add to Ukraine's ability to strike deep into the heart of Russia and with a much more powerful weapon than any it currently possesses.They would also send a potent physical message to Putin about America's shifting allegiances.So, the two-and-a-half-hour Trump-Putin phone call, that took place while Zelensky was in flight, somewhat steals a march on the Ukrainian president's big moment.So far, though, he's putting something of a brave face on it, suggesting in a post sent on his arrival in Washington that Russia was panicking.The Kremlin was \"rushing to renew dialogue\", he said, precisely because of all the talk of the Tomahawks.Other analysts will see less panic and more of a classic Putin play at work in the phone call, which was said by the Kremlin to have taken place at Russia's behest.The issue of the Tomahawks was indeed discussed, with Putin reinforcing his view that their deployment would be seen as a significant act of provocation.The two men apparently discussed the \"colossal prospects\" – in Russia's words – for trade if peace were achieved.And then they agreed to their summit in Hungary. That will probably happen within the next two weeks, Trump said.Trump says he will meet Putin in Hungary after 'very productive' callAs Ukraine faces its fourth winter of war, few people here had much belief in Trump's claim that he could turn his \"success\" in the Middle East into momentum towards peace in Ukraine.One woman the BBC spoke to, badly injured in a Russian strike on a civilian railway carriage, shrugged her shoulders when we asked her if she saw an easy way out.\"A person like Putin can't be trusted,\" she said from her hospital bed.After touching down in Washington on Thursday evening, Zelensky met representatives of defence companies who produce the powerful weapons he says he needs to strengthen Ukraine's protection. He will still ask the White House for the Tomahawks.But Trump's willingness to give them was always in doubt and must, surely, be now further called into question.Meanwhile, Russia is being given something.A familiar pattern is developing. Every time Trump grows increasingly frustrated with Putin's intransigence over Ukraine he is then placated by a conversation with the Russian president.Each time they speak he seems to be persuaded of Putin's point of view and backs off his threats to apply tougher sanctions or supply more destructive weapons.The Hungary summit, offered without concessions, doesn't look like much of a loss of American patience.Never mind the Tomahawks. For now, Ukraine has been given a long-range curveball instead.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "7 hours agoSean SeddonEPABenjamin Netanyahu addressed a memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl cemetery in JerusalemIsrael's prime minister has told a memorial for victims of the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that he is \"determined\" to secure the return of the dead hostages still in Gaza, and that the country will continue to fight terrorism with \"full force\".Benjamin Netanyahu made the comments hours after Hamas returned the bodies of two more hostages but said it was not able to access the remaining 19.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all the bodies in line with last week's Gaza ceasefire deal, though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.Hamas said later it remained committed to the ceasefire, including \"keenness to hand over all remaining corpses\".In a statement, it accused Netanyahu of impeding its ability to search for hostages' remains by not allowing heavy machinery and diggers into the Gaza Strip.The group is continuing to try to recover captives' bodies. In footage broadcast on Al Jazeera, Hamas gunmen appear to guard bulldozers digging in the dark in the southern city of Khan Younis. The BBC understands that Hamas has given mediators coordinates and aerial photographs of bodies' locations.US President Donald Trump meanwhile has signalled he was willing to see fighting resume if Hamas \"continues to kill people\", seemingly referencing reports of violence inside Gaza, where Hamas has been accused of violently targeting internal rivals in recent days.Writing on his Truth Social platform, the US president said \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill\" if the group did not desist. Trump has previously ruled out putting American soldiers on the ground in Gaza.Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli government confirmed that two bodies handed over by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross on Wednesday night had been identified as Inbar Hayman and Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash.Their return, which was overseen by masked Hamas gunmen in Gaza City, took the number of dead hostages returned since Monday to nine out of 28. All 20 living hostages were released on Monday, in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has responded to the delay in returning all the bodies by threatening to restrict the amount of aid flowing into Gaza.On Thursday, Netanyahu addressed an official memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl national cemetery in Jerusalem, two days after the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the 7 October attack.The prime minister said he remained committed to securing the return of all the dead Israeli and foreign hostages, and reiterated his government's willingness to return to military action if Israel was attacked again.He said: \"Our fight against terrorism will continue with full force. We will not allow evil to raise its head. We will exact the full price from anyone who harms us.\"The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,967 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.ReutersIsraeli Bedouin soldier Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash was buried on Thursday, a day after his body was returned by HamasThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel said Netanyahu's government should \"immediately halt the implementation\" of the ceasefire deal until the 19 bodies were returned. After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior advisers to US President Donald Trump said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing. The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible. One senior US adviser pointed to the level of destruction in Gaza as one reason the search might be slowed, and said rewards could be offered to civilians with information about the location of remains. Hamas has complained to mediators that more than 20 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on Friday.Israel's military, which still controls more than half the territory, has said that it opens fire to remove threats to its troops.Watch: Netanyahu responds to Trump comment that he’s not \"the easiest\" to work withMeanwhile in Gaza, work is under way to identify the bodies of Palestinians returned by Israel in recent days in exchange for the hostages' bodies. A further 30 were returned on Thursday, taking the total to 120.There had been some reports that the Rafah crossing with Egypt would reopen on Thursday, having been shut since the Gaza side was seized by Israeli forces in May 2024.The ceasefire deal specifies its reopening would be \"subject to the same mechanism implemented\" during a temporary ceasefire earlier this year, when wounded Palestinians were briefly allowed to pass through to receive medical treatment.On Thursday, an official from Israeli military body Cogat said: \"The date for the opening of the Rafah crossing for the movement of people only will be announced at a later stage, once the Israeli side, together with the Egyptian side, completes the necessary preparations.\"The official also stressed that \"aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing\". Instead, they said, it would continue to enter Gaza through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel and other crossings following Israeli security inspections.",

    "body": "15 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterReutersLast week, China's Ministry of Commerce published a document that went by the name of \"announcement No. 62 of 2025\".But this wasn't just any bureaucratic missive. It has rocked the fragile tariffs truce with the US.The announcement detailed sweeping new curbs on its rare earth exports, in a move that tightens Beijing's grip on the global supply of the critical minerals - and reminded Donald Trump just how much leverage China holds in the trade war.China has a near-monopoly in the processing of rare earths - crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets.Under the new rules, foreign companies now need the Chinese government's approval to export products that contain even a tiny amount of rare earths and must declare their intended use.In response, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods and put export controls on key software.\"This is China versus the world. They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world, and we're not going to have it,\" said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.On Thursday, China said the US had \"deliberately provoked unnecessary misunderstanding and panic\" over the rare earths restrictions.\"Provided the export licence applications are compliant and intended for civilian use, they will be approved,\" a commerce ministry spokesperson added.This week, the world's two biggest economies also imposed new port fees on each other's ships.The flare-up in the trade war brings to an end months of relative calm after top US and Chinese officials brokered a truce in May.Later this month, Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are expected to meet and experts have told the BBC the rare earths restrictions will give China the upper hand.China's new controls are bound to \"shock the system\" as they target vulnerabilities in American supply chains, said international business lecturer Naoise McDonagh from Australia's Edith Cowan University.\"The timing has really upset the kind of timeline for negotiations that the Americans wanted,\" he added.Getty ImagesRare earth minerals are crucial for the production of fighter jets like the F-35Rare earth minerals are essential for the production of a whole range of technology such as solar panels, electric cars and military equipment.For example, a single F-35 fighter jet is estimated to need more than 400kg (881.8lb) of rare earths for its stealth coatings, motors, radars and other components.China's rare earth exports also account for around 70% of the world's supply of metals used for magnets in electric vehicle motors, said Natasha Jha Bhaskar from advisory firm the Newland Global Group.Beijing has worked hard to gain its dominance of the global rare earth processing capacity, said critical minerals researcher Marina Zhang from the University of Technology Sydney.The country has nurtured a vast talent pool in the field, while its research and development network is years ahead of its competitors, she added.While the US and other countries are investing heavily to develop alternatives to China for supplies of rare earths, they are still some way from achieving that goal.With its own large deposits of rare earths, Australia has been tipped as a potential challenger to China. But its production infrastructure is still underdeveloped, making processing relatively expensive, Ms Zhang said.\"Even if the US and all its allies make processing rare earths a national project, I would say that it will take at least five years to catch up with China.\"The new restrictions expand measures Beijing announced in April that caused a global supply crunch, before a series of deals with Europe and the US eased the shortages.The latest official figures from China show that exports of the critical minerals were down in September by more than 30% compared to a year ago.But analysts say China's economy is unlikely to be hurt by the drop in exports.Rare earths make up a very small part of China's $18.7tn a year economy, said Prof Sophia Kalantzakos from New York University.Some estimates put the value of the exports at less than 0.1% of China's annual gross domestic product (GDP).While rare earths' economic value to China may be tiny their strategic value \"is huge\", she said, as they give Beijing more leverage in talks with the US.Despite accusing China of \"betrayal\", Bessent has left the door open to negotiations.\"I believe China is open to discussion and I am optimistic this can be de-escalated,\" he said.During a meeting with the US private equity group Blackstone's chief executive Stephen Schwarzman on Thursday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also highlighted the need for talks.\"The two sides should engage in effective communication, properly resolve differences and promote stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations,\" Wang said, according to the ministry's website.What China has done recently is \"getting its ducks in a row\" ahead of those trade talks with the US, said Prof Kalantzakos.In curbing rare earth exports, Beijing has found its \"best immediate lever\" to pressure Washington for a favourable deal, Ms Bhaskar said.Getty ImagesTop US officials Scott Bessent and Jamieson Greer blasted China as \"unreliable\"Jiao Yang from Singapore Management University believes that although Beijing holds the cards in the short-run, Washington does have some strategic options at its disposal.The US could offer to lower tariffs, which is likely to be attractive to Beijing as the trade war has hit its manufacturers hard, said Prof Jiao said.China's economy is reliant on the income from the goods it makes and exports. The latest official figures show its exports to the US were down by 27% compared to a year ago.Washington can also threaten to hit China with more trade restrictions to hamper efforts to develop its technology sector, said Prof McDonagh.For example, the White House has already targeted China's need for high-end semiconductors by blocking its purchases of Nvidia's most advanced chips.But experts say that is likely to have only limited effects.Measures targeting Beijing's tech industry may slow China but won't \"stop it dead in the water,\" said Prof McDonagh.China has shown with its recent economic strategy that it is willing to take some pain to achieve its long-term goals, he added.\"China can carry on even if it costs a lot more under US export controls.\"But if China cuts off these rare earth supplies, that can actually stop everyone's industry. That's the big difference.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoSean SeddonReutersZelensky is on his third visit to Washington since JanuaryUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday, as Trump weighs whether to arm Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles capable of striking deep into Russia.Their meeting comes a day after Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks in Hungary.Trump said the call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow will meet next week.As Zelensky arrived in the US, his third visit since January, he said Moscow was \"rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks\".Zelensky has called on the US to provide Ukraine with the advanced missiles, which have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles).Asked earlier this week if Trump was considering giving Ukraine Tomahawks, he said: \"We'll see... I may.\" But when asked about the same prospect following his call with Putin, Trump said \"we can't deplete\" the US stockpile of Tomahawks, adding \"we need them too... so I don't know what we can do about that\".Putin-Trump call a curveball for Zelensky ahead of his visitWriting on his Truth Social platform after his call with Putin concluded, Trump said he and the Russian president \"spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over\". He said \"high level advisers\" from both countries would meet at an unspecified location next week, with the Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading the American delegation. Trump also said he would update Zelensky on his talks with Putin on Friday, adding: \"I believe great progress was made with today's telephone conversation.\"He later told reporters he expected to meet Putin in Hungary \"within two weeks\".Trump has been seen as more sympathetic toward Russia than his predecessor Joe Biden, but in recent months has taken a stiffer line with Putin. He had hoped a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August would help convince Putin to enter into comprehensive peace talks to end the war - but that meeting failed to produce a decisive breakthrough. They spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.Putin spoke with Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.The Russian president briefed Orban on his phone call with Trump, while the Hungarian leader said he would help organise a possible summit in Budapest. Putin also noted plans to discuss further steps to resolve \"the situation in Ukraine\" with US representatives, the state-owned Tass news agency reported.The planned meeting in Budapest was \"great news for the peace-loving people of the world\", Orban wrote on X on Thursday, and he added that he had spoken to Trump by phone.Trump and Putin could have another talk a week after Rubio's meeting with advisors, Orban told state radio. \"Since the EU is pro-war, it is logical that it will be left out of this peace process,\" he added.Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaHours before the Trump-Putin call, Russia launched one of its largest attacks of the year on Ukraine, including 28 ballistic missiles, and 320 drones, according to Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Olga Stefanishyna.Stefanishyna said Russia launching overnight strikes on Ukraine before the call \"exposes Moscow's real attitude toward peace\".In a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS, she added: \"These assaults show that Moscow's strategy is one of terror and exhaustion. The only effective response is pressure - through tougher sanctions, reinforced air defense, and the supply of long-range capabilities.\"Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Though Trump had indicated that he was considering sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, he told reporters the US could not deplete its stockpile. \"We need them too\", he said after Friday's call with Putin.Ukraine’s navy does not have the necessary ships to operate them, and the US has a small number of launchers needed for the missiles - typically mounted on ships and submarines. The US reinstated its Tomahawk land-based mobile launcher programme, Typhon, in 2023. Its military has at least two Typhon launchers, but it is unlikely to have many more.The possibility of the US sending Ukraine long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles would cause “extreme concern”, Peskov said on Sunday, adding such a move would be viewed in Russia as \"a major escalation.\"ReutersPutin and Trump last met in person at a US base in Alaska in August 2025During his presidential election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to power. Trump's strained relations with Zelensky came to a head on 28 February when he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president in the Oval Office on live television. But public relations with Zelensky have vastly improved in recent months. In September, Trump signalled a major shift in his view of the conflict, saying he  believed Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\", a far cry from his public calls for Kyiv to cede territory occupied by Russia. In late July, Trump set Putin a deadline of less than a fortnight to agree to a ceasefire or face sweeping sanctions, including measures against countries which still trade with Russia.But he did not follow through the threat after Putin agreed to meet Trump in Alaska, which the US president hailed as a significant diplomatic success at the time, despite it not producing any tangible outcome.Earlier on Thursday, India's foreign ministry cast doubt on a claim made by Trump a day earlier saying Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to stop purchasing Russian oil.An Indian government spokesman said he was \"not aware of any conversation between the two leaders\" taking place the previous day, after Trump said Modi had assured him purchases would stop \"within a short period of time\".The US has pushed for countries - in particular India, China and Nato members - to stop buying Russian energy in an effort to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin. Zelensky has also repeatedly echoed those calls.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

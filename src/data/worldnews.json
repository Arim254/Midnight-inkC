    "body": "Romania's defence ministry has said the US intends to reduce some of its troops stationed on Nato's eastern flank.Between 900 and 1,000 American troops will remain in Romania, Bucharest said - down from 1,700. The ministry said the decision was expected and that the \"resizing\" of US forces was a result of the new priorities of the Trump presidential administration.The Pentagon said the decision did not constitute a \"withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to Nato and Article 5\". Article 5 holds that Nato members will come to the defence of an ally which comes under attack, and has long been seen as the main deterrent against potential Russian aggression.Defence Minister Ionut Mosteanu stated that his US counterpart Pete Hegseth had recently conveyed to the Europeans that they needed to pay more attention to their own defence and that the US was shifting its attention towards the Indo-Pacific region.One US brigade at the Mihai Kogalniceanu airbase - set to be Nato's largest in Europe - would be rotated out and not replaced, Mosteanu said.The brigade has \"elements\" in Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, Mosteanu said, although it was unclear whether US troops were going to be pulled out of these countries too.Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Wednesday that Warsaw had \"no information\" about a possible reduction of US troops on its territory. The presence of US troops at Romania's Deveselu and Campia Turzii bases would remain unchanged, Ionut Mosteanu added.Since taking office in January US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his wish to shift the focus of US military commitment from Europe to the Indo-Pacific region, and has repeatedly urged European Nato members to take more responsibility for the continent's defence.But the announcement of the US troop withdrawal from Romania will be concerning for Eastern European countries, many of which feel they have reason to fear a Russian attack in the future.Shortly after the announcement from Bucharest, a Nato official stressed that Washington's commitment to the Nato alliance remained \"clear\" and adjustments were \"not unusual\".\"Even with this adjustment, the US force posture in Europe remains larger than it has been for many years, with many more US forces on the continent than before 2022,\" the official said in a statement.The Pentagon also stressed that the US maintained a \"robust presence\" throughout Europe as well as \"the ability to array forces and capabilities to meet objectives... including President Trump's commitment to defend Nato allies\".The US has more than 100,000 military personnel deployed in Europe, according to figures from late last year.Last month Nato announced the creation of a mission dubbed Eastern Sentry, which it said would enhance the alliance's vigilance along the entire eastern flank. The decision came after a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace, in the most serious incident of its kind since the war began in February 2022. Days later,  Romania reported that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, and Estonia said Russian warplanes had violated its airspace too.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesLizard Island is about 250km (155 miles) north of CairnsAn 80-year-old Australian woman has been found dead on a Great Barrier Reef island after being left behind by the cruise ship she was travelling on.The woman had been hiking on Lizard Island, 250km (155 miles) north of Cairns, with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer cruise ship on Saturday but is believed to have broken off from the group to have a rest.The ship left the island around sunset but returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing. A major search operation found her body on Sunday morning. No details have been released.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said it was investigating and would meet the ship's crew later this week.It is understood the woman, who has not been named, was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, with tickets costing in the tens of thousands of dollars for the journey.She had joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, before she decided she needed to rest, according to the Courier Mail newspaper.But she did not make it back to the ship, which then departed without her.Traci Ayris was sailing near the island last weekend and told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that she saw a helicopter using a spotlight to search a walking trail on the island at around midnight on Saturday. She said about seven people with torches went to the island to search but it was called off at around 03:00 on Sunday (18:00 GMT Saturday) with a helicopter returning on Sunday morning when the body was apparently found.\"We knew she was dead because they called everyone back from the search immediately,\" she told ABC.\"And no-one went to the spot that the chopper was hovering over until later that day when the police arrived.\"A spokesperson for Amsa said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 on Saturday by the ship's captain.The authority said it would work with other relevant agencies to investigate the case and that it takes the safety of passengers and crew onboard commercial vessels seriously.Ms Ayris also said the incident was clearly distressing for crew and passengers.\"It was very sad in this paradise to have this tragedy occur. It should have been a happy time for that lovely lady.\"A report into the \"sudden and non-suspicious death\" of the woman will be prepared for the coroner, Queensland police said.Coral ExpeditionsThe incident happened on the first stop of a 60-day trip around AustraliaCoral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield said staff had contacted the woman's family and were offering support over the \"tragic death\".\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,\" Mr Fifield said.\"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is under way,\" he added.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.The vessel has continued its voyage to Darwin.Additional reporting by Tom McArthur",

    "body": "Sudan's military government has ordered two senior officials at the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) to leave the country amid widespread famine sparked by a gruelling civil war that erupted in April 2023.The WFP said directors of its Sudan operation were declared \"personae non grata\" and told to go within 72 hours, without explanation.The decision comes days after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), captured the key city of el-Fasher in Darfur from the military after an 18-month siege, which included a food blockade.The WFP said the expulsions came a \"pivotal time\" as humanitarian needs in Sudan had \"never been greater with more than 24 million people facing acute food insecurity\".Although the military government has not given a reason for the expulsions, it has previously accused aid groups of breaking local laws and releasing misleading reports on famine conditions.The government said the expulsion will not affect the country's cooperation with the WFP, state news agency Suna reported.The WFP says it is engaging with Sudanese authorities to resolve the matter.A simple guide to what is happening in SudanA pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zoneTwo-and-a-half years of fighting between the army and the RSF escalated on Sunday, when the RSF seized el-Fasher in the western region of Darfur.There are now fears for the fate of the estimated 250,000 people in the city, many from non-Arab communities. Reports of atrocities, including mass-killings, have been mounting since the city fell.\"The situation in el-Fasher is extremely dire and there are violations taking place on the roads, including looting and shooting, with no distinction made between young or old,\" one man who managed to escape el-Fasher told the BBC Arabic's Sudan Lifeline programme.\"We managed to reach Tawila, where humanitarian organisations are present. We are grateful that we arrived, even though we have been sleeping on the roads.\"Tawila is a town about 60km (37 miles) west of el-Fasher and already hosts around 800,000 people - many of whom escaped from the vast Zamzam camp near el-Fasher when it was attacked by the RSF in April.Since the conflict erupted, RSF fighters and allied Arab militia in Darfur have been accused of targeting people from non-Arab ethnic groups - allegations the RSF denies.On Tuesday, the el-Fasher Resistance Committee, a group of local activists, accused the RSF of executing wounded people receiving treatment at the city's Saudi Hospital.Researchers at Yale University supported this allegation, saying satellite images appear to show \"clusters\" of bodies within the hospital grounds.International bodies such as the European Union and African Union have expressed alarm, while locals say the current situation is reminiscent of the region's darkest days.Darfur experienced one of the world's gravest humanitarian disasters from 2003 to 2020.The Janjaweed, a militia who were accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing during this time, morphed into what is now the RSF.Sudanese-American poet Emtithal Mahmoud, who has family in el-Fasher and lost relatives in the previous Darfur conflict, said she felt a \"genocide\" was occurring once again as seen from social media footage being posted by the RSF.\"The only difference… is that now it's live streamed and video taped and sent around because the RSF understands that they can act with impunity,\" Ms Mahmoud told the BBC.The RSF denies targeting civilians.

At least four protesters have been killed during clashes between security forces and opposition supporters since Cameroon's election on 12 October, with 92-year-old President Paul Biya winning an eighth consecutive term.Tchiroma Bakary insists he won the election, a claim dismissed by Biya's ruling party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM).Violent crackdowns by police and security officers on protesters have alarmed the international community, with the UN, African Union and EU calling for restraint.The 92-year-old president who never losesOn Tuesday, Nji accused Tchiroma Bakary of organising what he said were \"illegal\" protests leading to the loss of lives, and also criticised him for declaring victory in the election.He added that Tchiroma Bakary's \"accomplices responsible for an insurrectionary plan\" will also face legal action.Paul Biya, who came to power in 1982 and is now the world's oldest head of state, won the 12 October election with 53.7% of the vote, compared to 35.2% for Tchiroma Bakary, according to Cameroon's Constitutional Council.Tchiroma Bakary is yet to respond to the government's decision to try him, but he had previously told the BBC that he would not accept a stolen vote - and that he was not afraid of being arrested.On election result day, he said armed men opened fire on protesters assembled near his residence in Garoua, fatally wounding at least two civilians.On Tuesday, the interior minister revealed that an investigation would be launched into violent incidents before and after the announcement of the election results.\"During these attacks, some of the criminals lost their lives,\" he said, without providing a specific number of protesters who have been killed in the clashes.Nji added that several members of the security forces had also sustained serious injuries.Although Nji insisted the situation nationwide was now under control, protesters remain active in some parts of the country, especially in Douala and Garoua, where demonstrators mounted roadblocks on Tuesday, and burnt tyres on the streets.Analysts warn the post-electoral violence could plunge the country into a political crisis.Additional reporting by Natasha Booty and Michel Mvondo",

    "body": "22 hours agoLaura Gozzi,London and Abdujalil Abdurasulov,WarsawRussian troops are making a concerted push in eastern Ukraine and have gained a foothold in the strategic hub of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says. Moscow's soldiers outnumber Kyiv's 8-1 in the area and Ukraine cannot match that, Zelensky added while insisting Russia had not yet \"achieved the planned result\". Russia has been trying to capture Pokrovsk for two years. The key supply and transport hub provides supplies and reinforcements to the eastern front - and it would get Moscow closer to occupying the entirety of the Donetsk region. It would also put towns of the heavily fortified \"fortress belt\" - Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - within easier reach of Moscow. Zelensky said drone imagery showed that around 200 Russian soldiers were inside Pokrovsk. Describing the situation as \"difficult\", he said earlier that there was widespread fierce fighting and \"sabotage groups\" had entered the town. However, he rejected reports by Russia's Chief of General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, that Ukrainian troops had been completely surrounded. In an update on Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry said its forces had encircled Ukrainian troops around the main railway station and cleared the city's Troyanda district of Ukrainian forces.One soldier from Ukraine's 155th Brigade, Artem Pribylnov, rejected the notion that Ukrainian troops had been encircled in a \"cauldron\" at Pokrovsk.\"But the war has changed and it's very technological now,\" he said. In previous assaults there had been a path out of the cauldron that troops could drive in and out of, he said, but now drones controlled access points, which made it \"extremely dangerous\".\"Perhaps that's why Russians claim they've encircled Pokrovsk even if there is no physical encirclement of the city?\" he suggested.According to Capt Hryhoriy Shapoval, spokesperson of Ukraine's East operational group, 79 attacks had been repelled near Pokrovsk since Monday - almost a third of the total 218 assaults recorded across the entire front line.He said that Russian troops had concentrated a large number of troops and equipment near Pokrovsk and that they were using armoured vehicles to cover their infantry. \"So it's hard to stop them,\" he said.He added that Kyiv's troops normally used drones to counter the Russians' advance but foggy and rainy weather conditions had made it harder to detect and destroy infantry troops.The situation in and around Pokrovsk exemplifies the high cost of shifting the front line forward, even just by a few metres. Last week, Ukrainian media reported that Russian forces were engaging in street battles and targeting Ukrainian positions, including drone operators.Away from the towns, drone technology means both Russian and Ukrainian forces are able to pound one another deep on either side of the front line.Russia's full-scale invasion, launched in February 2022, is almost into its fifth year. Moscow's troops currently occupy about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Kyiv's defence capabilities are shrinking and Zelensky has said Ukraine needs  financial support from its European allies to continue fighting Russian forces for another two or three years. European leaders have so far failed to divert €140bn (£123bn) worth of Russian frozen assets to Ukraine - a move which would require complex legal machinations and which was blocked by Belgium at an EU summit last week. The proposal will be revisited in December.Zelensky said he had told his European counterparts that while Ukraine was \"not going to fight for decades... you must show that for some time you will be able to provide stable financial support to Ukraine\".The Ukrainian president also said he hoped a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday would result in a decision by China to cut its support for Russia. Last week Trump slapped Lukoil and Rosneft - two major Russian oil companies - with sanctions, and urged Turkey and China to halt purchases of Russian oil in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin.\"I think this may be one of [Trump's] strong moves, especially if, following this decisive sanctions step, China is ready to reduce imports\" from Russia, Zelensky told journalists earlier this week.",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe co-founder of ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's says that its parent company Unilever blocked it from launching an ice cream flavour that expressed \"solidarity with Palestine\".Ben Cohen announced that he will independently create the new flavour as part of a personal series highlighting causes the company has been barred from addressing publicly.Ben & Jerry's is known for its activism on social issues and has consistently spoken out on political, environmental and humanitarian matters - including the Israel-Gaza conflict.A spokesperson for the Magnum Ice Cream Company, Unilever's ice cream arm, said it had determined that \"now is not the right time to invest in developing this product\". Mr Cohen's statement deepens the long-drawn dispute between the world-famous ice cream maker and Unilever, the British packaged goods giant which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000.The co-founders said Unilever and Magnum, which is in the process of being spun off from its parent company, had unlawfully blocked their company from \"honouring its social mission\".But Magnum said: \"The independent members of Ben & Jerry's Board are not, and have never been, responsible for the Ben & Jerry's commercial strategy and execution.\"It said the company would continue to focus on \"ongoing, impactful campaigns close to its communities\", including campaigning for improved conditions in refugee accommodation in the UK, and freedom of speech rights in the United States.  Mr Cohen said in an Instagram video on Tuesday that he is creating a new watermelon-flavoured sorbet, calling for ideas for the product's name and what ingredients should be added.The watermelon has become a symbol for solidarity with Palestinians due to its colours, which are similar to those of the Palestinian flag – red, green, black and white. The American entrepreneur said Ben & Jerry's were prevented by Unilever from creating the dessert.\"I'm doing what they couldn't,\" Mr Cohen says from his set in a kitchen. \"I'm making a watermelon-flavoured ice cream that calls for permanent peace in Palestine and calls for repairing the damage that was done there.\"In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel. Its Israeli operation was sold by Unilever to a local licensee, allowing its ice cream to continue being sold in the occupied West Bank.The dessert series will be developed under Ben's Best, Mr Cohen's activist ice cream brand, he said in a statement to the press. The flavour is being produced independently of Ben & Jerry's, the statement said.Ben's Best was first setup in 2016 to support former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with the flavour \"Bernie's Back\". Mr Cohen said he will develop other ice cream flavours that speak to the issues Ben & Jerry's was silenced from addressing publicly by Unilever.In September, co-founder Jerry Greenfield stepped down from Ben & Jerry's after decades at the company, citing concerns that its independence had been compromised following Unilever's decision to curb its social activism.At the time, Ben Cohen said that \"Jerry has a really big heart and this conflict with Unilever was breaking it.\"\"My heart leads me to continue to work inside the company to advocate for its independence so that it can actualise the social mission, the values that it was founded on and has maintained for over 40 years,\" he told the BBC's PM programme.",

Residents described the scenes unfolding on Tuesday as \"war-like\", with shoot-outs between officers and armed men - with buses set on fire to create barricades.According to the police, gang members also used drones to drop explosives on the officers as they fanned out through the neighbourhoods, which are strongholds of the Red Command.\"This is how the Rio police are treated by criminals: with bombs dropped by drones. This is the scale of the challenge we face. This is not ordinary crime, but narco-terrorism,\" the governor of Rio state, Cláudio Castro, said. Governor Castro said that the raid had been two months in the planning and was based on a thorough investigation. Among those arrested is a man accused of being a leading drug dealer for the Red Command. The governor also posted photos on social media of the four police officers who were killed in the operation.He praised the officers killed on what he called \"a historic day\" in which he said they \"confronted organised crime\".Rafael Soares, a Brazilian journalist covering crime in Rio, told BBC News Brasil that the Red Command had been on the offensive in Rio in recent years, reclaiming territory it had lost to its rivals, First Capital Command (PCC).Soares added that the police operation was part of Governor Castro's efforts to leave his mark and deal a decisive blow to crime in the city ahead of elections next year. The police raid also comes just days before the city is due to host the C40 World Mayors Summit - a meeting of nearly 100 mayors from the world's leading cities - and the Earthshot Prize - the environmental award which will be handed out by Prince William on 5 November.  Huge police raids are not unusual in Rio, but the number of fatalities in Tuesday's operation is.According to  Soares, police operations in which more than 20 people are killed are \"very rare\" across Brazil and those that do occur, have mainly happened in Rio. Rio de Janeiro's Minister for Public Security, Victor Santos, said that 280,000 people lived in the areas where the raids took place. Police footage showed heavily-armed officers patrolling the narrow, steep lanes of the densely populated hillside favelas.\"This is a war we are seeing in Rio de Janeiro. Decades of inaction by all the institutions - municipal, state and federal - have allowed crime to expand in our territory,\" Santos said.With additional reporting by BBC News Brazil's Marina Rossi and Mariana Alvim in São Paulo.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKoh Ewe,Singapore and Kathryn Armstrong,LondonGetty ImagesThe meeting comes as both countries are still trying to reach a trade dealThe US and South Korea have reached a broad trade deal, both countries have said following talks between their leaders. South Korea's presidential aide, Kim Yong-beom, said the two sides will reduce reciprocal tariffs from 25% to 15%, as was agreed earlier this year. South Korea will also invest $350bn in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding, Kim said. US President Donald Trump, who is currently on a week-long trip in Asia, said the deal was \"pretty much finalised\" at a dinner following the discussions, which lasted almost two hours. He did not give further details. \"We had a tremendous meeting today with South Korea\", Trump said of his discussions with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, adding that \"a lot was determined\".\"We discussed some other things to do with national security et cetera. And I think we came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"Both sides had played down the prospect of a breakthrough ahead of Wednesday's talks - disappointing many in South Korea's electronics, chip and auto industries, which had been hoping for some clarity amidst the tariff chaos. Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which Lee managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn in the US and buy $100bn worth of liquified natural gas.But the White House later increase its demands as part of the trade talks, with Trump pushing for cash investments in the US.Both countries have historically been key allies - but tensions spiked after hundreds of South Koreans were detained in an immigration raid in the US last month.Caught in the middle, South Korea hosts rival superpowersTrump will next meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in on Thursday on the sidelines of a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) which is taking place in Gyeongju.China's foreign ministry has confirmed the meeting, which will take place in the city of Busan on Thursday, a short flight away from Gyeongju. The US president said on Wednesday that he was \"looking forward\" to the meeting.\"We've been talking a lot over the last month and I think we're going to have something that's gonna be very, very satisfactory to China and to us.\"This will be the two leaders' first face to face meeting since Trump assumed office in 2025 and imposed tariffs on every country in the world.Addressing a group of CEOs in Gyeongju on Wednesday, Trump said that he believes the US is \"going to have a deal\" with China and it will be \"a good deal for both\".He also praised the Apec countries for making the global trading system, which he said had been \"broken\" and \"in urgent need of reform\", fairer.\"Economic security is national security,\" Trump says. \"That's for South Korea, that's for any country.\"Golden crowns and grand ordersAhead of Wednesday's talks with President Lee, Trump had been greeted by an honour guard and gifts that included a golden crown. \"I'd like to wear it right now,\" Trump had said of the crown. He also received the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decoration.He's the first US president to receive the award, which was given \"in recognition of his contribution to peace on the Korean Peninsula\", the South Korean presidential office said.Both leaders took part in a working lunch - which was followed by a private meeting in the afternoon. ReutersThe US president was gifted a golden crown and the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decorationTrump's arrival in South Korea had been preceded by North Korea test-firing surface-to-air cruise missiles.The US president had expressed interest in meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but noted on Wednesday that his team had been unable to arrange this during his trip.Noting the long-standing tensions between North and South Korea, Trump said \"we will see what we can do to get that all straightened out\".And outside the summit venue where both leaders were meeting, a small anti-Trump group of protesters gathered on Wednesday afternoon, with some shouting anti-Trump slogans. Police could be seen forcibly dispersing the crowd and arresting some people.However, hundreds more attended a pro-Trump rally - including those who shouted anti-Chinese rhetoric  - that also took place close to the summit venue. Anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea has also grown steadily in recent years. Chinese interference became a common trope in conspiracy theories about former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol.BBC/Leehyun ChoiDozens of people attended a protest outside the Gyeongju National Museum on WednesdayDuring his trip to Japan on Tuesday, the US president signed an agreement on rare earth minerals with Tokyo, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations. This reiterated the commitment of the two countries to implement deals struck earlier, including the 15% tariff deal negotiated earlier this year.Prior to that, he attended a gathering of South East Asian leaders, known as Asean, in Malaysia. There he presided over a \"peace deal\" between Thailand and Cambodia, whose longstanding border dispute erupted into open conflict in July.With additional reporting by Laura Bicker, China Correspondent and Suranjana Tewari, Asia Business Correspondent",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesGeert Wilders is facing a strong challenge from left-leader Frans Timmermans and liberal Rob JettenGeert Wilders' anti-Islam Freedom party is facing a tight race in Wednesday's Dutch election, and even if he wins the vote his hopes of forming a new government appear minimal.Wilders was the clear winner last time Dutch voters went to the polls in November 2023, but final opinion polls ahead of voting suggest a fall in his support.Dutch voters are grappling with a series of crises, from a chronic housing shortage to overcrowded asylum centres. The cost of living is rising with sky-high rents and healthcare costs.Unlike last time, Wilders' rivals are refusing to work with him after he brought down his own coalition government last June.Voting at most of the country's more than 10,000 polling stations continues until 21:00 (20:00 GMT) on Wednesday.Commentators believe it is more important who comes second in the vote than first, as it could decide who will form the next government.Even if Wilders' party comes top, the next Dutch government is more likely to come from the centre left or centre right.The race is wide open, and more than a third of Dutch voters were seen as undecided on the eve of the election.\"It's one of the most important elections, because people need to have their faith restored,\" says Sarah de Lange, professor of Dutch politics at Leiden University.As many as 15 parties are set to win a share of parliament's 150 seats, but opinion polls suggest four will stand out. Apart from Wilders' PVV, there is GreenLeft-Labour under ex-EU top official Frans Timmermans, Rob Jetten's liberal D66 and the centre-right Christian Democrats of Henri Bontenbal.For almost half of Dutch voters, the housing crisis is top priority, with a shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Housing has taken stage in the election, and although Wilders has blamed the crisis on migration, others point to a rise in single-person households and planning gridlock.Most of the parties have vowed to tackle the issue head-on. Frans Timmermans promises at least 100,000 new homes per year if his party takes office, while Rob Jetten of the liberals says the solution lies on building on 1% of agricultural land.Unemployment hit 4% last month, which is low in European terms but the highest rate for four years in the Netherlands. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose 8.8% over the past year, signalling growing anxiety among workers about job security.EPA/ShuttlestockLiberal-conservative leader Dilan Yesilgöz labels Wilders' party \"one man with a Twitter account\"Considered for so long the outsider of Dutch politics, Geert Wilders played a key role in the last government, both in setting it up and in bringing it down after only 11 months, in a row over immigration. His coalition partners refused to let him become prime minister, but having former spy chief Dick Schoof lead a technocrat cabinet was a workaround that ultimately failed.Former coalition partner Dilan Yesilgöz, the leader of the conservative-liberal VVD, told Wilders his \"party exists as one man with a Twitter account and nothing more\".Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesWilders' lead in the polls narrowed in the weeks leading up to the electionYesilgöz's jibe was not completely out of place as Wilders does not allow his PVV to have members. Yesilgöz's own VVD party is polling down in fifth place.Wilders was on the backfoot ahead of the vote, having to apologise to Frans Timmermans after two Freedom party MPs posted AI-generated images of the left-wing leader being led away in handcuffs.When Wilders won two years ago, Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam says he was able to harness the votes of more radical voters on the right who were worried about Islam and Eurosceptic along with less radical voters.\"People called him Milders, a milder version of himself,\" says Prof Rooduijn, who points out that Wilders then put on ice many of his anti-Islam policies to appear more palatable.Although Wilders no longer talks of banning mosques and the Koran, he sees Islam as \"the greatest existential threat to our freedom\", a view Prof Rooduijn describes as \"really a key element of his nativism - an exclusionary form of nationalism\".In one TV debate, Wilders said \"take a walk [in central Rotterdam] on shopping night on Saturday evening and it's like you're in Marrakesh; it's not the Netherlands any more\".Left-wing leader Timmermans has accused him of scapegoating an entire section of society: \"You're blaming Islam.\"But the risk Wilders faces now is of losing both the more radical voters, if they fail to turn out, and the less radical voters who could drift to other parties, including the anti-immigration Ja21.\"Right now I don't think it's very likely Wilders will be part of a government coalition,\" Prof Rooduijn believes.It can take weeks - if not months - for parties to form a coalition, but if the centre right takes power, Christian Democrat Henri Bontenbal could be in the frame to lead it.His CDA party has staged a remarkable comeback in that only two years ago they won just five seats.Bontenbal believes Dutch voters are looking now at a return to \"what I'll call 'boring politics'. The Netherlands is done with populism\".He has not had a great campaign, though. Days after he defended the right of religious schools to teach that homosexual relationships were wrong, he went back on himself and admitted he had made a mistake.",

    "body": "17 hours agoLaura BickerSeoulBBCProtesters gathered in Seoul ahead of Trump's arrival on Wednesday\"No Trump!\" the rally of hundreds shouted, growing louder as it neared the United States embassy in the centre of South Korea's capital Seoul.A line of police buses stopped them reaching the gates, but a stage and loudspeaker ensured their voices would soar above Gwanghwamun square and within earshot of US President Donald Trump's representatives.This was a small rally by the standards of South Korea's vibrant protest culture. And it was not the only one under way. A few hundred metres to the north, at the gates of Gyeongbokgung palace, marchers held aloft more banners as they chanted a very different message.\"No China,\" along with a smattering of \"CCP [Chinese Communist Party] out!\". Again, the numbers - several hundred people - were not huge for South Korea.Nevertheless, this footfall through central Seoul on a sunny Saturday is an indication of the diplomatic dance South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung will have to perform this week as he hosts the leaders of both the US and China.Seoul is - and has long been - a key US ally. A friendship \"forged in blood\", as its leaders often say, during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, when American troops helped repel the North Korean invasion. The South still needs Washington's protection, but it also needs China, its biggest trading partner and a vital market for exports.\"It's a particularly fraught moment - South Korea finds itself caught between a rock and a hard place,\" says Darcie Draudt-Vejares, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\"Year after year it is epitomising the choice of many countries worldwide that are deeply economically integrated with China, but also economically integrated with the US. Right now, Lee Jae-myung is trying to manoeuvre between these superpowers.\"So much so that his country is even hosting talks between Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday that may well yield a breakthrough in their on-again-off-again trade war.A lot on the lineAt 61, Lee is a seasoned politician, but he has his work cut out for him.His emphatic victory in June followed six months of turmoil. His predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law order triggered huge protests and a constitutional crisis that eventually led to his impeachment, but left the country polarised.By the time Lee took office, Trump's tariffs had stunned both allies and rivals. Negotiations began and in August, Lee visited the White House and turned on the charm. It seemed to work.South Korea thought it had appeased its powerful friend. Seoul said it would invest $350bn in the US and buy $100bn worth of liquified natural gas. In return, Trump agreed to lower tariffs from 25% to 15%.Getty ImagesLee Jae Myung with Trump at a meeting in the White House in AugustBut then more than 300 South Koreans were detained in a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in the US state of Georgia. Nearly all of them have since returned, but that has shaken ties - especially because Hyundai is a major investor in the US.\"I don't think the relationship between the US and Korea is necessarily broken at this point,\" said 23-year-old Hye-yeon Lee as the protest outside the US embassy came to an end.\"Although I do think it is being eroded significantly,\" she added.The White House has also increased its demands as part of the trade talks - Trump is now pushing for cash investments in the US. Despite attempts to get a deal signed, there is no final agreement and hopes of reaching one when the two leaders meet on Wednesday are not high.\"South Korea has a huge amount on the line in terms of their prosperity and their security with this visit, but in a funny way, the less time Donald Trump is here could be better for President Lee Jae-myung,\" says John Delury, a senior fellow at the Asia Society's Centre on US-China relations.\"It doesn't look like they're near a breakthrough on their trade agreement. And so, if Trump comes, has his meetings, they go well, and he's out of here in 24 hours, that's not a terrible outcome as far as South Korea is concerned.\"And there is clearly also anger and disillusionment, some of it driven by Trump's contentious personal brand of politics. Hence the protests, where 22-year-old college student Kim Sol-yi was carrying a banner depicting a cartoon Trump vomiting money.\"When he called South Korea a 'money machine' that really angered me,\" she said. \"It seems the US is seeing and treating South Korea as its cash cow – plain and simple – asking for huge investments. Honestly, it makes me pretty mad and question whether the US even thinks of us as an equal partner.\"The protests are not huge by South Korean standardsAnd yet South Koreans' views of the US appear to be largely positive. Nearly nine out of 10 view the US as their most important ally, according to a poll taken earlier this year by the US-based Pew Research Centre. But the survey happened before the raids in Georgia.That poll was not so favourable towards South Korea's other superpower guest this week: China, whom a third of respondents viewed as their country's biggest threat.The China conundrum\"I came out here today out of love for South Korea, to protect South Korea,\" said 27-year-old Park Da-som, who was at the other protest, rallying against China.\"I feel that the Republic of Korea is gradually being overtaken by Chinese influences,\" she adds, but with a pragmatic caveat.\"Of course, I believe we should maintain a certain level of favourable diplomatic relations with China. What we dislike is the CCP - the Chinese Communist Party.\"Anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea has grown steadily since 2016 when Seoul agreed to deploy an advanced US missile defence system in the country, which prompted economic retaliation from a furious Beijing. There are also historic grievances and theirs has always been an uneasy relationship.But the mistrust has intensified on the right in a country divided  by Yoon's impeachment. Chinese interference became a common trope in conspiracy theories about Yoon being a victim of election fraud.While tens of thousands demanded his removal from office, his supporters, far smaller in number but vociferous, opposed his impeachment – even now a fringe group of conservatives regularly call for his return. They are also the ones rallying against China.\"Korea for Koreans\" read the banners at the weekend protests, along with signs calling on the government to \"Stop the Chinese Boats\". One café  is facing criticism after posting online that it would refuse to serve Chinese customers.Such instances have led to allegations of racism but Soo-bin, 27, who was at the protests, disagreed: \"We value democratic freedom and the free market economy. We want a Republic of Korea where all freedom - freedom of association, assembly, religion, expression - are protected. That is why we stand here.\"Anti-Chinese sentiment has been on the rise in South Korea Observers say this is a minority view, represented by a small part of the Korean electorate. Yet it it's hard to deny that there has been a small surge in anti-Chinese rhetoric recently after President Lee eased visa rules for Chinese tourist groups.Lee has tried to curb the protests by introducing a bill banning rallies that promote hatred or discrimination. And long known for his openness to pursue stronger ties with China, he has made it clear that's what he intends to do in office.Xi Jinping is set to meet Lee one-on-one on Saturday during what is his first visit to South Korea in 11 years, despite it being a short hop from Beijing.\"If President Lee can deliver on the economic side, everyone will give him a pass, except for what is ultimately a pretty fringe position on what you could say is the far-right,\" Mr Delury says. \"President Lee is really governing more toward the centre, and the centre of Korea wants to get along with China.\"Hardball with superpowersXi arrives on Thursday and, after meeting Trump, he is spending three days in the ancient capital of Gyeongju with other leaders attending the APEC summit. He is spending more time in South Korea than Trump, which is a huge diplomatic opportunity as he seeks to present China as the more stable trading partner and global power.A better relationship with Beijing – ties soured under Yoon, who was seen as hawkish towards China – could also help President Lee start a conversation with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.This is also a dialogue that he and his Democratic Party have pushed for – the earlier historic summits between Trump and Kim also happened with the help of a South Korean leader from the same party.Could that happen this time? The US president has said he wants to talk, but there has been no reply from Pyongyang.South Korea is one of the world's biggest soft powers at the momentKim aside, this is a big week for South Korea and Lee. It's hard to miss America's influence on the country, from music to religion, but South Korea is now a wealthy, soft-power giant with a voice of its own.The streets bustle with westerners in traditional Korean Hanbok hunting for merchandise from the Netflix hit K-pop Demon Hunters or queuing in K-beauty shops for the hottest new face masks. The economy has been picking up speed again.However Lee chooses to navigate between the world's two biggest economies, it's hard to imagine how he can afford to alienate either.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoDavid Gritten,Jerusalem and Rushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, in IstanbulReutersFour people were killed in an Israeli strike in Nuseirat refugee camp, in central GazaAt least 104 Palestinians were killed in a wave of Israeli strikes in Gaza on Tuesday night, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. The Israeli military said it struck \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\" in response to violations by Hamas of the US-brokered ceasefire deal.Israel's defence minister accused Hamas of an attack in Gaza that killed an Israeli soldier, and of breaching the terms on returning deceased hostages' bodies. Hamas said it had \"no connection\" to the attack and that Israel was trying to undermine the deal.US President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire, but added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.Watch: Explosions seen in Gaza after Netanyahu orders strikesThe Israeli strikes hit homes, schools and residential blocks in Gaza City and Beit Lahia in the north of Gaza, Bureij and Nuseirat in the centre, and Khan Younis in the south.Witnesses in Gaza City described seeing \"pillars of fire and smoke\" rising into the air as explosions shook several residential areas.Gaza's health ministry said a total of 104 people were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, and that more than 250 others were injured.Three women and a man who were pulled from the rubble of the al-Banna family's home in the southern Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency.In the urban Bureij refugee camp, five members of the Abu Sharar family were killed in a strike on their home in the Block 7 area, it said.At Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, women gathered to mourn over the bodies of a mother, Bayan al-Shawaf, and her four children who were killed in a strike on a tent at a camp for displaced families in the al-Mawasi area.\"What kind of world is this? Is this the ceasefire?\" asked Bayan's cousin, Umm Mohammed. \"They [the children] were sleeping. They were wanting to learn.\"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday morning that it had \"begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire\" after carrying out a series of strikes on what it described as \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\", including at least 30 commanders of armed groups.\"The IDF will continue to uphold the ceasefire agreement and will respond firmly to any violation of it,\" it added.A brief statement put out by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Tuesday evening said he had ordered the IDF to carry out \"forceful strikes\" on Gaza but did not specify his reasons.However, his defence minister said Hamas had crossed \"a bright red line\" by launching an attack on Israeli soldiers in Gaza on Tuesday.\"Hamas will pay many times over for attacking the soldiers and for violating the agreement to return the fallen hostages,\" Israel Katz warned.On Wednesday morning, the IDF announced that a reservist soldier, Master Sergeant Yona Efraim Feldbaum, was killed.A military source said the attack took place in the southern city of Rafah on the Israeli side of the so-called \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates IDF-controlled territory inside Gaza under the ceasefire deal.Sgt Feldbaum was killed when one of the vehicles of an IDF engineering team that was dismantling an underground tunnel route in Rafah was hit by fire from \"terrorists in the area\", according to the source.\"A few minutes later, several anti-tank missiles were fired at another armoured vehicle belonging to the troops in the area. No injuries were reported,\" they added.Hamas insisted on Tuesday that it had \"no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah\".On Wednesday, the group stressed that it remained committed to the ceasefire agreement and accused the Israel of seeking to undermine it with the strikes.The US played down concerns that all-out hostilities could resume.On board Air Force One, President Trump told reporters: \"As I understand it, they took out, they killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back and they should hit back.\"\"Nothing is going to jeopardise\" the ceasefire, he said. \"You have to understand Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave.\"UN human rights chief Volker Türk said the reports of so many people being killed were \"appalling\" and urged all sides not to let the opportunity for peace \"slip from our grasp\".On Wednesday afternoon, hours after announcing it had resumed the ceasefire, the IDF said it had carried out a new air strike on a site in the northern town of Beit Lahia where weapons and \"aerial means\" intended for an imminent attack were stored.Palestinian media reported that one person was killed in the al-Salateen area.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians try to clear the rubble of destroyed buildings in Khan Younis, southern GazaOn Tuesday afternoon, Israel's prime minister had pledged to take unspecified \"steps\" against Hamas after the group handed over the previous day a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased hostages still in Gaza.Netanyahu's office said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, an Israeli hostage whose body was recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023, and that this constituted a \"clear violation\" of the ceasefire deal.The IDF also released footage from a drone that it said showed Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" in eastern Gaza City on Monday.\"Shortly afterwards,\" it added, the operatives \"summoned representatives of the Red Cross and staged a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) later condemned what it called the \"fake recovery\", saying it had attended the scene \"at the request of Hamas\" and \"in good faith\".It went on: \"The ICRC team at this location were not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage – in general, our role as neutral intermediary does not include unearthing of the bodies of the deceased. \"Our team only observed what appeared to be the recovery of remains without prior knowledge of the circumstances leading up to it. \"It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.\"ReutersThe Red Cross has been transferring the deceased hostages returned by HamasThe ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey is supposed to implement the first stage of Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan.It said Hamas would return its 48 living and deceased hostages within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect on 10 October.All 20 living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Eleven of the dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.On Saturday, Hamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said the group was facing challenges because Israeli forces had \"altered the terrain of Gaza\". He also said that \"some of those who buried the bodies have been martyred or no longer remember where they buried them\".However, the Israeli government insists Hamas knows the locations of all the bodies.Although the ceasefire deal appeared to acknowledge that Hamas might not be able to return all the deceased hostages within the original timeframe, Trump warned the group on Saturday that it had to hand over those remaining \"quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action\". All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than  68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry.

    "body": "Jamaicans start to reveal devastation as hurricane causes floods, power cuts and splits city in two2 hours agoNick Davis,Kingston and Rachel HaganEPAMany parts of the island have been hit hard - this photo was taken in Kingston on TuesdayThe true extent of Hurricane Melissa is still being revealed in Jamaica.Without power or phone coverage, much of the country is isolated and so information is trickling through.Three-quarters of the country had no electricity overnight, while the numbers of people injured - or perhaps dead - haven't even begun to be counted.Many parts of Jamaica's western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds after the hurricane tore across the island with catastrophic force.As wind and rain lashed through the night, one local official said the destruction resembled \"the scene of an apocalypse movie.\"With communications crippled, the true scale of the disaster remains unknown. Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared the island a \"disaster area\" late Tuesday, warning of \"devastating impacts\" and \"significant damage\" to hospitals, homes and businesses.Although no deaths have yet been confirmed, Montego Bay's mayor Richard Vernon told the BBC his first task at daybreak would be \"to check if everybody is alive.\"Getty ImagesTrees had already been uprooted in St. Catherine before the hurricane made landfall Hurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to strike Jamaica in modern history, barrelled across the country on Tuesday, leaving behind a trail of ruin.At its peak, the hurricane sustained winds of 298 km/h (185 mph) - stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 and killed 1,392 people.Stories of devastation are coming out - people have shared clips of roads that became rivers, mudslides on the hills, roofs being ripped from buildings and palm trees tossed like tooth picks.\"It resembled the scene of an apocalypse movie\", an MP in western Jamaica told Kingston-based journalist Kimone Francis of The Jamaica Gleaner.Francis described the night as \"stressful\" and \"intense\", marked by relentless heavy wind and rain. \"You don't have a connection. You can't speak to the people you normally speak to,\" she told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme.Across Jamaica's central parishes, Francis said, floodwaters rose to the roofs of two-storey homes.One anonymous woman told the BBC: \"There is water coming in through the roof of my house. I am not okay.\"While no fatalities had been confirmed, Jamaica's prime minister told CNN he feared \"there would be some loss of life\". Damage, he said, was widespread - hitting hospitals, schools, homes and businesses.Local government minister Desmond Mckenzie said on Tuesday afternoon that the southwestern parish of St Elizabeth was \"under water\", with at least three families trapped in their homes in the community of Black River. \"Rescue teams are struggling to reach them because of the dangerous conditions\", he said at a news conference.Verna Genus was sheltering from the storm at her four bedroom home in the village of Carlisle, St Elizabeth, when the hurricane ripped the zinc roof off her house.The 73-year-old vegetable farmer was in the house with her sons and baby grandchild when the hurricane made landfall over the area.Verna has lost communications due to the power lines being down. But her UK-based sister, June Powell, spoke to the BBC about what happened.\"She was crying on the phone,\" June said, adding: \"You are huddled up inside and then you look up then the roof is gone. I have never heard her like that - she was wailing 'we are all finished.'\"She is anxiously waiting for the communications networks to be restored so she can talk to her sister.St Elizabeth, known as Jamaica's breadbasket, produces much of the island's produce. With crops submerged and fields destroyed, many farmers will struggle to financially recover. Watch: Floods hit Jamaica as Hurricane Melissa leaves trail of destructionOn the north coast, Montego Bay - the heart of Jamaica's tourism industry and home to its main airport - will also take time to get back on its feet. This hurricane has put a hand around the neck of the Jamaican economy. Montego city was split in two by floodwaters, Mayor Vernon said. He told BBC Breakfast: \"Once the wind subsided, we started to get a lot of heavy rain and that has led to massive floods right across the city. One side of the city is now cut off from the other due to roads being inundated by flood water.\"His immediate concern, he added, was simple: \"Check if everybody is alive.\"In rural Jamaica, the storm has left people shaken. Tamisha Lee, president of the Jamaica Network of Rural Women Producers, said: \"Right now, what I'm seeing is heavy rain, powerful wind, a lot of things flying all over the place, and trees uprooted. There is no electricity. I am feeling anxious and tense. The damage will be enormous.\"Meteorologists said Hurricane Melissa intensified at a speed rarely seen, its rapid strengthening fuelled by abnormally warm Caribbean waters - part of a broader trend linked to climate change.By the time it struck Jamaica, the storm had reached Category 5 strength, with gusts fierce enough to tear roofs from concrete homes, uproot trees and snap power poles. Health officials even issued a crocodile warning, cautioning that floodwaters could drive the reptiles into residential areas.For thousands of tourists caught on the island, the storm brought terror and uncertainty.\"I've never heard anything like it,\" said Pia Chevallier from Cambridge, who travelled to Jamaica with her 15-year-old son on Saturday. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live from her darkened hotel room, she said: \"The glass in the windows and patio doors was all vibrating. The doors sounded like they were slamming, even though they were closed. It was horrendous.\"She added: \"There's debris everywhere - palm trees, coconuts, branches, all over the place. The big palm trees with all the roots are up. That's how strong the winds have been.\"On the north coast, Wayne Gibson, a British tourist from Kent holidaying in Ocho Rios with his wife and two teenage daughters, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that they were sheltering in a communal hall.Kyle Holmes from Bolton, visiting Lucea in the north west, described the hotel as \"a disaster zone\" and said he had no idea when they will be able to get home.Hurricane Melissa had moved on to make landfall in Cuba by early Wednesday morning, leaving Jamaica paralysed and silent. Though it has since weakened to a Category 3 hurricane, it remains powerful with wind speeds of over 200km/h (124mph).Jamaica has a catastrophe bond - a type of insurance for the country - which will hopefully allow people to get back on their feet, but the issue is what's done in the interim.Additional reporting by Gabriela Pomeroy ",

    "body": "5 hours agoIan Aikman and Elettra NeysmithMessages in a bottle written by two Australian soldiers in 1916 have been found more than a century later on the country's south-western coast.The cheerful notes were penned just a few days into their voyage to join the battlefields of France during World War One. One of the soldiers, Pte Malcolm Neville, told his mother that the food on board was \"real good\" and that they were \"as happy as Larry\". Months later, he was killed in action at the age of 28. The other soldier, 37-year-old Pte William Harley, survived the war and returned home.The letters have been passed on to their descendants, who have been stunned by the discovery.The bottle was found earlier this month on the remote Wharton Beach, near Esperance in Western Australia, by local resident Deb Brown and her family.She was visiting the beach with her husband and daughter on one of their regular quad bike trips to clear up litter, when they spotted a thick glass bottle in the sand, she said on Tuesday.\"We do a lot of cleaning up on our beaches and so would never go past a piece of rubbish. So this little bottle was lying there waiting to be picked up,\" Ms Brown told the Associated Press news agency.Though the paper was wet, both letters were still legible, so Ms Brown began tracking down the soldiers' families in order to pass them on.Ms Brown located Pte Neville's great-nephew, Herbie Neville, by searching for the soldier's name and the town he was from online, as his mother's address was included in the note.Mr Neville told ABC News the experience had been \"unbelievable\" for his family, especially for Marian Davies - Pte Neville's niece - who remembers her uncle leaving to go to war and never returning.The second letter, written by Pte William Harley, was addressed simply to whoever found the bottle. His mother had died years earlier.Pte Harley's granddaughter, Ann Turner, told ABC she and the soldier's four other surviving grandchildren were \"absolutely stunned\" by the message.\"It really does feel like a miracle and we do very much feel like our grandfather has reached out for us from the grave,\" she said.\"I feel very emotional when I see that the other young man had a mother to write to, and that message in the bottle was to his mother, whereas our grandfather long ago had lost his mother so he just writes it to the finder of the bottle.\"The bottle was thrown overboard \"somewhere in the Bight\", Pte Harley's letter said, referring to the Great Australian Bight off the country's southern coast.An oceanography professor told ABC it may only have been in the water for a few weeks before it landed at Wharton Beach, where it may have remained buried for 100 years.",

    "body": "Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has said the US revoked his visa and banned him from the country. The 91-year-old author, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, said the US consulate asked him to bring in his passport so his visa could be cancelled in person as new unspecified information had come to light.Soyinka called the invitation a \"rather curious love letter from an embassy\" in a news conference held on Tuesday and told organisations hoping to invite him to the US \"not to waste their time\".The US embassy in Nigeria has said it cannot comment on individual cases.The Nobel laureate has previously held permanent residency in the US but renounced it in 2016, tearing up his green card in protest of President Donald Trump's election.The green card is a permanent residence permit for the US - prized by many African immigrants to the US.Soyinka affirmed on Tuesday that he no longer had his green card – and jokingly added that it had \"fallen between the fingers of a pair of scissors and it got cut into a couple of pieces\". The famed author has had regular teaching engagements at US universities for the past 30 years.\"I have no visa. I am banned,\" he said on Tuesday.Soyinka has long been critical of the Trump administration's radical stance on immigration and linked the visa revocation to his outspoken criticism.He said his recent comparison of Trump to Uganda's dictator - \"Idi Amin in white face\" - may have contributed to the current situation.\"When I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment,\" Soyinka said, \"he's been behaving like a dictator.\" Idi Amin was a Ugandan military officer and dictator who ruled the country from 1971 to 1979, infamous for his brutal regime and widespread human rights abuses.When asked if he would consider going back to the US, Soyinka said: \"How old am I?\"In July, the US State Department announced sweeping changes to its non-immigrant visa policy for citizens of Nigeria and several other African countries.According to the policy, nearly all non-immigrant and non-diplomatic visas issued to Nigerians and nationals of Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ghana would now be single-entry and valid for only three months, rolling back the up to five-year, multiple-entry visas they had enjoyed previously.",

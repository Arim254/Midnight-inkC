    "body": "5 hours agoJerome Wirawan,in Indonesia, and Aleks PhillipsReutersMore than 50 people have been injured in explosions during Friday prayers at a mosque in Indonesia, with authorities identifying a 17-year-old student as the suspected perpetrator. The incident happened at around 12:15 local time (05:15 GMT) inside a school complex that housed the mosque in Kelapa Gading - a district in the capital, Jakarta. The victims, mostly pupils, sustained a range of injuries, including severe burns. The suspect was also hurt, according to Indonesia's police chief, Listyo Sigit Prabowo. He added that an investigation into the incident is under way, \"including how the suspect assembled and carried out the attack\". A bomb disposal team was deployed to the state-run high school complex following the explosions to collect evidence and ensure there were no other explosive devices.A pupil at the school alleged to Indonesia's government-owned news agency Antara that a homemade bomb had been brought in by a student who had often been bullied by other students.Other pupils told Indonesian news outlets that the suspect was a \"loner\" who often made drawings depicting violence, and who had been found lying on the ground following the explosion.A cook at the school described seeing white smoke coming from the mosque and broken windows after the \"massive\" blast.\"Our hearts were beating fast, we couldn't breathe,\" she told the Reuters news agency.A high-ranking Jakarta Metropolitan Police officer confirmed the presence of two objects resembling firearms at the scene.Images from Antara suggest one of the objects appeared to be a submachine gun and another looked like a pistol.The submachine gun-type object appears to be inscribed on its barrel with: \"14 words. For Agartha.\"On its body, it says: \"Brenton Tarrant. Welcome to Hell.\"Brenton Tarrant is the perpetrator of a 2019 mass shooting at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 51 and injured dozens of others.A minister who visited the scene later on Friday sought to dispel suggestions that weapons were present at the site, telling CNN Indonesia what had been pictured \"turned out to be a toy gun, not a real gun\".Lodewijk Freidrich Paulus also called on the public not to presume the explosion was a \"terrorist act\" as investigators were still combing over the scene.Another object found at the site was a dark green belt for storing gun cartridges.Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population.",

    "body": "EU forces free crew after Somali pirate attack on tanker 2 hours agoRachel HaganEuropean Union Naval ForceThe Hellas Aphrodite was seized by pirates on ThursdayEuropean Union naval forces have rescued 24 sailors from a Maltese-flagged oil tanker that was attacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia.The Hellas Aphrodite, carrying petrol from India to South Africa, was seized on Thursday when armed pirates opened fire with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades before boarding the vessel. The crew locked themselves inside a fortified citadel while the attackers took control of the ship.A Spanish warship, the ESPS Victoria, operating under the EU's anti-piracy mission Operation Atalanta, reached the tanker on Friday afternoon. Special forces boarded the vessel and found all 24 crew members unharmed.\"The crew is safe and no injuries have been reported. Throughout the incident, they remained in the citadel in direct contact with Atalanta,\" the EU mission said, adding that a \"show of force\" had prompted the pirates to abandon the ship before the warship arrived.It added that the threat risk in the area \"remains critical\" as the pirates are still in the area. The rescue operation involved a helicopter, drone and surveillance aircraft. Just hours earlier, another ship in the same area was approached by a small speedboat but managed to evade it.It is the latest in a spate of attacks that have created concern about a resurgence of piracy in the area. Such activity had declined when international naval patrols and security measures were introduced after peaking more than a decade ago.However, attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea, which have been carried out for the past two years, have led vessels to be diverted through East Africa's Indian Ocean - creating new opportunities for Somali gangs.There were seven reported incidents of piracy that took place off the coast of Somalia last year, according to the International Maritime Bureau - including three hijackings. It reported only one incident of piracy in 2023. ",

    "body": "41 minutes agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Manjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

    "body": "France has advised its citizens in Mali to leave as soon as possible, as Islamist insurgents continue their blockade of the country.The French foreign ministry advised citizens to depart on commercial flights while they are still available, and to avoid overland travel.A two-month-old fuel blockade on Mali, imposed by al-Qaeda-affiliated group has upended daily life in the capital, Bamako, and other regions of the landlocked West African country - a former French colony.France's announcement came as MSC - the world's biggest shipping company - said it was halting its operations in Mali, citing the blockade and deteriorating security.The jihadist group Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) has caused the obstruction by attacking tankers on major highways.Mali has no coast so all fuel supplies are brought in by road from neighbouring states such as Senegal and Ivory Coast.Last month, the US embassy in Bamako announced that non-essential diplomatic staff and their families would leave Mali amid the crisis.It said the fuel disruptions had affected the supply of electricity and had the \"potential to disrupt the overall security situation in unpredictable ways\".Mali is currently ruled by a military junta led by Gen Assimi Goïta, who first seized power in a coup in 2020.The junta had popular support when it took power, promising to deal with the long-running security crisis prompted by a separatist rebellion in the north by ethnic Tuaregs, which was then hijacked by Islamist militants.The UN peacekeeping mission and French forces had been deployed in 2013 to deal with the escalating insurgency.Both have left since the junta took over, and the military government has hired Russian mercenaries to tackle the insecurity.However, the jihadist insurgency has continued and large parts of the north and east of the country remain outside government control.",

    "body": "A former Israeli hostage who was released last month has told Israeli TV that he was sexually assaulted during his two years in captivity in Gaza.In an interview with Channel 13's Hazinor programme, Rom Braslavski, 21, described being stripped naked and tied up by members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).\"It was sexual violence, and its main purpose was humiliation. Its goal was to humiliate me, to crush my dignity,\" he said.He is the first man held hostage to allege publicly that he was sexually assaulted.Warning: This article contains details some readers may find disturbing.Rom Braslavski was on leave from his service as a soldier in the Israeli military and was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival when Hamas and allied Palestinian armed groups attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages.Israel responded to the attacks by launching a military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 68,800 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Four weeks ago, Mr Braslavski was among the last 20 living Israeli hostages who were released under a US-brokered ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.In the interview with Channel 13, broadcast late on Thursday, Mr Braslavski said his treatment by PIJ deteriorated rapidly after he had refused to convert from Judaism to Islam in March this year, which was also when the previous ceasefire collapsed.He said he was kept blindfolded for three weeks, had stones pushed into his ears to limit his hearing, and had his rations of food and water reduced.Then, he added, his captors received what they described as an order to torture him.Mr Braslavski said they tied him up, punched him, and whipped him with a metal cable – and that this was repeated several times a day.\"I entered into a loop, which I doubted I would come out of alive,\" he recalled.In August 2025, PIJ posted a video in which Mr Braslavski was seen crying and saying that he had run out of food and water, was unable to stand or walk, and was \"at death's door\".Following the publication of the video, Mr Braslavski told Channel 13, his captors also began to sexually assault him.\"They stripped me of all my clothes, my underwear, everything. They tied me up from the... When I was completely naked I was wiped out, dying without food and I prayed to God: 'Save me, get me out of this already',\" he said.When asked whether his captors did \"more things like that\", Mr Braslavski replied: \"Yes. It's hard for me to talk about this part specifically. I don't like to talk about it. And it's hard. It was a horrific thing.\"He added: \"You just pray to God for it to stop. And while I was there, every day, every beating, every day, I'd say to myself: 'I survived another day in hell. Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up to another hell. And another hell'.\"Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Mr Braslavski had shown \"extraordinary courage in sharing the horrors of his captivity, including a horrific sexual assault he endured\".\"The world must understand the scale of the crimes committed by the terrorists in Gaza, heinous cruelty, sexual violence, and abuse,\" he wrote on X.At least four women held as hostages have spoken publicly about alleged incidents of sexual abuse against themselves or fellow captives, according to Reuters.A PIJ official told Reuters news agency that Mr Braslavski's allegation of sexual assault was \"incorrect\", without elaborating.The UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict said in March 2024 that she and a team of experts had found \"convincing information\" of rape and sexualised torture being committed against some hostages in Gaza. They also found reasonable grounds to believe that sexual violence occurred in multiple locations, including rape and gang rape, during the 7 October attacks. Hamas said the report's findings were \"baseless\".A separate report by a UN commission of inquiry in March 2025 concluded that Israel had \"increasingly employed sexual, reproductive and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians\", including \"forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, as well as sexual assault\". Israel called the allegations \"unfounded\".Last week, the former top lawyer in the Israeli military resigned after saying she was responsible for the leaking of a video that purportedly shows soldiers abusing a Palestinian detainee at a base in Israel last year. The detainee was treated for severe injuries after allegedly being stabbed in the rectum. Five soldiers have been charged over the incident.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames WaterhouseEurope correspondentThe Belgian government has told the BBC it is urgently trying to acquire drone defences after a sighting forced its main airport near Brussels to close temporarily.Flights were paused at Zaventem airport on Thursday night, after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Defence Minister Theo Francken said. \"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Francken said several European allies have offered assistance, and he had accepted help from the German military which is providing anti-drone defences.About 3,000 passengers of Brussels Airlines were affected by the disruptions, and the carrier said it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.\"EU compensation schemes don't apply here,\" Joelle Neeb of Brussels Airlines told the BBC. \"But we do have an obligation to make sure passengers get to their final destination as soon as possible by offering refunds of alternative flights, as well as covering their hotels and transport.\"She added that drones were a \"new threat\" and as such, the airline was adapting its contingency plans.\"When our main airport is closed even for just 30 minutes, that has a big impact and we need to act fast.\"Drone sightings have caused major flight disruptions across Europe in recent months, including in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.Some officials have blamed \"hybrid warfare\" by Russia, but the Kremlin has denied it has anything to do with it.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius also alleges Moscow's involvement, suggesting these latest sightings could be linked to European Union discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.The controversial plan would see Kyiv receive a €140bn loan, but with the money being held in a Belgium-based bank, Euroclear. Brussels is nervous that it could be legally forced to pay Moscow back once the war in Ukraine ends.Belgian security services also suspect Russia, but Francken admits there is currently no accompanying evidence.In fact, amongst all the European finger pointing, there is no public proof suggesting Russia is responsible for these disruptions.Suspicions are nevertheless being fuelled by more serious airspace incursions that Moscow has recently carried out in Eastern Europe, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones.The Kremlin's likely goals are to both test European defences, as well as try to distract the bloc from supporting Ukraine, which is still on the receiving end of its invasion.Additional reporting by Bruno Boelpaep.",

    "body": "12 hours agoLaura BickerChina correspondentChina's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third aircraft carrier, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds.Its entry into active duty marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships.  China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up.The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong.State media hailed the Fujian as a \"major milestone\" in the development of China's navy.The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian.The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea.State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: \"Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!\"",

    "body": "Typhoon which killed almost 200 in Philippines and Vietnam weakens15 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Sen NguyenWatch: Typhoon Kalmaegi barrels through central VietnamTyphoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 188 people in the Philippines and five in Vietnam, according to the latest figures from the two countries.The storm is now headed west to Cambodia and Laos after it barrelled through central Vietnam on Thursday with winds of up to 149km/h (92mph).Towns along Vietnam's central coast were littered with debris this morning after taking the full brunt of the storm overnight. The strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. Thousands of people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings as the army was deployed to help deal with the damage. Vietnamese authorities have warned of possible flooding in low-lying areas. Central Vietnam has already seen record rainfall in the past week which has killed 50 people.Earlier this week the same storm devastated parts of the Philippines when heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods. The death toll reported on Friday was a jump from the 114 reported the previous day. Another 135 people are listed as missing. The Philippines government has declared a state of calamity across the country as it prepares for another typhoon which is building up in the Pacific Ocean.Ahead of Typhoon Kalmaegi, Vietnam's military on Thursday deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel for relief efforts, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and six aircraft. Some airports and expressways in the country were closed and hundreds of thousands were evacuated.Shortly after the typhoon made landfall at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT), hundreds of residents in Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported.Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.Many people said their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area.AFP via Getty ImagesTrees came down in high winds near Quy Nhon beach in Gia Lai, central Vietnam, as Kalmaegi approached on ThursdayAccording to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response.\"We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,\" he was quoted as saying.\"No one should be left hungry or cold.\" Before making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines.At least 188 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month's worth of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier.In Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction, Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home.\"We don't have any home anymore,\" she told the BBC. \"We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. \"We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different.\"Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.EPAPeople have been sheltering in evacuation centres after flooding destroyed homes in Cebu, Philippines this week",

    "body": "7 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,Nairobi and Mayeni Jones,PretoriaExplosions have been heard near the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said it would agree to a humanitarian ceasefire.Residents in Khartoum, which is controlled by the army, told the AFP news agency that they were woken overnight by the sound of drones and explosions.The blasts appeared to take place near a military base and a power station in the early hours of Friday morning, the residents said.The RSF has not addressed these accounts, but Sudan's military-led government said it would be wary of agreeing to a truce as the group did not \"respect\" ceasefires.The two sides have been embroiled in a civil war that has killed at least 150,000 people and forced 12 million others from their homes since it erupted in April 2023.This week a UN-backed global hunger monitor confirmed that famine conditions were spreading in conflict zones.On Friday, drones were heard not only in Khartoum, but also 300km (186 miles) north of the city, in the military-controlled town of Atbara.\"Anti-aircraft defences shot them down, but I saw fires breaking out and heard sounds of explosions in the east of the city,\" a resident there told AFP.The day before, the RSF announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by the US, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Egypt.The four countries put forward the plan in September - and said it should be followed by a permanent ceasefire and a transition to civilian rule.At the time the Sudanese government rejected \"foreign interference\" and any attempts that equated it with a \"racist terrorist militia that relies on foreign mercenaries\".It is not clear if the proposal has been modified since then.But during a press conference on Friday, Sudan's ambassador to South Africa said it was too early for his country to agree to the plan.\"From our experience, we had many truces at the beginning of the war but every time there was no respect from [the RSF],\" Osman Abufatima Adam Mohammed said.\"They use these truces to move to new areas and make moves against the government.\"The ambassador opposed the UAE's presence at the ceasefire talks, repeating his government's allegation that the Gulf nation was supplying the RSF with weapons and foreign fighters.UN experts say accusations of such military support are credible, but the UAE has denied all involvement with the RSF.The RSF and the military have agreed to ceasefire proposals before, but none have stuck.This time, the RSF waited until it had finally seized el-Fasher, a key city that it had been blockading for 18 months, before announcing it was on board with the truce.Now that the paramilitary group has consolidated control over el-Fasher and, consequently, the vast wider western region of Darfur, it may have greater leverage in future ceasefire negotiations.But the RSF is also facing an international backlash against widespread reports of mass killings and sexual violence during the fall of el-Fasher, which it has denied.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHumphrey Mgonja,BBC Africa, Dar es Salaam and Wycliffe MuiaA Tanzanian court has charged at least 240 people with treason following last week's deadly election protests.President Samia Suluhu Hassan was declared the winner of the election with 98% of the vote, but the opposition - which was barred from contesting - denounced the poll as a sham.Security forces clashed with those protesting against the vote and, according to various sources, hundreds were killed. The authorities have downplayed the scale of the violence and maintained the election was free and fair.Many people were arrested and have now been charged with treason at a court in the economic capital of Dar es Salaam. They were not been asked to enter a plea in court.According to a charge sheet seen by the BBC, the defendants are accused of inciting demonstrations with the intention of obstructing the election.The defendants could receive the death penalty if found guilty. However, in Tanzania, the majority of those sentenced to death eventually have their sentence commuted to life in jail.The East African nation's last execution took place in the 1990s.Among those charged on Friday was prominent Tanzanian businesswoman Jenifer Jovin. She has been accused of encouraging protesters to buy gas masks in order to protect themselves from the police's tear gas.The defendants also include social media influencers. The court has been adjourned until 19 November. During her inauguration speech, President Samia condemned the violence and also blamed foreigners for stoking the unrest.It has left many Kenyans in Tanzania fearful for their safety after being reportedly targeted in the brutal crackdown - and has prompted Kenya's Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi to ask his Tanzanian counterpart that their safety be guaranteed.During a phone conversation, Mudavadi said he had told his Tanzanian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo that concerns would be \"addressed through the established diplomatic and consular channels\".But he reaffirmed \"the importance of safeguarding the rights, safety, and dignity\" of Kenyans living in Tanzania.In May, Mudavadi had said that about 250,000 Kenyans lived, worked or did business in Tanzania.Earlier a Tanzanian police spokesman said the country had intelligence that some foreigners had crossed the border through illegal points \"with the intention to commit crimes, including causing unrest\".Several families in Kenya have expressed concern for the safety of their relatives in Tanzania, following reports that some Kenyans have been killed, injured, or detained, while others are nursing injuries allegedly inflicted by Tanzanian security officers.John Ogutu, a Kenyan teacher working in Dar es Salaam, was shot dead by police while on his way to buy food, his older sister told the BBC.But rights groups say his body can not be traced for repatriation and burial.On Tuesday, a doctor at Muhimbili Hospital in Dar es Salaam told the BBC that vehicles marked \"Municipal Burial Services\" had been collecting bodies of those believed to have died in the protests.Kenya's foreign affairs ministry has now asked relatives of Kenyans who may be in distress in Tanzania to share their names, addresses and emergency contacts.Reports say many Kenyans, especially those working in private schools, are now fleeing Tanzania after the government warned employers not to engage people without work permits.Election observers say the polls fell short of democratic standards, but the government insists the election was fair and transparent.President Samia faced little opposition with key rival candidates either imprisoned or barred from running.Her inauguration ceremony was held at a military parade ground in the capital, Dodoma, instead of a stadium as in previous years. It was closed to the public but was shown live on state TV.She initially came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli - and was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed.Tanzania and Kenya, which are both part of the Economic African Community, have experienced periodic political and economic tensions.In May diplomatic relations were strained over Tanzania's treatment of Kenyans who had gone to Dar es Salaam to observe the treason trial of opposition leader Tundu Lissu.Several of them were deported while prominent Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi, along with Ugandan activist Agather Atuhaire, went missing and were later reported to have been tortured and sexually mistreated.",

    "body": "'I thought it was a prank' - How a Brazilian woman became the face of India vote fraud row10 hours agoLuiz Fernando Toledo in London and Geeta Pandey & Yogita Limaye in IndiaBBC NewsCongress PartyLarissa Nery has found herself at the centre of a storm since Rahul Gandhi's press conference on WednesdayA Brazilian hairdresser Larissa Nery, who has been making headlines in India this week after her photograph was splashed over the news in an allegation about alleged election fraud, has told the BBC she initially thought it was all a mistake. Or a prank.But then her social media blew up and people started tagging her on Instagram.\"At first it was a few random messages. I thought they were mistaking me for someone else,\" she told the BBC. \"Then they sent me the video where my face appeared on a big screen. I thought it was AI or some joke. But then lots of people started messaging at the same time and I realised it was real.\"Nery, who lives in Belo Horizonte, capital city of southeastern Brazil's Minas Gerais state, and has never been to India, says she searched on Google to understand what was going on.What had happened was the fallout of a press conference by Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday where he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party BJP and the Election Commission (EC) of committing voter fraud in last year's election in Haryana state. The BJP has denied the allegations. Hours after the press conference, in a post on X, the Chief Electoral Officer of Haryana shared a letter they said they had sent to Gandhi in August asking him to sign an oath with the names of ineligible voters \"so that necessary proceedings could be initiated\". They did not respond to the specific allegations he made and did not comment on Nery's case. The BBC has reached out to the poll panel for response.Gandhi has made a series of accusations of \"vote theft\" against the poll panel since early August.In his latest claims, he said his team had looked through the Election Commission's voter list data and found that of the approximately 20 million voters, 2.5 million were irregular entries - including duplicates, bulk voters and invalid addresses. He blamed his party's loss in the Haryana election on this alleged manipulation of the voters' list.To prove his claims, he showed a number of slides on a big screen. One of them showed Gandhi standing in front of a big image of Nery, while another showed a compilation of 22 voters with different names and addresses but all with her photos.BBC speaks to Larissa Nery\"Who is this lady? How old is she? She votes 22 times in Haryana,\" Gandhi said.He explained that a single stock photo of a woman, taken by Brazilian photographer Matheus Ferrero, had been used repeatedly across multiple voter entries under different names. He described Nery as a model who had appeared on the voters' list under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati.The 29-year-old confirmed to the BBC that it was indeed her in the photograph. \"Yes. It is me. Much younger, but it is me. I am the person in the images.\" She clarified that she was a hairdresser and not a model and that the photo was taken in March 2017 when she was 21, just outside her home. The photographer, she said, \"thought I was pretty and asked to take photos of me\".Now years later, all the attention in the past two days from \"people from India, many of them journalists\", has left her scared.\"I became scared. I cannot tell if it is dangerous for me or if speaking about it could harm someone there. I do not know who is right or wrong because I do not know the parties involved,\" she said.\"I did not go to work in the morning because I could not even see messages from my clients. Many journalists were calling me. They found the number of the place where I work. \"I had to remove the salon name from my profile because they were disturbing my workplace. My boss even spoke to me. Some people treat it like a meme, but it is affecting me professionally.\"Matheus Ferrero, who took Nery's photo, is also overwhelmed by the sudden attention. Until recently, he says India meant only Caminho das Índias - the 2009 Brazilian primetime show - to him.He's still trying to make sense of the events of the last few days in a country thousands of miles away.Some people had reached out to him from India a week back, asking him who the woman in the photo was, he told the BBC.\"I didn't reply. I'm not going to give someone's name like that. And I hadn't seen this friend in years,\" he told the BBC. \"I thought it was a scam. I blocked and reported it.\"But since Gandhi's press conference, \"things have exploded\".Congress PartyGandhi said Nery had appeared on the voters' list in Haryana under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati\"People were calling me on Instagram and Facebook. It was terrible. I deactivated my Instagram to try to understand what was going on. Later I googled it and realised what was happening, but at first I had no idea.\"Ferrero says some websites put his pictures next to the Nery's photo without permission. \"People were making memes, like turning it into a game show joke. It's absurd.\"In 2017, Ferrero was just starting out as a photographer when he invited Nery, who he knew, to come out for a photoshoot. Ferrero said he shared the photos on his Facebook and also posted them on Unsplash - a photo website - with her consent.\"The photo blew up… reached around 57 million views,\" he said.He has now deleted the link from his Unsplash account but he sent us screenshots taken earlier that showed other photos of Nery from the same shoot.Why India's Election Commission is facing a test of credibility  \"I deleted them out of fear, because the photos were being misused. I got scared imagining this happening to other people I photographed. I felt invaded. A lot of random people coming at me. You think 'Did I do something wrong?' But I didn't. The platform was open and I uploaded like millions of others.\" He's also now made the original Facebook post with her photos private.\"When you see people entering your Twitter, Facebook, personal Instagram, you panic. The first reaction is to shut everything down and understand later. Some people thought it was funny, like a soap opera, but I felt invaded.\"Neither Ferrero nor Nery have ever been to India and are still trying to understand how something that happened at the other end of the world could turn their lives upside down.We asked Ferrero if all this helped uncover electoral fraud, would that be positive?\"Yes, I think that would be positive. But I don't really know the details,\" he said.Nery who has never left the country says: \"This is far from my reality. I do not even follow elections in Brazil, let alone in another country.\"",

    "body": "COP30: World leaders take aim at Trump for climate inaction1 day agoEsme Stallard,Climate and science reporter, BBC News and Matt McGrath,Environment correspondent, BBC NewsPablo Porciuncula/AFPBrazilian President Lula warned of \"extremist forces\" when he addressed world leaders at the global climate summitUS President Donald Trump has been criticised by world leaders for his stance on climate change, ahead of the global COP30 summit.President Trump, who is not attending the meeting in the Amazonian city of Belém, was called a liar by the leaders of Colombia and Chile for his rejection of climate science.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the waning political support on climate change. He said it had been a unity issue internationally and in the UK but \"today sadly that consensus is gone\".Over the next two weeks countries will try and negotiate a new deal on climate change, with a particular focus on channelling more money to forest protection.Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit.And while Trump isn't attending this meeting in Belém, his views on climate change are certainly on the minds of many of the other leaders present.Speaking at the UN in September, the US president said that climate change was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\".He said: \"The entire globalist concept, asking successful industrialised nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies, must be rejected completely and totally.\"Without naming the US leader, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil warned on Thursday of \"extremist forces that fabricate fake news and are condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming\".The leaders of Chile and Colombia went further, calling the US president a liar, and asking other countries to ignore US efforts to move away from climate action.Maisa Rojas, Chile's environment minister, told the BBC: \"The science is very clear. It is very important not to falsify the truth.\"But while Trump-bashing went down well with the audience, getting agreement on new steps to tackle warming is proving much harder.Only a few dozen leaders have turned up here in Belém, and a majority of countries have failed to submit new plans to cut carbon emissions, the root cause of rising temperatures.AFP via Getty ImagesOuteiro Port in Belém was recently expanded to accommodate cruise ships acting as \"floating hotels\" for COP30 delegatesDespite Starmer acknowledging that global political support for the climate movement is waning, he told the gathering of those that were present: \"My message is that the UK is all-in.\"However, on Wednesday night, in a blow to the Brazilian hosts, the UK chose to opt out of its flagship $125bn (£95bn) fund to support the world's rainforests.President Lula hoped that $25bn could be raised for the Tropical Forests Forever Facility from public sources – mainly from developed countries like the UK – to support governments and communities protecting the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin.The protection of these ecosystems is crucial for tackling climate change - they cover just 6% of the world's land, yet store billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases and host half of the planet's species.The move by the UK has come as a surprise as it had been heavily involved in the fund's design, and launched a global commitment for countries to halt deforestation by 2030 when it hosted the COP summit in Glasgow in 2021.Lord Zach Goldsmith, who worked on the issue when he was environment minister, told the BBC's PM programme: \"The assumption was that the UK would be a leading participant and at the last minute the UK has walked away.

    "body": "24 minutes agoSwaibu IbrahimBBC AfricaAFP via Getty ImagesJoseph Kony's rebel group gained notoriety for hacking off the limbs of peopleSurvivors of the reign of terror inflicted by Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels in Uganda have told the BBC they welcome the move by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to confirm charges against the group's leader Joseph Kony.An arrest warrant was issued for him in 2005, but he remains at large - believed to be hiding in the Central African Republic (CAR).On Thursday, the ICC said he was being charged with 39 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, using child soldiers, sexual slavery and forced pregnancy.A woman abducted by the LRA as a child and forced to become one of Kony's wives said she hoped the move would renew efforts to capture him.\"I cannot be happy like other women who went to school. I need justice for women who went through abduction like me,\" Evelyn Amon, 42, told the BBC.Evelyn Amon says victims cannot get compensation until Kony is triedShe spent 11 years in the bush with the LRA after being abducted from her home at age 11 - and she said she even forgot her own name as the rebels called her Betty Achol.Ms Amon said victims like her wanted him to be tried so they could get compensation from the court.Kony's ICC trial cannot begin unless he is arrested and present in court in The Hague.The LRA was formed by Kony in the late 1980s in northern Uganda, where it said its goal was to install a government based on the biblical Ten Commandments.The group, which was notorious for hacking off its victims' limbs or parts of their faces and taking sex slaves, was eventually forced out of the country in 2005.It moved to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo and was also active in South Sudan and the CAR, where remnants of the rebels are understood to have engaged in poaching and illegal mining.Kony's notoriety increased in 2012 because of a social media campaign to highlight the LRA's alleged atrocities. The following year, the US offered a $5m (£3.8m) reward for information leading to his arrest.Despite those efforts, and years of manhunts, he remains a fugitive - and the US and Ugandan armies officially ended their operations to track him down in 2017.Twenty-eight-year-old Patrick Ochieng, who was born in LRA captivity after his mother was abducted and sexually assaulted, also hopes the confirmation of charges will lead to Kony's capture.\"He should first be arrested. The victims who suffered can't wait - some of these victims are already dying,\" Mr Ochieng told the BBC.\"We grew up in the rebel barracks, deep in the forest,\" he said.He is among thousands of children who were forced to become child soldiers. His mother was killed by the rebels when he just five years old.\"She tried to escape with us - me and my twin sister - but the policy was clear: if you try to escape and you're caught, they [must] finish you. They'll kill you,\" the visibly emotional young man said.Over nearly two decades in northern Uganda during the LRA insurgency more than 100,000 people were killed, between 60,000 and 100,000 children were abducted and 2.5 million people fled their homes - many moving into camps for better protection.Muhammad Olanya was 17 when a camp in the village of Lukodi was attacked by LRA rebels in 2004 - 70 people were killedBut these also came under attack, like one in the village of Lukodi, just a few kilometres from the town of Gulu. More than 70 people, including women and children, were killed there in 2004.Muhammad Olanya, who was 17 at the time, still remembers that night vividly.\"We heard strange sounds like drumbeats followed by whistles - those were bullets,\" he told the BBC.\"I ran, but by the time I reached the market, I was exhausted. I sat down by the roadside.\"He was lucky not to be abducted as he was rescued by a Ugandan army officer.But he says the conflict devastated his life - he lost relatives and got no formal education. There were attempts by the Ugandan government to strike a peace deal with Kony, but talks fell apart in 2008 because the LRA leader wanted assurances that he and his allies would not be prosecuted.The victims hope the ICC's decision to press forward with the confirmation of charges without him present means the LRA leader will one day be held accountable.More BBC stories on the LRA:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

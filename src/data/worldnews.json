    "body": "<div><p>The US Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by Ghislaine Maxwell against her sex-trafficking conviction.</p><p>Without providing an explanation, the court declined to hear the former British socialite's appeal, which means her 20-year sentence will remain in place barring a presidential pardon. </p><p>Her lawyer, David Oscar Markus, told the BBC her team was \"deeply disappointed\", but would continue exploring legal avenues \"to ensure that justice is done\".</p><p>Maxwell was convicted for her role in luring underage girls for her former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein to exploit. Epstein died in prison in 2019.</p></div><div><p>Family members of Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre told the BBC they were grateful for the court's denial and committed to ensuring she served her full sentence. </p><p>The justice department did not immediately comment.</p><p>She was recently interviewed by federal agents in the US about what she knew as part of an inquiry into the sex-trafficking scheme and whether others could have been involved. </p><p>She was found guilty in 2021 of facilitating Epstein's abuse. Prosecutors said she recruited and groomed the girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein, a New York financier.</p><p>Maxwell's lawyers appealed against the verdict, arguing she should never have been tried or convicted for her role in the scheme.</p><p>Speculation has been rife that Trump could pardon Maxwell. The White House has previously said \"no leniency is being given or discussed\" <b> </b>- a sentiment it reiterated on Monday. </p><p>\"It's not something I've heard discussed,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, but said that as a general rule, \"we don't comment on clemency requests\".</p></div><div><p>The files surrounding Epstein's case, including grand jury testimony, have become a political flashpoint amid demands they be released. </p><p>Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison facility in Texas after her interview with justice department officials in July. In those interviews, she denied seeing any inappropriate conduct by Trump during his interactions with Epstein.</p><p>The facility, FPC Bryant, is located about 100 miles (160km) from the Texas capital of Austin.</p><p>The family members of Giuffre, Sky and Amanda Roberts and Danny and Lanette Wilson, said in a written statement that they \"remain hopeful that the DOJ will realize that she belongs in a maximum security prison, not the country club one she is currently in\".</p></div>",

Paramount declined to comment on the reports that the firm had paid $150m in stock and cash. </p><p>Mr Ellison made his name as a Hollywood film producer of blockbusters such as Top Gun Maverick, True Grit and World War Z. </p><p>He has said his aim is to produce coverage that is less politically skewed, and therefore has the ability to reach all audiences. </p><p>His takeover of Paramount was approved by the Trump administration this summer, after the company agreed to pay $16m to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with his 2024 presidential rival Kamala Harris he said was deceptively edited to benefit Democrats. </p><p>To win approval of the deal, Mr Ellison agreed to install an independent ombudsman at CBS to review complaints of bias and committed to regulators that programming would reflect a diversity of view points. </p><p>He also said CBS's long-running political show \"Face the Nation\" would no longer air edited interviews. </p></div><div><p>CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.</p><p>In a note announcing the deal, Ms Weiss said she believed in the Paramount boss and his leadership team.</p><p>\"They are doubling down because they believe in news. Because they have courage. Because they love this country. And because they understand, as we do, that America cannot thrive without common facts, common truths, and a common reality,\" she wrote. </p></div></article>",

Trump said on social media they had a \"very good telephone call\".  </p><p>It is the first time the two have spoken formally since they had a brief encounter at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month.</p><p>Relations had been icy since Trump raised tariffs this summer to 50% on some Brazilian goods in response to the coup-plot trial of Lula's predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.</p></div><div><p> Lula had accused Trump of foreign interference and behaving like an \"emperor\".</p><p>But on Monday, the Brazilian government said the two leaders spoke in a \"friendly tone\" for half an hour and \"reminisced about the good chemistry\" they had in New York.</p><p>Lula described the meeting as an opportunity to \"restore\" friendly relations between \"the two largest Western democracies\" and reiterated that the US had a trade surplus with Brazil. </p><p>He requested that tariffs be reduced to their original 10%, and sanctions on some Brazilian officials be removed.</p><p>The two exchanged phone numbers to keep in touch directly.</p><p>Trump said on his Truth Social platform: \"It [the call] was mostly focused on the economy, and trade, between our two countries. </p><p>\"We will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future, both in Brazil and the United States.\"</p><p>Brazilian Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin described the call as \"better than expected\", and said he was optimistic about talks between the two countries.</p><p>Lula invited Trump to next month's UN climate summit in Belém, Brazil, suggested meeting during the Asean summit in Malaysia, and offered to travel to the US.</p><p>Trump has appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to continue negotiations with Brazil's vice-president, foreign minister and finance minister. </p><p>A source within the Brazilian government close to Lula told the BBC the appointment of Rubio as lead negotiator on the tariff issue was still being reviewed by the team led by Vice-President Alckmin.</p><p>The source noted that the Brazilian government was not ignoring the fact that Rubio is considered part of the so-called \"ideological wing\" of the Trump administration. </p><p>On the other hand, the source added that, for the government, it was preferable to have a negotiator who is directly connected to the president and has his endorsement, rather than someone without direct communication with Trump.</p><p>Another source, also involved in the negotiations and speaking to BBC Brasil on condition of anonymity, was more direct: they said that Lula's government would have preferred a different interlocutor to Rubio.</p></div>",

It is thought 48 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.</p><p>Trump said over the weekend the hostages could be released \"very soon\", while Netanyahu said they could be freed before the end of the Jewish holiday Sukkot - or October 13th.</p><p>Hamas has agreed to the hostage \"exchange formula\" detailed in Trump's plan, providing certain \"field conditions\" are met.</p><p>But the hostages are the group's only bargaining chip - and it's unclear whether it would be willing to release them before other elements of the deal are finalised.</p><p>Trust between the two sides is virtually non-existent. Only last month, Israel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zepgp5neo\">attempted to assassinate Hamas's negotiating team</a> with an air strike on Doha - angering not only Hamas but also Donald Trump and Qatar, a key mediator.</p><p>Members of that same negotiating team - headed by Khalil al-Hayya, whose son was killed in the strike - will now be meeting just a stone's throw from Israel's delegation in Egypt.</p></div><p></p><h2>Hamas disarmament</h2><p></p><div><p>Israel's stated goal throughout the war has been the destruction of Hamas. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated he will not stop until the group is finished. </p><p>A key point in Trump's plan requires the group to disarm. But Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established.</p><p>In its response, Hamas made no mention of disarmament - fuelling speculation that it has not changed its position.</p><p>Over the weekend, Netanyahu vowed: \"Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised – either the easy way or the hard way\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Future governance of Gaza</h2><p></p><div><p>The plan states that Hamas will have no future role in Gaza, which will be governed by a temporary transitional body of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a \"Board of Peace\" headed and chaired by Donald Trump and involving former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p>Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>Though Netanyahu agreed to all of Trump's 20-point plan, he appeared to push back on involvement of the PA even as he stood on the podium next to the president last week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jq63edv21o\">insisting it would play no role</a> in governing the territory.</p><p>This is one of many points in the plan that will be objectionable to ultranationalist hardliners within Netanyahu's governing coalition - many of whom want to retain control of Gaza and reconstruct Jewish settlements there.</p><p>In Hamas's response, it indicated that it expects to have some future role in Gaza as part of \"a unified Palestinian movement\". Though the wording is vague, this will likely be unacceptable to both Trump and the Israelis.</p></div><p></p><h2>Israeli withdrawal</h2><p></p><div><p>The extent of Israel's military withdrawal is a fourth point of contention.</p><p>The plan states that Israel's military will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes\" that must be agreed by all parties.</p><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c5ykwny8dp9o\">map distributed by the White House</a> showed three proposed stages of Israeli troop withdrawal. The first stage leaves about 55% of Gaza under Israeli control, the second 40%, and the final 15%.</p><p>That final stage would be a \"security perimeter\" that would \"remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat\".</p><p>The wording here is vague and gives no clear timeline for full Israeli withdrawal - something Hamas are likely to want clarity on.</p><p>Additionally, the map shared by the White House doesn't match up with the Israeli military's own maps showing militarised areas, and Gaza's borders are incorrectly drawn in places.</p></div><div><p><span> More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

    "body": "<div><p>Balloons carrying thousands of packs of cigarettes have disrupted flights in Lithuania, as Vilnius Airport was forced to close for hours when dozens of them floated into the country's airspace.</p><p>The National Crisis Management Centre (NCMC) told the BBC that 25 meteorological balloons were detected entering Lithuania from neighbouring Belarus, two of which ended up directly over the airport.</p><p>The airport said the shutdown led to 30 flight cancellations affecting 6,000 passengers. It warned that there may still be delays on Monday.</p><p>The \"airspace violations\" come at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c708dzqvz1vo\">a time of heightened tension in Europe</a> after a number of drone incursions, suspected of being linked to Russia, caused air traffic disruption.</p></div><div><p>Moscow has denied any involvement in the recent incidents.</p><p>Up to 14 of the weather balloons launched over the weekend floated over the Vilnius area, home to Lithuania's capital and close to the border with Belarus, Lithuanian officials said.</p><p>At least 11 balloons carrying 18,000 packs of black-market cigarettes have since been recovered, though this number could rise, Lithuania's State Border Guard Service said.</p><p>Despite the disruption they caused, a NCMC spokesman said: \"Balloons with contraband cargo - cigarettes from Belarus - are nothing new in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland.\"</p><p>So far this year, 544 balloons have been recorded entering Lithuania from Belarus, he said, while 966 were last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the north-eastern Podlaskie region of Poland, which also borders Belarus, has recorded more than 100 cases in which contraband was flown in from its neighbour using the balloons, which are typically used to carry weather instruments to high altitudes.</p><p>In one instance last month, Polish police detained a Belarusian citizen whose car had been circling cigarettes smuggled in using a balloon. A geolocation tag was reportedly found on his phone linked to the illicit goods.  </p><p>Asked why criminals use a method that is highly susceptible to the weather, rather than much more controllable drones, the NCMC spokesman said: \"Meteorological balloons are a rudimentary tool used by smugglers - they are cheaper than drones for transporting cigarettes from Belarus.\"</p><p>He added: \"Our services' aim is to seize the largest possible quantities of contraband and to detain organisers and perpetrators so that this activity is unprofitable and does not pose a risk to civil aviation.\"</p><p>Drones of unclear origin caused the closure of Danish airports and airspace in September. Drones were also seen over neighbouring Norway and Germany, prompting European leaders to accelerate discussions about strengthening air defences.</p><p>Denmark said at the time there was no evidence to suggest Russian involvement, despite Moscow being blamed for earlier airspace incursions into Poland, Estonia and Romania. </p><p>Russia either denied these earlier incursions or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7401vk4lgzo\">said they were accidental</a> as its full-scale invasion of nearby Ukraine continues.</p></div>",

He can once again dissolve the National Assembly. Or he can resign himself.</p><p>The last is the least likely, while the first would be his natural choice.</p><p>However, who now could he name to form a government? Lecornu – the ultimate Macron loyalist – was seen as his last resort, but now he too has failed.</p><p>He could appoint a Socialist, on the basis that the left deserves a go at government - but a Socialist administration would itself not take long to fall.</p><p>So the logic must surely be for option two: for new legislative elections.</p><p>The result would probably be a rout for the pro-Macron centre, and a big victory for the hard-right of Marine Le Pen. But when every other recourse fails, few avenues remain.</p><p>Lecornu, a former armed forces minister, was France's fifth prime minister in under two years. </p><p>In his brief speech outside the Hôtel de Matignon on Monday morning, the prime minister's residence which he only occupied for less than a month, Lecornu sharply criticised the \"partisan appetites\" of political factions, who he said \"are all behaving as if they had an absolute majority\". </p><p>\"I was ready for compromise but all parties wanted the other party to adopt their programmes in their entirety,\" he said. </p><p>\"It wouldn't need much for this to work,\" he added, saying, however, that parties needed to be more humble and \"to cast some egos aside\".</p><p>The entrenched divisions in French politics have made it difficult for any prime minister to garner the necessary support to pass any bills.</p><p>Michel Barnier was appointed prime minister last September but was toppled within three months in a vote of no confidence.</p><p>The government of his successor François Bayrou's too was voted down after nine months after parliament refused to back his austerity budget, which aimed to slash government spending by €44bn ($51bn; £38bn). </p><p>France's deficit reached 5.8% of its GDP in 2024 and its national debt is 114% of its GDP. That is the third highest public debt in the eurozone after Greece and Italy, and equivalent to almost €50,000 per French citizen.</p></div>",

Hundreds of local villagers and rescue workers have been deployed to clear out snow blocking access to the area, which sits at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). </p><p>Rescuers have guided 350 people to safety in the small township of Qudang. Authorities are in contact with all the hikers who are still trapped.</p></div><div><p>Nature photographer Dong Shuchang was among hundreds of tourists who flocked to the area during China's Golden Week holiday. </p><p>He was looking forward to capturing the Himalayan marvel from the Tibetan slopes, when the snowstorm hit just hours after his trek started on Saturday.</p><p>\"The lightning and thunderstorms would not stop. The snowfall was so heavy I could hardly sleep,\" Mr Dong explained.</p><p>His group had reached an altitude of 4,600m before they decided to turn back.  </p><p>\"Our windbreakers and raincoats were no match for the snow. We were all drenched,\" he said, adding that several people in his group of 20 showed signs of hypothermia.</p><p>The 27-year-old had been to the Himalayas more than a dozen times, but said he has \"never experienced weather like this\". </p><p>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet.</p><p>\"Everyone was moving slowly.

He pleaded not guilty.</p><p>A US federal charge ruled on Friday that Mr Garcia's prosecution could be for \"vindictive\" reasons, and he would hear more evidence before reaching a final decision. </p><p>The BBC has asked Eswatini government acting spokesperson Thabile Mdluli whether or not he was among the latest group to be deported. </p><p>In an earlier statement, she said the deportees would be kept in a \"secured area separate from the public, while arrangements are made for their return to their countries of origin\". </p><p>Their arrival comes a day before a court case against the deportations is set to resume in the main city, Mbabane. </p><p>Mr Masuku, who represents civil society groups challenging the deal, said he would have expected  the government to \"respect the court process and await its ruling\" before accepting more deportees. </p><p>In September, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had seen the agreement between the Eswatini and US governments. </p><p>It provides for Eswatini to accept up to 160 deportees in exchange for $5.1m (£3.79m) from the US to build its \"border and migration management capacity\", HRW said.</p><p>The Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC) - along with other civil society groups - argues that the government's decision amounts to \"executive over-reach\" and Eswatini's constitution states that such agreements should be reached with parliamentary consent, something that did not happen in this instance. </p><p>Activists also protested against the deal outside the US embassy when the first deportees arrived.</p><p>The civic groups say the deal is secretive and an example of \"democratic regression\", 20 years after Eswatini adopted a constitution to give more of a say to parliament in a country where the king has long wielded absolute power.</p><p>\"We would have expected this milestone to reflect a maturation of our democracy - stronger rule of law, greater accountability, and clearer separation of powers,\" the SALC's  Melusi Simelane told the BBC. </p><p>The government is defending the case, saying it acted within its powers and that the constitution makes allowances for it to reach such agreements with foreign governments.</p><p>Some Eswatini MPs had previously raised concerns about the deal in parliament, but Prime Minister Russell Dlamini said it had been handled at  \"top clearance level\". </p><p>The deal also alarmed neighbouring South Africa, which expressed fears that the deportees could cross into the country via their porous border. </p><p>Ms Mdluli tried to allay the fears by saying the deportees were being held in solitary confinement in a secure facility. </p><p>Previously known as Swaziland, Eswatini is a small, landlocked country surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique. It has been led by King Mswati III since 1986.</p></div>",

He declined to offer specifics, saying that could enable local authorities to prepare their next motions in court.</p><p>On Monday,  White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also told reporters that Judge Immergut's decision was \"untethered in reality and in the law, and said that Trump was legally within his rights to call up the National Guard \"in cases where he deems it appropriate\". </p><p>\"We're very confident in the president's legal authority to do this,\" she said. \"And we're very confident we will win on the merits of the law.\" </p><p>The temporary restraining order will remain in effect until at least 19 October.

The state-based military force can be called up by either a state governor or the US president. It is often deployed to provide disaster relief after floods and hurricanes but can also support military operations overseas.</p><p>In September, a federal judge in California ruled Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles was illegal because it violated an act that limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p><p>The administration is appealing against that decision. </p><p><i>(With additional reporting from Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House) </i></p></div><p>Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

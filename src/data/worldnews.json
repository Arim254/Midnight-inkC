The search warrant was based on a lead investigators had received, but no arrests were made, the Pima County sheriff's department said. A person was also questioned at a traffic stop on Friday night, but was released, the department added. It comes after local officials said investigators had found DNA at Guthrie's address that did not belong to her or anyone close to her.The 84-year-old disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, two weeks ago. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.The sheriff's department confirmed on Saturday that law enforcement officers had executed a federal court-ordered search warrant based on a lead at the residence in connection with the Guthrie case.The department did not provide further details about the lead or the residents of the house, saying only that no one was arrested. More than a dozen law enforcement vehicles, both marked and unmarked, were  seen in the area by BBC News, including Swat teams and forensics.Armed police teams were seen coming in and out of the area, with a sheriff's vehicle blocking the road.Investigators have also found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home.The sheriff's department said reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property were inaccurate. All collected evidence had been sent for laboratory analysis, they added.It said investigators had been able to establish identifying details about the suspect after analysing footage from a doorbell camera outside Guthrie's home.Getty ImagesUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie and her mother NancyThe suspect was wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack in the footage, the FBI said. After the doorbell footage was released, investigators received more than 13,000 tips, including 4,000 in the first 24 hours.The FBI has also increased the reward for information about Guthrie's disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.The county sheriff department said the suspect description \"remains a key focus\", but added that \"investigators are not ruling out any individuals or possibilities\". Investigators have also issued a wider appeal for video footage from Guthrie's neighbours.Police have said Nancy Guthrie, 84, needed daily medication and had limited mobility.Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's abductor.They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her safe return.Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's home",

    "body": "22 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesThe event was due to take place over five days in late FebruaryAn annual cigar festival in Cuban capital Havana has become the latest casualty of a fuel shortage caused by a US oil blockade.The organising committee of the Festival del Habano announced on Saturday that this year's event - which was due to take place over five days in late February - would be postponed until further notice. It said the decision was motivated \"by the complex economic situation\" facing Cuba due to the \"economic, commercial and financial blockade\" by the US.A fuel shortage causing power cuts on the Caribbean island has been worsened by the US seizing oil shipments from Cuba's long-standing ally Venezuela.Cuba also has a shortage of aviation fuel, leading several airlines to suspend services there, while some countries, including the UK, have warned against non-essential travel to the island.Cuban cigars are regarded as among the finest in the world, but are illegal in the US due to long-standing American trade embargoes. More than 1,300 people from around 70 countries are estimated to attend the Habano Festival each year to sample cigars from Cuba's producers, as well as visit tobacco plantations and factories.With international tourism to the island nation limited by the US embargo, the festival's organisers said they hoped to wait until conditions had improved.The organising committee said it was working on setting a new date, which has yet to be announced.\"The priority of the Habano Festival is to offer its participants a comprehensive experience at the height of the relevance and prestige that this event represents internationally,\" it said.\"The postponement of this celebration is a measure aimed at protecting this experience.\"Venezuela was previously believed to have sent around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba before the US military seized former president Nicolás Maduro on 3 January.Power cuts lasting up to 18 hours a day have since affected hospital emergency wards, dialysis patients and pumping stations.US President Donald Trump has urged Cuban leaders to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences.UN human rights experts have described Washington's restrictions on Cuba's oil imports as an \"extreme form of unilateral economic coercion\".The US and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the communist Fidel Castro overthrew a US-backed government in 1959. US economic and trade embargoes on Cuba have been in place since 1960.While steps were taken to improve diplomatic relations, particularly under former US President Barack Obama, the Trump administration has reversed many of these moves.",

    "body": "18 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesObama seen on the campaign trail in November 2025Former US President Barack Obama has indirectly addressed a racist video posted on President Donald Trump's social media, telling a podcast host that the \"shame\" and \"decorum\" that once guided public officials is now lost.The offensive video included a clip depicting Obama and his wife Michelle as apes, which drew widespread criticism from Democrats and Republicans. The White House initially defended the video, calling backlash \"fake outrage\". The post was later blamed on a staff member and deleted.Obama spoke to liberal podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, who asked the first black US president about the tone of political discourse. Cohen cited Trump's post among several recent controversies. The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was included at the end of a video Trump's Truth Social account shared containing unfounded claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. The post led to outrage from politicians, including from senior members of Trump's Republican party.Senator Tim Scott - the only black Republican senator - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The clip recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys, and appears to have been taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October.Trump has told reporters that he \"didn't see\" the part of the video that showed the Obamas.\"I didn't make a mistake,\" he told reporters when asked whether he planned to apologise.The 47-minute podcast featuring Obama was released on Saturday. The episode begins with the host asking him to comment on US \"discourse\", which he says \"has devolved to a level of cruelty that we haven't seen before\".Cohen notes claims by the White House that the \"victims\" of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are \"domestic terrorists\", and adds \"just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face, on an ape's body\".Obama responds by saying: \"It's important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling.\"It is true that it gets attention. It's true that it's a distraction.\"But Obama said that while travelling around the US, he found himself meeting people who \"still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness\".\"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television,\" he continued. \"And what is true is that there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? \"That's been lost.\"He did not mention Trump by name in his response.During the interview, Obama spoke about a range of issues. He praised protesters who have peacefully organised against immigration operations, discussed electoral redistricting and talked about his presidential library, which is due to open in Chicago next year.Watch: Trump says he 'didn't see' racist clip depicting Obamas as apes",

Footage it published showed officers, still in their masks, leading the two suspect away and into a waiting police car. Among the disguises was the red overalls and mask from the Spanish Netflix show Money Heist.Police said the two seen being detained in the footage had 30 criminal records between them, and that the woman pretended to be pregnant to avoid arrest.Police added that the arrests form part of Operation Tracking, a state initiative aimed at tackling the theft and resale of mobile phones, which has led to more than 13,000 devices being located and approximately 4,400 being returned.It is not the first time Latin American officers have used fancy dress while apprehending suspected criminals.Peruvian police often use the tactics, disguising their agents in elaborate costumes on occasions such as Valentine's Day, Halloween and Christmas.Raids have also been carried out dressed as the Grinch, a capybara and various other Marvel superheroes.",

Thousands more deaths are being investigated.Pahlavi told the crowd: \"My first message is to our brave and fighting compatriots inside the country: know that you are not alone, and today the world stands with you in this struggle.\"Criticising Iran's leadership, he said: \"In contrast to this corrupt, repressive, child-killing regime, you represent a great culture and civilisation, and in a free Iran of tomorrow you will prove to the world what a great nation we are.\"EPAReza Pahlavi and his wife Yasmine Pahlavi in Munich on Saturday Pahlavi's daughter, Noor Pahlavi, addressed a crowd in Los Angeles. The BBC's US partner CBS News reported her as saying Iranians had \"never been this close to freeing up themselves from this Islamic regime\". She called on US President Donald Trump to end ongoing nuclear talks with Iran's leadership, describing it as \"negotiation with murderers\". On Friday, Trump told reporters a change in Iran's government would be the \"best thing that could happen\", though it was unclear whether his comments were in reference to Pahlavi, who is seeking a role in Iran. Trump told news agency Reuters last month that Pahlavi seemed \"very nice\" but expressed uncertainty over whether he could muster enough support within Iran to eventually lead it.Andolu via Getty ImagesThe largest rally was held in Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 people turned out to protestLightRocket via Getty ImagesPeople gathered to protest across the world, including in LondonIn Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 joined a demonstration, participants told BBC Persian they were there to speak out on behalf of friends and family inside Iran.Street protests broke out in Iran on 28 December, initially sparked by economic turmoil and fuelled by long-running discontent with the country's leaders.Demonstrations spread to more than 100 cities and towns across all of Iran's provinces. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has confirmed the deaths of 6,872 protesters, including more than 150 children.Many demonstrators in Iran have chanted Pahlavi's name and called for his return to political leadership.Groomed from birth to inherit the throne, Pahlavi was 18 years old when the 1979 Islamic revolution swept away his father's monarchy.Almost 50 years later, Pahlavi is once again seeking to shape his country's future.But critics question whether his vision for Iran would ultimately lead to a democracy.More on this story ",

    "body": "6 hours agoJoel Gunter, in JerusalemandFiona NimoniGettyHamas and Israel have both repeatedly accused each other of breaching a ceasefire agreement Eleven Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday morning, according to Palestinian civil defence and health officials.The IDF said it had struck terror targets in response to ceasefire violations by Hamas, and that militants had been killed after emerging from a tunnel into the area of the strip controlled by the Israeli military.The Palestinian Red Crescent said a strike on a tent encampment in northern Gaza killed at least six people, while another strike in the south of the strip killed five.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations of a fragile ceasefire agreement since it took effect on 10 October.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said at least 600 people have been killed since the ceasefire went into effect. The latest strikes came as the preparations continued for the implementation of the second phase of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement. Last month, US President Donald Trump announced a new body called the Board of Peace, which has a mandate from the United Nations Security Council to establish an international force tasked with securing border areas in Gaza, and overseeing the disarmament of Hamas. The board, which was due to have its first meeting in Washington on 19 February, will also oversee the formation of a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza and post-war reconstruction.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Wednesday to meet US President Donald Trump, where they discussed ways to curb Iran's nuclear programme - which Tehran has always insisted is for purely civilian purposes. Netanyahu was expected to press Trump to pursue an agreement that would halt Iran's uranium enrichment, as well as cutting its ballistic missile programme. However, Trump later said there was \"nothing definitive reached\" and that talks with Iran would continue. More on this story ",

A security report cited by AFP news agency said bandits came on 41 motorcycles, each carrying two or three men.Abdullahi Rofia, a resident of neighbouring Agwara, told the BBC that many displaced people have taken shelter in his community, which was itself attacked two weeks ago.\"People are so traumatised, they no longer go to farm nor do they go to market,\" he said.\"The bandits are not interesting in stealing or looting - they are more interested in killing and terrorising locals.\"Authorities have introduced emergency measures, including a restriction on late-night gatherings and a \"partial curfew\" that bans motorcycle taxis from operating after 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT).Police confirmed that security teams have been deployed and rescue efforts are ongoing.Nigeria's leaders are under pressure to curb violence, with jihadist groups active in the north-west and separatist insurgents based in the country's south-east.The US launched Christmas Day strikes targeting Islamist militants in Nigeria's northern Sokoto state and President Donald Trump warned of further attacks \"if they continue to kill Christians\". Many of the victims of jihadist violence are Muslim, according to organisations monitoring political violence in Nigeria.It came after more than 250 children and staff were abducted from a Catholic school in Papiri, in one of the largest recent mass-kidnappings. Their release was later secured.",

    "body": "54 minutes agoMakuochi OkaforWest Africa reporterGetty ImagesThe man is accused of filming several women during sexual encounters, without their consent. (File picture)Ghana intends to request the extradition of a Russian man accused of illegally recording his sexual encounters with several women and sharing footage online without their consent.African and Russian media identified him as a self-styled \"pick-up artist\" and online blogger in his 30s who had travelled to Ghana to secretly film his interactions with women.Outlets in both countries claimed the man used a pair of sunglasses fitted with a camera to film some encounters and circulated them on social media, though officials did not confirm this.Speaking to journalists on Saturday, Sam George, Ghana's technology minister, said he had invited the Russian ambassador to discuss the alleged incident.Earlier, Ghana's Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection said an initial investigation had established the suspect had likely left the country.It added that did \"not reduce the seriousness of the alleged conduct or the state's responsibility to pursue accountability\".George said he had asked the Russian ambassador in the capital city Accra for Moscow's cooperation in getting justice for the victims.However, Russia does not extradite its citizens, except in extreme circumstances.The minister told BBC News: \"I have invited the Russian ambassador in Ghana for a meeting.\"The actions of the Russian citizen flout our cyber-security laws. I will officially indicate to the ambassador our official position.\"Earlier, he told reporters: \"That gentleman will be looked for, we will activate every resource in our disposal working with Interpol. \"We will request the Russian authorities – and that is why I have invited the Russian ambassador – to work with our law enforcement. \"We want the gentleman to be brought back to Ghana, extradited to Ghana for him to face the rigours of our law.\"George said they would try the suspect in absentia if he failed to return to Ghana.Local media report the same man had been involved in similar illegal acts in Kenya.Under Ghana's Cybersecurity Act 2020, anyone who publishes explicit images of children or adults without full consent can face up to 25 years in prison.Authorities in Ghana have been paying increasing attention to online abuse, including sexual extortion and romance scams.There has been an increase in arrests in recent years for these offences.In 2022, a court sentenced a 22-year-old phone repairer, Solomon Doga, to 14 years in prison for sharing nude images of a Lebanese woman. He pleaded guilty to sexual extortion and non-consensual sharing of intimate images.Ghana also introduced new laws under the Cybersecurity Act 2020 to punish those who share nude photos or videos online, especially of women and children, often for revenge or blackmail.",

    "body": "1 day agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersProminent US agent Casey Wasserman is selling his talent company after documents linking him to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were published in the US.Several high-profile clients, including singer Chappell Roan, quit the firm this week after it emerged he flew on Epstein's private plane and exchanged flirtatious emails with Maxwell in 2003.Wasserman said in an company-wide email sent on Friday that he had \"become a distraction\" as he announced he has begun the process to sell the major LA-based agency.The 51-year-old, who has also resisted calls to stand down from his role as chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, previously said he had no \"personal or business relationship\" with Epstein.\"I'm deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,\" Wasserman wrote to the agency's 4,000 employees in the email, which was obtained by the BBC.He continued: \"It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about.\"Wasserman said he \"deeply regrets\" his discussions with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for facilitating the sexual abuse of teenage girls by Epstein. He said his email exchanges with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Earlier this week, LA28 said Wasserman would remain chairman of the 2028 games after organisers reviewed his past interactions with Maxwell. They found his relationship did not go further than the exchanges that had already been documented and that he had fully co-operated with an investigation. The LA28 board said in a statement that Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein's plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation in 2003.The board said the journey was long before \"Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell's deplorable crimes\". \"This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell,\" the statement continued.A number of stars have have walked away from Wasserman's agency in recent days.She said: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\"Roan did not specifically mention the Epstein-related documents in her statement. Other musical artists have announced their plans to exit Wasserman's agency, including country music singer-songwriter Orville Peck, North Carolina-based rock band Wednesday, and singer-songwriter Weyes Blood. Former US football player Abby Wambach also said she was leaving the agency, saying: \"I know what I know and I am following my gut and values. I will not participate in any business arrangement under his leadership.\"",

    "body": "24 hours agoAFP via Getty ImagesThe $1.6m (£1.2m) trial was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (stock image)A now-halted plan to run a hepatitis B vaccine trial involving thousands of newborns in Guinea-Bissau has been criticised by the World Health Organization as \"unethical\".The US-funded study had sought to give one set of babies the vaccine at birth, while another would have had the shot delayed until six weeks of age. The WHO said it had \"significant concerns\" about the plan, and described the birth-dose vaccine as \"an effective and essential public health intervention, with a proven record\".The US health department, headed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has questioned the effects of vaccines, had sought to use the trial to answer questions about the jab's broader health effects.The WHO said on Friday that its concerns regarded the study's scientific justification, ethical safeguards and consistency with established standards for research involving humans.It stressed that the jab had been used for more than three decades in more than 115 countries.The WHO said giving a proven life-saving intervention to some newborns but not others exposed them to \"potentially irreversible harm\".A sizeable portion of Guinea-Bissau's population is estimated to have hepatitis B, and the WHO says vaccination at birth prevents the virus being transmitted from mother to baby in 70-95% of cases.It argued that trials giving one group a placebo or not treating them were only acceptable when no proven treatment existed, something that was not the case with the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine.The WHO recommends that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. It says infection at birth is the most common way of having a lifelong infection, with 90% of infected newborns becoming chronic carriers.In Guinea-Bissau, the dose is currently given at six weeks, though authorities plan to introduce the birth dose nationwide by 2028 to align with global standards, something the WHO said it would help accelerate.A total of 14,000 babies in the West African country were due to be involved in the study funded by the US and led by Danish researchers.But public outrage at the project prompted the Guinea-Bissau government to suspend it last month. 'We are not guinea pigs'Critics have questioned why babies in the African country were being proposed for the trial.Two months ago, a panel of top advisers voted to stop recommending that all newborns in the US receive a hepatitis B vaccine.Kennedy has on several occasions denied being against vaccinations and has said he and his children had been vaccinated, but has also repeatedly stated widely debunked claims about vaccine harms.Vocal opponents of the project in Guinea-Bissau include the country's former health minister, Magda Robalo.Most people with the virus do not have any symptoms, or have very mild symptoms.But some people can experience jaundice, dark urine, feeling very tired, nausea, vomiting and pain in the abdomen.The WHO says chronic patients have a high risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "14 hours agoAdam GoldsmithandTom McArthurGetty ImagesRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, the UK and European allies have said.Two years on from the death of Navalny at a Siberian penal colony, Britain and its allies have blamed the Kremlin following analysis of material samples found on his body.Speaking from the Munich Security Conference, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity\" to use the poison while Navalny was imprisoned in Russia.According to Tass news agency Moscow has dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\", but Cooper said there is no explanation for the toxin, called epibatidine, being found.While Cooper announced the findings, a joint statement was issued by the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.Cooper met with Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya at the conference this weekend.\"Russia saw Navalny as a threat,\" Cooper said at the event.\"By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,\" she added.In the statement the allies said: \"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.\"Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia.\"There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny's body.\"The Foreign Office said the UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia's alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Praising Navalny's \"huge courage\", UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"his determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy\".\"I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin's murderous intent,\" he added.Watch: 'Only Russian state had means' to poison Navalny, says Yvette CooperFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot also said his country \"pays tribute\" to Navalny, who he suggested was \"killed for his fight in favour of a free and democratic Russia\".Navalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47.In 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.'Extremely rare' toxinEpibatidine, the toxin the UK and its European allies have said was used to kill Alexei Navalny, was first derived from a group of poison dart frogs native to northern South America.Though epibatidine has previously been investigated as a pain killer and for relief from painful inflammatory conditions of the lungs, it has been deemed too toxic to use clinically.Speaking to BBC Russian, toxicology expert Jill Johnson said it was \"200 times more potent than morphine\". By acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause \"muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death,\" Johnson said.The extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in one wild frog species in tiny quantities, and only when the frog eats a specific diet, she told the BBC.Researchers believe the frogs acquire it through their diet because animals from different habitats have displayed different levels of the toxin, and those raised in captivity have none.Johnson described it as an \"incredibly rare way to poison a person\".She added: \"Finding the wild frog in the correct location that is eating the specific diet to create the correct alkaloids is almost impossible...almost.\"German Federal Foreign Office via Getty ImagesNavalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently claimed that her husband was poisoned by RussiaBefore Saturday's announcement, Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently argued that her husband was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.She did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results.Reacting to the announcement, Navalnaya said: \"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof.\"I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,\" she added.According to the state-run news agency Tass, Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: \"All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to the penal colony.According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk at his Siberian penal colony, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.",

    "body": "19 hours agoTinshui YeungReutersThe US Secretary of State signalled the Trump administration wants to strengthen ties with the continent during a speech in MunichMarco Rubio has assured European leaders the US does not plan to abandon the transatlantic alliance, saying its destiny \"will always be intertwined\" with the continent's.The US secretary of state told the Munich Security Conference: \"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history.\"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was \"very much reassured\" by Rubio's remarks.Rubio, the Trump administration's most senior diplomat, said it was \"neither our goal nor our wish\" to end the transatlantic partnership, adding: \"For us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.\"And I am here today to leave it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity, and that once again we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends.\"Follow updates on this storyHowever, he repeated several criticisms repeatedly levelled at Europe by the Trump administration, including describing immigration policies as a threat to civilisation, and saying a \"climate cult\" had taken over economic policy. On trade, he said Europe and the US had \"made mistakes together\" by adopting a \"dogmatic vision of free and unfettered trade\". He repeated familiar calls from the US for Europe to invest more in defence, saying: \"We want allies who can defend themselves so that no adversary will ever be tempted to test our collective strength.\"In response, von der Leyen said: \"[Rubio is] a good friend, a strong ally. And this was, for me, very reassuring to listen to him.\"She continued: \"We want a strong Europe. And this is, I think, the message of today.\"Elsewhere in his half-hour address, Rubio said the system of international co-operation \"must be rebuilt\" and singled out the UN for particular criticism, saying it had \"played virtually no role\" in resolving the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts. He also said the organisation was \"powerless to constrain the nuclear programme\" of Tehran.In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if a deal to curb its nuclear programme can be reached, as negotiations between the two intensify.AFP via Getty ImagesOutside the Munich Security Conference, a large crowd of protesters gathered to denounce the Iranian government A second round of talks will be hosted by Oman in Geneva next week, the Swiss foreign ministry said on Saturday.Outside the conference, an estimated 200,000 protesters held a rally against the Iranian government, local police report.The demonstrators denounced the country's leadership, following the government crackdown on January's protests in which thousands of people were killed.Rubio also said the US did not know whether the \"Russians are serious about ending the war\" in Ukraine, before adding: \"But we're going to continue to test it.\"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky told the conference later on Saturday that no one in Ukraine believed his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin would leave the country alone, describing the Russian leader as a \"slave to war\".Zelensky has come under pressure from the White House to hold presidential elections, which have been suspended while the country is under martial law.Asked about a Financial Times report that his administration was planning for elections as soon as May, Zelensky said it was \"something new to me\" and repeated that \"nobody supports elections during the war\".He said that Ukraine would need \"two months of ceasefire\" and \"security infrastructure\" to safely conduct elections. The UK PM also called for deeper links and co-operation, including a \"closer economic alignment\", between the UK and the EU.Addressing Russian threats to the continent, he told the conference: \"We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age.\"ReutersZelensky rejected a report from the Financial Times that said his administration is planning elections for MayAs part of efforts to bolster security, Sir Keir announced the UK - in a joint initiative with the US, Canada and other Nato allies - would deploy a fleet of warships, submarines and aircraft to the Arctic and High North.Trump insists the world's largest island is critical for US security and has not ruled out taking it by force - though his administration is seeking a negotiated settlement.Its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region. The US currently has more than 100 personnel stationed at its monitoring base there and, under a 1951 agreement, it can send as many troops as it wants to Greenland.Addressing the growing tensions, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stressed that Greenland could not be assigned a price, adding that nations' sovereignty must be respected.Frederiksen, alongside Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Finland's President Alexander Stubb, also echoed calls for a unified response to Russia.Sánchez said there was a need to \"stop Putin\" and strengthen European defence capabilities, but added: \"Let's do it in a co-ordinated and targeted way.\"He also insisted on the building of a \"true European army, not in 10 years but now\".Frederiksen added that Putin was not interested in peace and that \"we have to recognise... that Russia will not change\".She said Europe \"knows exactly what we need to deliver,\" referencing Ukraine's calls for additional air defences.Stubb said he did not see a \"direct threat\" from Russia to Nato right now, but an Arctic training exercise with 20,000 Nato soldiers would help outline possible defence scenarios.",

    "body": "An abduction, a Bitcoin demand and a TV icon - why Nancy Guthrie's case has gripped the US14 hours agoDavid WillisTucson, ArizonaGetty ImagesBefore the sun rose over a barren desert landscape, YouTuber Jimmy Williams watched as hundreds of subscribers took to his online chat room.A laptop balanced precariously on his knees, his iPhone framed by a ring light, he spends several hours a day dissecting the details of Nancy Guthrie's sudden disappearance with his rapidly growing audience of fellow true-crime enthusiasts.Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and authorities believe she was taken against her will in the early hours of 1 February.Williams is just one of dozens of curious observers and amateur sleuths who have descended on the area.The influx of spectators has turned a quiet mid-size city, popular with retirees, into a global media spectacle.Police have yet to identify any suspects in her abduction, and her daughter – the Today show presenter Savannah Guthrie – has repeatedly begged the public for help in finding her mother.A reassuring face on morning television in the US, Savannah Guthrie now finds herself at the same intersection of hope and dread that has defined many of her interviewees.This time, however, the roles have been reversed, and instead of asking questions she is the one awaiting answers.Breakfast television affords its presenters a special sense of intimacy with their audience, with segments often focusing on human-interest stories.Savannah Guthrie spent her childhood in Tucson and in November she even invited people into her mum's home for a segment on the Today show.Kelly Himes lives several miles from Nancy Guthrie's home in the shadow of the Catalina Mountains. Like a growing number of Tucson residents, she felt compelled to stop and say a prayer alongside the growing array of flowers at the end of her driveway.\"Nancy's the same age as my mum, the same height as my mum, and she's got the same hair,\" Himes tells the BBC. \"She lives alone just like my mum does. This is someone who could be anybody's mother.\"Savannah Guthrie's fame has proved to be a double-edged sword. As well as drawing an unprecedented amount of attention and resources to the search for her mother, it has also inspired feverish speculation and given rise to a string of false leads.Getty ImagesThe case has turned the quiet mid-size city of Tucson into a global media spectacleTwo weeks after Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, investigators revealed they had found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from her home.The sheriff's department also said media reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property were inaccurate.To Williams' growing audience, speculation over the case only heightens its intrigue.Since Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, Williams' YouTube channel Dollyvision has gained more than 8,000 new subscribers.Interest in Nancy's disappearance is \"massive\", he says.\"You expect kidnappings to involve cash in a bag dropped off somewhere remote, and then the police turn up and arrest everyone. This is different. This is like a 'new age' of kidnapping.\"The days of ransom demands made up of letters cut from the pages of a magazine seem a thing of the past.Secure servers, secret IP addresses and untraceable Bitcoin accounts have changed the face of one of the world's oldest crimes - but a former FBI hostage negotiator, Chip Massey, says he believes Nancy Guthrie's kidnappers would soon be caught.Referring to the video images of a masked man on her doorstep shortly before she disappeared, he said somebody, somewhere, would recognise the suspect based either on their behaviour or their body language.\"The attention this case has generated is unprecedented,\" he says, \"and while a mask can conceal a face, it can't conceal a person.\"Getty ImagesSavannah Guthrie has repeatedly begged the public for help in finding her motherMissing person flyers featuring pictures of Nancy's smiling face, combined with motorway billboards promoting the FBI's tip line have made this case impossible to ignore, even for those who don't watch the news. The White House has said the FBI would be giving the investigation its \"full resources\".\"So many people now seem to be engaged with this search that it is going to very hard for this individual to function,\" says Massey. \"That sort of scrutiny makes it impossible for a suspect to move and creates a sense of the world 'closing in' on them. That's when they start to make mistakes.\"Yellow ribbons now adorn the trees around Nancy Guthrie's home - but as days pass with no word of her whereabouts, the hope of an emotional homecoming is rapidly giving way to a deepening sense of dread.",

    "body": "2 days agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent, DhakaReutersTarique Rahman is expected to become Bangladesh's new prime minister - despite never before holding powerJust over two years ago, when Sheikh Hasina won an election widely condemned as rigged in her favour, it was hard to imagine her 15-year grip on power being broken so suddenly, or that a rival party that had been virtually written off would make such a resounding comeback.But in the cycle of Bangladeshi politics, this is one more flip-flop between Hasina's Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which have alternated holding power for decades.Except this is the first time that new BNP leader Tarique Rahman is formally leading the party - and the first time he's contested an election.His mother Khaleda Zia, who died of an illness late last year, was the party's head for four decades. She took over after his father, Ziaur Rahman, the BNP founder and a key leader of Bangladesh's war for independence, was assassinated.Accused of benefitting from nepotism when his mother was in power, Tarique Rahman has also faced allegations of corruption. Five days before his mother died he returned to Bangladesh after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London.And while Rahman, 60, has on occasion been the de-facto chair of an emaciated BNP when his mother was jailed and more recently when she was ill, he's largely seen as an untested leader.\"That he doesn't have prior experience probably works for him, because people are willing to give change a chance,\" says political scientist Navine Murshid. \"They want to think that new, good things are actually possible. So there is a lot of hope.\"Getty ImagesBangladesh's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in a 2024 uprisingThe party says its first priority is to bring democracy back to Bangladesh.\"All the democratic institutions [and] financial institutions, which have been destroyed over the last decade, we have to first put those back in order,\" senior BNP leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury told the BBC shortly after the election was called.Bangladesh has a long history of such promises being made and broken, with parties becoming increasingly authoritarian once they come to power.But this time, the country's young, who came out in the \"July uprising\" of 2024 that ousted Hasina, appear less tolerant of accepting more of the same.\"We don't want to fight again,\" says Tazin Ahmed, a 19-year-old who participated in the uprising.\"The stepping down of the previous prime minister was not the victory. When our country runs smoothly without any corruption, and the economy becomes good, that will be our main victory.\"Her cousin Tahmina Tasnim, 21, says: \"The first thing we want is unity among the people. We have the right to a stable nation and a stable economy. We have been part of an uprising and we know how to fight back. So if the same things start again, we will have the right to do it again.\"Sanjay Ganguly/BBCCousins Tahmina Tasnim, 21, and Tazin Ahmed, 19, had participated in the uprising and were first-time voters in this electionSince Hasina was ousted, violence has marred the tenure of Bangladesh's interim leader Mohammad Yunus.Getting a grip on law and order will need to be a key priority for the new government. Reviving the economy, reducing food prices and creating jobs for Bangladesh's large young population are other massive challenges.Sociologist Samina Luthfa says the lack of experience of running a government affects all parties.For the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, which has been banned twice in Bangladesh's history, including under Hasina, this is its first time winning a sizeable number of seats.Its alliance partner, the National Citizens Party (NCP), formed by some of the students who led the uprising, has won six seats in its debut performance.\"We are going to see leaders in the parliament who have never been to the parliament before,\" Luthfa says. \"NCP youngsters have a lot to learn. The others are seasoned politicians but they do not have the experience of running the country. So it's going to be an uphill task.\"Aakriti Thapar/BBCAll parties have faced accusations of letting Bangladeshi women down by not having more female candidatesJamaat's manifesto was secular and development-focused, making no mention of Islamic law.But its website reads: \"Jamaat performs in political arena because Islamic law can't be implemented without political force\", which has always led to questions about what the party would do if it ever came to power.Murshid says Jamaat's performance in this election is unsurprising. \"Jamaat is a very organised political party. For the last several decades, they have worked relentlessly at the grassroots level,\" she says. \"I think that has to be recognised but, of course, the problematic part is that they are inherently anti-democratic, misogynistic and patriarchal.\"Luthfa says all parties have let the women of Bangladesh down. Just over 4% of candidates were women.\"We the women who were part of the July uprising - all political parties have failed to translate our collective agency into a more formal political, electoral arena,\" she says. \"Parliament members now need to make haste so that they can bring in skilled, honest and deserving candidates to the seats reserved for women in parliament.\"Aakriti Thapar/BBCThis election is the first in a few in which the outcome was not known before polling beganOf the 350 seats in Bangladesh's parliament, 300 are elected and the remaining 50 are reserved for women who are nominated by political parties in proportion to their electoral performance.While this election was starkly different from the past few polls under Hasina – being genuinely competitive, with the outcome not known before polling began -  the barring of her party from the election has cast a shadow over its credibility.Given its claims of reviving democracy, when asked if it would support bringing the Awami League back into the political fold, senior BNP leader Chowdhury said: \"It is not for us to decide. \"For the Awami League to come back to the electoral process in Bangladesh, it's going to take a while, because their credibility is in question. When you are accused of killing your own people, of atrocities, persecution, then the people will decide where they fit in in the future of Bangladesh politics.\"From her exile in India, Hasina has termed Thursday's poll an \"election of deception and farce\" and has called for a fresh election in which the Awami League is allowed to participate.At the moment, public anger against her party is intense, but given Bangladesh's political history, it would be premature to write off the Awami League forever.Additional reporting by Aakriti Thapar",

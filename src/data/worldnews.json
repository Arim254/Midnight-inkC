    "body": "18 hours agoSeher AsafGetty ImagesThe Bangalore-bound bus was carrying about 40 passengers when it collided with a motorcycle on Friday A bus fire that killed at least 20 people in southern India was intensified by hundreds of smartphones being onboard, local reports say, citing forensics officials.Flames rapidly engulfed the Bangalore-bound bus after it collided with a motorcycle that ruptured its fuel tank and triggered an explosion early on Friday.Eyewitnesses said the approximately 40 passengers had struggled to escape as locals rushed to pull out survivors.Forensic experts have now told local media that the bus had been carrying a shipment of 234 mobile phones, and that the lithium-ion batteries they contained likely exacerbated the fire once they ruptured.\"The bus batteries, presence of flammable furnishings in the bus and the cargo consisting of cell phones aggravated the fire leading to the tragic event,\" CNN News18 quotes Kurnool Superintendent of Police Vikrant Patel as saying. Meanwhile, P Venkataraman, the director-general of the Andhra Pradesh Fire Services Department, said electrical batteries used for the air conditioning system of the bus also exploded and made the fire worse. \"We saw bones and ash dropping through the melted sheets,\" he told local media.The smartphones were worth 4.6m Indian rupees (Â£39,361; $52,377) and were being sent from Hyderabad to an e-commerce company in Bengaluru, broadcaster NDTV reports.Most smartphones have lithium-ion batteries, which can pose a fire risk when damaged.This is because they can experience thermal runaway - uncontrollable temperature increases - which is hard to stop with conventional firefighting means. It can also spread to other batteries in close proximity.Authorities have opened an investigation into possible negligent driving over the crash. The bus driver fled the scene. The motorcyclist is said to be among the dead.Buses are a common mode of transport in India, but operators frequently ignore safety rules and overcrowd vehicles, while the nation had the highest road accident death tolls in the world last year.",

    "body": "Former Madagascan President Andry Rajoelina, who was ousted in a coup last week, has been stripped of his citizenship by the new regime.The order, signed by new Prime Minister Herintsalama Rajaonarivelo, cited local laws stipulating that people who acquired foreign citizenship should lose their Malagasy nationality.Rajoelina, 51, obtained French citizenship a decade ago, prompting calls for his disqualification from the 2023 presidential election. But he defied those calls and went on to win.He fled the African island nation after weeks of protests over persistent power and water shortages, culminating in a military takeover led by Col Michael Randrianirina.Rajoelina has said he has gone into hiding for his own safety, and his whereabouts remain unclear.When he disclosed his French nationality months before Madagascar's last presidential election, he argued he had only secretly acquired it to make things easier for his children studying in France.In recent weeks, he had faced demonstrations initially organised by youth movement Gen Z Mada and inspired by similar anti-government protests in Nepal, which were only exacerbated when his government responded with violence.Rajoelina sacked his energy minister and then his government - but this did little to quell the calls for him to step down.Protesters had hoped that Rajoelina would resign to pave the way for a smooth, democratic transition.Instead, he clung to power, eventually leading to Madagascar's elite military unit, of which Randrianirina was chief, to seize power.He has now been sworn in and has formed a new government, pledging to hold elections within two years.",

    "body": "A suspect has been arrested after footage which appears to capture the alleged attempted rape of a woman on a train near Paris went viral, local media say. Jhordana Dias, a 26-year-old Brazilian national, was allegedly attacked earlier this month. She told Le Parisien newspaper that the man boarded the train, pushed her and attempted to pull down her underwear. Alerted by her screams, another passenger pulled out her phone to film. The  footage captures a man fleeing as the train pulls into a station. The incident has revived discussions around women's safety in France.According to French media, a man was arrested on Friday evening by transport police in Mantes-la-Jolie, north-west of Paris. He was traced there by investigators, but it is unclear how.He was not carrying identity documentation at the time of his arrest, but told police he was a 26-year-old Egyptian national, media reports say. He remains in custody.The alleged incident took place on 15 October between the Choisy-le-Roi and Villeneuve-le-Roi train stations, south-east of Paris.The video shows shows a man dressed in a black tracksuit and cap onboard a carriage.Over the sound of a woman's cries, the woman filming can be heard saying \"you stay there\" as the man appears to begin approaching her.The train then pulls into a station, and the man disembarks and flees down the platform.The woman who filmed the incident, named in French media only as Marguerite, has since been widely credited as having saved Ms Dias from a more serious attack.Ms Dias, who does not speak French, reportedly filed a complaint with police in Choisy-le-Roi with the help of her brother, who translated her testimony.The footage has been widely circulated on news outlets and social media. prompting many women to share their own experiences of harassment on public transport in France.Two other women have since told Le Parisian that they had been victims of the same man.",

    "body": "Three people have been killed and at least 29 others injured in an overnight Russian air attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the city's mayor has said.Two high-rise residential buildings were hit in the strikes, Vitali Klitschko said, adding in a Telegram post that six children were among the injured.Meanwhile, Russian air defences destroyed a drone heading towards Moscow, according to the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin.The latest Russian bombardment comes as Moscow has stepped up attacks on civilian targets and energy infrastructure ahead of winter, with Ukrainian authorities saying nearly 1,200 drones have been launched in the past week alone.Officials in Kyiv said the three people were killed when a drone struck a nine-storey residential building in the Desnianskyi district to the north-west of the city, with 24 others injured in the same attack.Damage was also reported to at least three other residential buildings in Kyiv. Seven people including two children are being treated in hospital, officials said.Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022, and it currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.There has been marginal movement along the front lines as fighting on the ground continues, while Ukraine has sought to hurt Russia's warfighting ability by striking its military production plants and oil facilities that are essential to its economy.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently called on allies to supply his armed forces with long range weapons to continue doing so.However, he came away from a recent meeting at the White House and subsequent EU summit empty-handed.US President Donald Trump did announce new sanctions targeting Russia's largest oil companies this week - the first time he had done so in his current term - as did the EU.Trump said that talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin \"don't go anywhere\" as he shelved plans for the two to meet in Budapest over the war in Ukraine.On his way to Asia over the weekend, Trump said he had a \"great relationship\" with Putin but that recent events had been \"disappointing\", suggesting a meeting between the two was conditional on a peace deal being likely. Trump has appeared increasingly frustrated with Russian conditions for bringing the war to a close, with a summit in Alaska in August failing to yield any tangible results.The US president had previously said fresh sanctions on Moscow were contingent on European allies cutting their Russian energy imports. The EU has pledged to do so by 2028.Zelensky has agreed to a US proposal to cease fighting along the current front lines so peace negotiations can begin - though this falls short of Russian demands that Ukrainian forces completely withdraw from the eastern Donbas region.However, senior Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US officials in Washington on Friday and Saturday, told CNN that he believed Russia, Ukraine and the US were close to a diplomatic solution to end the war.\"It's a big move by President Zelensky to already acknowledge that it's about battle lines,\" Dmitriev said.\"You know, his previous position was that Russia should leave completely so actually, I think we are reasonably close to a diplomatic solution that can be worked out.\"",

    "body": "An unnamed donor is giving $130m (Â£100m) to the Pentagon to help pay US troops during the government shutdown, sparking ethics concerns. US defence officials confirmed the gift, which President Donald Trump said will make up for shortfalls in paying the country's 1.32m service members, but declined to identify the donor.Trump provided a few clues, though, saying on Saturday that he was \"a big supporter of mine\" and a US citizen.The government shut down more than three weeks ago, after lawmakers failed to approve a funding deal. The Trump administration paid troops last week by shifting $8bn from military research, but it is unclear what will happen on the next payday at the end of the month.Now in it's 25th day, the shutdown is poised to become one of the longest in US history.\"The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters on Friday, adding that the money was allowed under the department's \"general gift acceptance authority\".Trump had indicated a donation would be made on Thursday, while also declining to identify the donor, saying \"he doesn't really want the recognition\".However, the New York Times has identified the benefactor as Timothy Mellon, a billionaire and major financial backer of Trump.Mr Mellon is the heir to his influential family's $15bn (Â£11bn) fortune, according to Forbes, and was heavily involved in the US railway industry before recently becoming more politically active and donating $50m to a group supporting Trump.Before leaving for Asia on Saturday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the donor was a \"great gentleman\", a \"patron\", a \"patriot\" and a \"wonderful man\" who \"doesn't want publicity\".\"He prefers that his name not be mentioned, which is pretty unusual in the world I come from,\" Trump said. \"In the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.\" \"He put up $130 million in order to make sure - that's a lot of money - in order to make sure that the military got paid, and he's a big supporter of mine,\" he continued.The funds amount to around $100 per servicemember. While the White House was able to reallocate defence funds to pay troops last week, it remains to be seen what will happen on the next payday for the military, on  31 October. Congress has been unable to pass a bill that would keep troops being paid during the shutdown.Most government workers have been furloughed, or in some cases, told to work without pay while the shutdown lasts. According to Defence Department rules, donations over $10,000 must be reviewed by ethics officials \"to determine whether the donor is involved in any claims, procurement actions, litigation, or other particular matters involving the Department that must be considered prior to gift acceptance\".Donations from non-American citizens require additional scrutiny. While unusual, the Pentagon does sometimes accept gifts from donors, but they normally must be given to fund specific projects, such as a school, hospital, library, museum, or cemetery. Critics questioned why the US military would accept anonymous funds.  \"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" said Delaware Senator Chris Coons, the top Democrat on the Senate's defense appropriations subcommittee.",

    "body": "The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France after a spectacular daylight heist exposed woeful flaws in museum's security.On Friday a secret police escort oversaw the transfer of some of the remaining jewels to the Bank, 500m (about 500 yards ) from the museum, French media report.They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris. The vault is home to 90% of France's gold reserves, as well as the notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci and other national treasures. Its contents are worth an estimated â¬600m (Â£520m).The \"Souterraine\", as the vault is known, was designed to withstand all attacks, according to the bank's website.The main shaft is protected by a 50cm-thick, seven-tonne door made of flame-resistant concrete and reinforced with steel. Behind this door is a 35-tonne rotating concrete turret, which the bank says \"prevents any possibility of forced entry\".Last Sunday, masked thieves used an angle grinder to smash through a reinforced window into the Louvre's Gallery of Apollo, where France's crown jewels are kept.Within eight minutes, the gang seized treasures, including a necklace that belonged to Napoleon's wife Empress Marie-Louise and a diadem of Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugenie, worth â¬88m (Â£77m).The thieves used a mechanical ladder on the back of a lorry to lift them to a first-floor balcony to gain entry to the gallery.Interior Minister Laurent Nunez has said he has \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Although French ministers insist security at the museum had worked properly on the day, the Louvre director, Laurence des Cars, has spoken of weak and \"aging\" infrastructure.On Wednesday, des Cars told French lawmakers that the sole security camera monitoring the exterior wall where the break-in took place was facing the wrong way.",

    "body": "The US has placed sanctions on Colombia's President, Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\".The decision is the latest in a growing diplomatic dispute between the Latin American nation's first left-wing leader and his US counterpart Donald Trump.The two have clashed over US strikes on boats it says are being used to smuggle drugs, killing dozens including some Colombian nationals. Trump has said other nations had failed to stop the boats, while Petro has accused him of \"murder\".Colombia was once a close ally of Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter drug gangs.The US also trains Colombian narcotics agents - something the Trump administration has said it will continue to support.But in its sanctions decision, it singled out Petro as having presided over a \"disastrous and ineffective\" drug policy that had led to a large increase in cocaine production.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that since Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia had \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\".Sanctions have also been imposed on Colombia's Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, as well as Petro's wife and eldest son. All are barred from accessing assets and any properties they may have in the US. Petro responded that he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and that his administration had stemmed the growth of coca crops.\"What the US Treasury is doing is an arbitrariness typical of an oppressive regime,\" he said.Cocaine production is currently at record-high levels in Colombia, according to researcher HÃ©ctor Galeano from the Colombia-based Institute of Advanced Social and Cultural Studies of Latin America and the Caribbean.The US Treasury said that cocaine from Colombia was often purchased by Mexican cartels, which then smuggle it into the US.  The US says it is removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs, which grants it access to financial support. Colombia responded that it would cease buying weapons from the US.Petro has insisted that it was during the government of his predecessor, IvÃ¡n Duque, that the area planted with coca had increased.He has also said that, in order for coca cultivation to decrease, what was needed was for demand for cocaine to go down in the US and in Europe.His primary attempts to curb drug-related criminality in Colombia have centred on facilitating peace negotiations between warring cartels that have for decades brought violence to the nation.His campaign promise of bringing \"total peace\" to Colombia appears to be collapsing, with mounting attacks and stalled negotiations.Petro told BBC News in September air strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean were an \"act of tyranny\".He used a speech at the UN in New York around the same time to argue the attacks were not about controlling the drug trade but serving a need to use \"violence to dominate Colombia and Latin America\".Imposing sanctions on a head of state is rare but not unprecedented. The leaders of countries including Russia, North Korea and Venezuela have previously been sanctioned.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he would like to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his upcoming trip to Asia.\"I would. If you want to put out the word, I'm open to it,\" the US president told reporters onboard Air Force One as he departed for the region, adding that he \"had a great relationship\" with Kim. Trump made history during his first term, becoming the first sitting US president to set foot into North Korea when they last shook hands in 2019.His trip to Malaysia and Japan will see him meet a number of world leaders including China's Xi Jinping, amid trade negotiations sparked by Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs earlier this year.Trump has taken an atypical approach to North Korea - a secretive communist totalitarian state largely isolated on the world stage - and its attempts at creating nuclear weapons, initially taunting Kim as a \"little rocket man\".The pair met face-to-face three times during Trump's previous tenure in the White House but failed to agree a denuclearisation programme. North Korea has since conducted multiple tests of intercontinental missiles, its neighbours say.Asked if he would recognise North Korea as a nuclear state, Trump told reporters late on Thursday: \"I think they are sort of a nuclear power... They got a lot of nuclear weapons, I'll say that.\"Kim has said he was open to meeting Trump again, provided the US stopped pursuing its \"absurd\" demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. \"I still have a good memory of President Trump,\" Kim said in a speech last month, according to state media.Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this timeSouth Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, who handles relations between the North and South, said there was a \"considerable\" chance the two leaders might meet while Trump is in South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum, according to news agency AFP.A senior US official told reporters that a meeting was not in Trump's schedule, according to the Anadolu Agency - though their last meeting in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas came off the back of an invitation by Trump on social media.Trump's first stop will be in Malaysia, where he will attend Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit.He is expected to land in the South Korean city Busan on Wednesday ahead of the Apec summit. He will meet South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung, who discussed peace on the Korean peninsula and the possibility of a Trump-Kim meeting while visiting the White House in August.Lee told the BBC he was open to a deal between Trump and Kim in which North Korea agreed to freeze production of its nuclear weapons.Trump's meeting with China's President Xi comes on the backdrop of a trade war between the two nations.The two have agreed to hold off triple-digit tariffs threatened against one another while seeking a trade agreement - but that detente is in jeopardy after Trump said he would level a 100% trade levy on Chinese goods over Beijing's curbs on rare earth exports.The minerals are essential for many electronics and China is currently responsible for around 90% of exports of their refined form.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada by 10%, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan.The US president called the advert a \"fraud\" and lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship in a social media post on Saturday.Ontario's premier said he would take it down to allow trade talks with the US to proceed, after Trump withdrew - but that it would still run in the US over the weekend.Canada is the only G7 country that has not reached a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to charge steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Trump said while travelling to Asia on Saturday that he was \"increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now\". Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign products, not the exporters themselves.Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.US-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said of the tariff increase: \"We stand ready to build on the progress made in constructive discussions with American counterparts over the course of recent weeks.\"We will remain focused on achieving results that benefit workers and families in both the United States and Canada, and that progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration.\"Trump's decision comes after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause the anti-tariff advertising campaign \"so that trade talks can resume\", after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney.But he said it would still appear during games for the World Series, including between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.Trump responded that the advert should have been pulled down \"IMMEDIATELY\". A spokesperson for Ford stood by his statement on Friday.The advert, sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use the footage.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does however alter the order in which he made the comments.Ford had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.Both Trump and Carney will be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, but Trump told reporters accompanying him on Air Force One that he had no intention of meeting his Canadian counterpart during the trip. Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, told the BBC.The Reagan advert is not the only way that Ontario â home of the Toronto Blue Jays â is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series in a social media video on Friday.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers - who are based in Newsom's state - win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"",

    "body": "55 minutes agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondent, in Kuala LumpurIt was, as everyone knew it would be, all about US President Donald Trump.He literally towered over everyone else at the ceremony in Kuala Lumpur where Cambodia and Thailand signed their agreement. He gave the longest speech - and made the biggest claims.It was all superlatives. \"This is a momentous day for South East Asia,\" Trump said. \"A monumental step.\" Describing the two slightly sheepish-looking prime ministers who were about to sign the deal as \"historic figures\", Trump recalled at length how he got involved in the Thai-Cambodian border conflict while he was visiting his Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July.\"And I said this is much more important than a round of golf... I could have had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun... saving people and saving countries.\"Trump had asked for this special ceremony as a condition for coming to the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit - a gathering US presidents have attended at times in the past, but not always. And he used it to press his campaign to be recognised as a great peacemaker. \"The eight wars that my administration has ended in eight months â there's never been anything like that,\" he said. \"We're averaging one a month... It's like, I shouldn't say it's a hobby, because it's so much more serious, but something I'm good at and something I love to do.\"But what does the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord\", as Trump has renamed it, actually amount to?Remember, both countries signed a ceasefire back in July. That, too, was helped - or at least accelerated - by pressure from Trump. Looking at the details of the latest deal, though, it isn't much of leap forward.The two countries have agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed border and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it. They have a new procedure for clearing landmines, and will set up what they call a joint taskforce to address the proliferation of scam centres. They will replace missing border markers with temporary ones.This is progress - and Thai diplomats have told me they do feel Trump's involvement may help these agreements stick. But the historic differences over the border remain unresolved and are at risk of flaring up again.After the ceremony, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow refused to call it a peace agreement - sticking instead to their own preferred title \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\", which doesn't exactly trip off the tongue.\"I would call it a pathway to peace,\" was as far as Sihasak was willing to go - a far cry from Trump's expansive claims for it.\"It's an extremely slight agreement for the president of the United States to be presiding over,\" posted Sebastian Strangio, author and South East Asia Editor for the Diplomat magazine.Cambodia has been a lot more enthusiastic, but then it has always sought to internationalise its dispute with Thailand - referring it to the International Court of Justice - something Thailand does not agree with. At the ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet gushed with praise for the US president - reminding him that his government had nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charvirakul was more circumspect - mindful of nationalist pressure back home not to be giving too much away to Cambodia, a problem the authoritarian government in Cambodia does not have to worry about. Thailand has always insisted the dispute should be resolved bilaterally, with no outside mediation. It says it appreciates Trump's support, and describes the US and Malaysia as only \"facilitating\" this agreement.Neither country - nor the rest of Asean - could afford to spurn Trump's request for this ceremony. South East Asia is the most export-dependant region in the world, far more reliant on the US market than China. It has had a difficult year living under the existential threat posed by Trump's initial tariffs - up to 48% - and going through the nail-biting negotiations to bring them down to a more manageable 19-20%. Trump is not even staying for most of the Asean summit. After a couple of bilateral meetings and a dinner, he's off the Japan, and then to a Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting - another multilateral grouping at odds with his brutally transactional style, but where he hopes to reset relations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.But just having had the US president here in Kuala Lumpur for 24 hours will, Asean hopes, help restore some stability to their relationship.",

    "body": "Trump hopes China will help push Russia towards Ukraine peace talks19 hours agoTiffany WertheimerReutersTrump and Xi last met in person in 2019, during Trump's first term as presidentDonald Trump has said he would like China's help to deal with Russia as he seeks to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like China to help us out with Russia,\" the US president said on board Air Force One, as he flew to Asia for a whirlwind tour, where he will meet China's Xi Jinping in South Korea.It could be wishful thinking, however. China is Russia's biggest ally, and a vital support to Moscow since Western sanctions were imposed over its war in Ukraine.Trump's comments come off the back of a difficult week for Kyiv - the US refused to give it Tomahawk cruise missiles, EU leaders did not release frozen Russian cash to help fund its defence, and there have been more deadly strikes.Ending the Russia-Ukraine war has become a focal point for Trump in recent months, with a ceasefire deal so far eluding him, despite his campaign promises to solve the situation quickly. A summit with Putin in August failed to yield any tangible results, and Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Moscow.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" Trump said earlier this week.On Wednesday, he announced new sanctions against Russia's two biggest oil companies - the first direct interventions the Trump administration has imposed on Russia over the war. What effect the blacklisting will have in the long-term is yet to be seen, but the Kremlin said it was \"immune\" to the sanctions.What's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?While Trump's meeting with Xi on Thursday is still expected to focus on the hostile trade relations between the US and China, Trump said that he would talk to Xi about \"everything\", including the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like to see China help us out [with Russia]. I have a very good relationship... with President Xi. Very good,\" he said, adding that Xi wants to see the war end.Earlier this week, Trump said that the Chinese president \"can have a big influence on Putin\".SPUTNIK/KREMLIN POOL/EPA/ShutterstockPutin, Xi and Kim showed their solidarity when the three met in Beijing last monthBeijing has never criticised Russia's war in Ukraine, and has been accused by the US and its allies of aiding Russia's war effort - which Beijing denies - through its purchases of Russian oil and monthly supply of dual-use materials (those with both commercial and military applications).Putin and Xi have previously touted their countries' relationship as a \"friendship with no limits\", and Russia hopes gas exports to China and other countries will replace the revenue lost after Western sanctions were imposed.Xi, Putin and Kim show united front at huge Chinese military paradeRussia's Putin hails 'unprecedented' ties with China at talks in BeijingThe warm relations between Russia and China were on full display last month, when Putin, Xi and North Korea's Kim Jong Un met in Beijing for an extraordinary show of solidarity and military might.EPA/ShutterstockRussian strikes on Kyiv left killed several people and caused huge damage on SaturdayAs Trump made his comments on Air Force One, emergency crews in Ukraine were at the scene of more Russian strikes, including some in Kyiv where several people were killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\"No country should be left alone in the face of such evil,\" he wrote on Telegram, reiterating the need for Ukraine's allies to step-up support.Meanwhile, in Russia's Belgorod region, residents living near a dam were told to evacuate after a Ukrainian strike on the local reservoir caused damage that could lead to flooding.More on this story",

She passed away \"peacefully\" in a Bangkok hospital at 21:21 local time (14:21 GMT) on Friday, according to the Thai Royal Household Bureau.Sirikit had \"suffered several illnesses\" while in hospital since 2019, including a blood infection this month, it added.For more than six decades, Queen Sirikit was married to Thailand's longest-reigning monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016. In their globe-trotting heyday, she was seen as a style icon.King Vajiralongkorn has ordered that the Thai Royal Household Bureau organise a royal funeral, the statement added.Queen Sirikit's body will lie in state at the Grand Palace's Dusit Thorne Hall in Bangkok, it said.Thai royal family members will also observe a year of mourning.ReutersGetty ImagesQueen Sirikit (centre) married the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej (right) in 1950As a young queen, Sirikit was regarded as a fashion iconQueen Sirikit met her future husband, King Bhumibol, while studying music in Paris, where her father was at the time stationed as Thai ambassador to France.\"It was hate at first sight,\" she said in a 1980 BBC documentary about the Thai monarchy, Soul of a Nation, adding that he had arrived late to their first meeting. \"He said he would arrive at four o'clock in the afternoon. He arrived at seven o'clock, kept me standing there, practising curtsy and curtsy,\" she said.The couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before King Bhumibol was crowned in Bangkok.As a young couple in the 1960s, Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol travelled around the world, meeting famous faces including US President Dwight Eisenhower, the late Queen Elizabeth II and Elvis Presley.During that decade, she frequently made international best-dressed lists.In the rare 1980 interview with the BBC, she also described the relationship between the monarchy and people in Thailand, which continues to observe strict lese-majeste laws forbidding insult of the monarchy. She said: \"Kings and queens of Thailand have always been in close contact with the people and they usually regard the king as the father of the nation.\"That is why we do not have much private life, because we are considered father and mother of the nation.\"She was seen as a key maternal figure for the country, with her birthday, 12 August, marked as Mother's Day since 1976.In 2008, she attended the funeral of an anti-government protester killed in violent clashes with police. Queen Sirikit suffered a stroke in 2012, after which she was rarely seen in public.She is survived by her son and three daughters. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoFundanur Ozturk,BBC News Turkish and Kawoon Khamoosh,BBC World ServiceBBCTurkish charity owner Sadettin Karagoz denies allegations that he sexually assaulted refugees who came to him for aidA Turkish charity owner at the centre of sexual abuse allegations, brought to light by a BBC investigation, has been arrested.BBC News Turkish revealed accusations that Sadettin Karagoz sexually exploited vulnerable women, promising them aid in return for sex. He denies all the allegations.Mr Karagoz set up his charity in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in 2014. Syrian refugees desperate for help said at first he seemed like \"an angel\".One of them, Madina, fled the Syrian civil war in 2016 and said that two years later, one of her children became critically ill and her husband abandoned her. Her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.Left to care for three children alone, she went to Sadettin Karagoz's organisation, which translates as the Hope Charity Store. It gathers donations for refugees such as nappies, pasta, milk and clothes.Mr Karagoz's organisation is based in the Altindag area of Ankara, which is home to thousands of Syrian refugees\"He told me: 'When you have nowhere to go, come to me and I will look after you,\" she says.But when she did, Madina says he changed. She describes how Mr Karagoz told her to go with him to an area in the office behind a curtain to get some supplies.\"He grabbed me,\" she says. \"He started kissing meâ¦ I told him to get away from me. If I hadn't yelled, he would have tried to rape me.\"Madina describes how she escaped from the building but Mr Karagoz later went to her home.\"I didn't open the door because I was terrified,\" she says, explaining that he threatened to have her sent back to Syria.Scared of repercussions, Madina says she never went to the police and did not tell anyone else what had happened.Mr Karagoz says his organisation has given vital supplies such as rice, milk and tinned tomato paste to refugees over the past decadeMr Karagoz, a retired bank worker, denies the allegations and has told the BBC that his organisation has helped more than 37,000 people. He says that the aid distribution area in the charity is small, crowded and monitored by CCTV so he could not have been alone with any woman.Over the years, his charity has gained widespread recognition and won a local newspaper award in 2020. It has been featured on national TV, and he says it has attracted support from national and international organisations. In March this year he changed its Turkish name to My Home-meal Association.In all, three women, including Madina, told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had sexually assaulted and harassed them. Seven other people, including two former employees of his charity, say they either witnessed or heard first-hand testimony of him committing acts of sexual abuse between 2016 and 2024.Nada says she went to Mr Karagoz because her family desperately needed supportAccording to 27-year-old Syrian refugee Nada, he said he would only give her aid if she went to an empty flat with him. \"If you don't, I won't give you anything,\" she says Mr Karagoz told her. Again, her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.She was with her sister-in-law and says they stormed out. But desperate to provide for her family, she explains she didn't know where else to turn, so went back.On one occasion, Nada says Mr Karagoz took her behind a curtain to get nappies for her son where \"he tried to touch my breasts\".Another time, she says that \"he came from behind and grabbed my handâ¦ he forced me to touch his genitals\".Afraid of the stigma attached to sexual abuse and scared she would be blamed, Nada says she didn't feel she could tell anyone, even her husband.Batoul says an encounter with Mr Karagoz scared her and that afterwards she isolated herself at home and was afraid to open her door to anyone The third woman who told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had assaulted her is Batoul, who has since moved to Germany.A single mother, she too says she went to him for help. \"When I turned away to pick up the aid, he put his hands on my backside,\" she explains. \"I left the aid and walked out of the shop.\"These testimonies were not the first to surface against Mr Karagoz.In 2019 and 2025 he was accused of sexual harassment and assault, but on both occasions prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Police said neither victims nor witnesses were willing to come forward to make formal complaints.Some women told us they were afraid testifying could lead to them being harassed or deported.But after the BBC investigation, it is understood two other women came forward to report Mr Karagoz, and their testimony resulted in him being charged with sexual abuse. He is now in jail awaiting trial.Batoul says she is \"truly happy\" he has been arrested, \"for myself and for all the women who have suffered in silence and couldn't speak out because of fear\".She adds that she hopes it \"gives courage and strength to all women who are being exploited in any way\".Mr Karagoz says health conditions mean he is not able to engage in sexual activityBefore he was arrested, we put the allegations made by Madina, Nada, Batoul and charity workers to Mr Karagoz.He denied all the accusations and claimed if they were true, more women would have come forward.\"Three people, five people, 10 people [could complain]. Such things occur,\" he said. \"If you said 100, 200 [had accused me], then fine, then you could believe I actually did those things.\"He also said he had diabetes and high blood pressure and showed us a medical report with details of an operation in 2016 to remove his left testicle. This meant he was not able to perform any sexual activity, he said.However a professor of urology and specialist in men's sexual health, Ates Kadioglu, told the BBC that having one testicle removed \"doesn't affect someone's sex life\".We put this to Mr Karagoz who insisted that sexual activity was \"not possible for me\".We also put it to him that sexual assault may be motivated by a desire for power and control. He responded by saying: \"I personally don't have such an urge.\"\"All we did was good deeds and this is what we get in return.\"Sadettin Karagoz said women who accused him of assault in the past did so because he had reported them to the police for being involved in illegal activities.All the women we spoke to denied they or their relatives were involved with crime and the BBC has seen no evidence to suggest that they were.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship10 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the world's largest warship to be sent to the Caribbean.The USS Gerald R Ford can carry up to 90 aircraft and its deployment marks a massive increase in US firepower in the region.The US has conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the area as part of what it says is a war on drug traffickers. US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power. The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?The Pentagon said on Friday that the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations\", spokesman Sean Parnell said.Maduro accused the US of seeking \"a new eternal war\" in his address.\"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,\" he told state media.The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela, saying earlier this week that the US is \"looking at land now\" after getting \"the sea very well under control\".\"We stopped all drugs from coming in by sea. I will stop all drugs from coming in by land very shortly. You'll see that starting,\" he told reporters at the White House on Saturday before departing for a trip to Asia.The US has also bolstered its air presence in the region. BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.Secretary of State Marco Rubio played down the deployment to reporters on his plane flying to Qatar on Saturday, saying: \"We have deployed U.S. assets and interests all over the planet, but when we do it in our own hemisphere...everyone sort of freaks out.\"But he reiterated the Trump administration's view that Venezuela poses a serious threat to the US through the illegal drug trade.\"Unfortunately, the regime that governs, but is not the government of Venezuela, is a transshipment organization,\" he said.  \"They allow cocaine from Colombia and other places to be shipped through national territory â not just with the cooperation, but in many cases, with the participation of elements of this regime.\"Military analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says NicolÃ¡s MaduroOn Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed in an operation in the Caribbean.He said the boat had belonged to the Tren de Aragua - a transnational criminal organisation which has its base in Venezuela and has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the US State Department.The US air strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. \"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up was intended to \"strike fear\" into the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike was the latest the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean as well.At least 43 people have been killed.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic senators wrote to the White House, alleging the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval. Trump has said he has the legal authority to order the strikes.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC that the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has appeared unwilling to challenge. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group.  ",

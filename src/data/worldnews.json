    "body": "The Libyan army chief has been killed in an air crash in Turkey, Libya's prime minister has said.Gen Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad and four others were on board a Falcon 50 aircraft flying out of the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Tuesday evening.  In a post on X, Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said signal with the business jet was lost at 20:52 local time (17:52 GMT) - about 42 minutes after it took off from Ankara's airport. The Tripoli-bound jet had issued an emergency landing request before contact was lost. The aircraft's wreckage was later found south-west of Ankara, and an investigation is now under way into what caused the crash.In a later post on X, Yerlikaya wrote that police had spotted the debris near the village of Kesikkavak, in the Haymana district.He said the \"public will be informed of further developments\".In Libya, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, the prime minister of the country's internationally-recognised Government of National Unity (GNU), said he had received news of the deaths of Gen Haddad and other senior Libyan military officials on board the jet.The prime minister called it a \"great loss\" for the nation, saying Libya had \"lost men who served their country with sincerity and dedication\".Gen Haddad and his team had been in Turkey for talks aimed at further strengthening military and security co-operation between the two countries.Turkey has played an increasingly dominant role in Libya after intervening in 2019 to prevent an army from the east of the country driving out the internationally-recognised government in Tripoli, and has built close political, military and economic ties.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLana LamSydneyAustralian Federal PolicePolice arrested and charged the British man, 43, earlier this monthA British national in Australia has had his visa cancelled and faces deportation for allegedly displaying Nazi symbols.The 43-year-old man living in Queensland was arrested and charged earlier this month, after allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community.The man was taken into immigration detention this week in Brisbane and is due to face court in January. Police have been cracking down on the use of prohibited symbols amid a recent rise in antisemitism and right-wing extremism.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"He came here to hate - he doesn't get to stay.\"\"If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest,\" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Wednesday.Last month, Burke also revoked the visa of Matthew Gruter, a South African national who had been living in Australia since 2022, after he was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally in front of the New South Wales parliament. Like Gruter, the British man can appeal his visa being revoked. He can leave Australia voluntarily or wait to be deported to his home country. It is understood police are assessing whether to delay deporting the man so he can face court next month.The BBC has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment.Earlier this year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute.Police began investigating the British man in October over alleged posts on X. The social media platform blocked his account, prompting him to create a new one with a similar name where he continued posting offensive and harmful content, police said. Australian Federal PolicePolice seized weapons including axes and knives from the British man's homeAuthorities searched the man's home in Caboolture, on the outskirts of Brisbane, in late November and seized phones, weapons and several swords with swastika symbols. He was charged with three counts of displaying banned Nazi symbols and one count  of using the internet to cause offense.\"We want to ensure these symbols are not being used to fracture social cohesion,\" Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Nutt said earlier this month.  \"If we identify instances where this is happening, we will act swiftly to disrupt the behaviour, prosecute those involved and protect the dignity, safety and cohesion of our diverse community.\"",

When crews arrived, the building exploded causing a massive fire, authorities said.Five people were still unaccounted for, but officials said they were unsure if those people were in the building.Responders pulled residents out of windows, stairwells, and elevators and carried them to safety, fire chief Kevin Dippolito told reporters. \"There was one police officer who literally threw two people over his shoulders and ran\" with them towards medical staff, he said. Several people were trapped in the basement of the collapsed building but were rescued, Dippolito said.\"We're still in rescue mode. We have not transitioned into a recovery mode,\" he said.Emergency crews were still working to rescue people who may be stuck in the building, the fire chief said.Governor Josh Shapiro said the exact number of injuries was not yet known, and the cause of the blast remained under investigation.Images and videos posted on social platforms by local media outlets show a partially collapsed building with massive flames billowing out of it.Shapiro praised the support from authorities around the region who rushed to offer assistance, and said that the residents living near the nursing home were \"outstanding\". \"We had residents coming out of their houses offering to help us,\" he said. \"This is the Pennsylvania way: neighbors helping neighbors in a moment of need.\"",

    "body": "Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has been permitted to leave prison to undergo surgery on Christmas Day following approval from Brazil's Supreme Court, court documents show.Bolsonaro is currently serving a 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the last election in 2022.Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday granted permission for Bolsonaro to temporarily leave prison and be transferred to a hospital on Wednesday for a hernia operation on 25 December.Bolsonaro, 70, has faced ongoing health complications since being stabbed in the abdomen during a 2018 presidential campaign.In April, the right-wing former president underwent intestinal surgery. By November, Justice Moraes, who also oversaw his trial, mandated that Bolsonaro be given full-time medical care. Flávio Bolsonaro, the former president's son, posted a video to X on Wednesday with the caption: \"Keep praying for the president.\"Bolsonaro was found guilty in September for plotting a coup d'etat after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.The former leader is serving his sentence in a federal police jail in Brasilia, the capital, after being deemed a flight risk and removed from home detention.Earlier this month, tens of thousands of people in Brazil's main cities gathered to protest against a bill trying to significantly reduce the time Bolsonaro spends in jail.Lawmakers passed the bill last week after it was approved by the lower house. Legal experts have estimated it could reduce Bolsonaro's sentence to less than three years.  In response, Brazil's president Lula promised to veto the bill.\"With all due respect to the Congress, when it reaches my desk, I will veto it,\" Lula told journalists last week, while acknowledging his veto could be overridden by the largely conservative Congress.US President Donald Trump, who had previously called the investigation into Bolsonaro a \"witch hunt\", welcomed the bill being passed. The US also lifted sanctions that had been placed on Justice Moraes in July.",

They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger,\" they said.He was one of two police officers injured in the shooting, with the second officer Constable Scott Dyson, 25, still recovering from his injuries in hospital, according to the last police update.Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon visited Constable Hibbert in hospital, praising him as a \"positive young man\".Lanyon added that the force would rally around Constable Hibbert and find \"appropriate duties for him\" after his recovery.Police have alleged the suspected gunmen were inspired by Islamic State ideology and targeted the Jewish festival in what has been declared a terror attack.Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.On Monday, new court documents alleged the pair \"meticulously\" planned the attack for months, and two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.",

    "body": "16 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe US economy picked up speed over the three months to September, as consumer spending jumped and exports increased. The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years.The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending.But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America.Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\".\"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added.The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%.It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services.Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply,  bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints. Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the economy was well positioned as it headed into 2026, when it will start to feel the boost from tax cuts and the US central bank's recent moves to drop interest rates. \"Underlying measures are consistent with a solid expansion,\" he said. In a post on social media, Trump celebrated the figures, saying his tariffs were responsible. He has been on the defensive amid souring consumer confidence and polls indicating dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy.However, some analysts warned that rising prices faced by some households could  make it difficult to sustain the unusually strong pace of growth seen in the most recent quarter. Over the three months to September, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ticked up 2.8%, compared with 2.1% in the previous quarter, according to the report. Analysts have warned that those price increases are weighing on lower and middle income households, even as higher income households continue to spend freely. Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that some more recent surveys and credit card data suggest that households are reining in their spending. \"The weak labour market, stagnant real incomes, and exhaustion of pandemic-era excess savings all seem finally to be catching up with households,\" he said.

The incident in Plateau state is unrelated to the long-running Islamist insurgency in the country's north-east, where jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.The insecurity in Nigeria received renewed international attention in November after US President Donald Trump threatened to send troops to \"that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing'\". He alleged that Christians were being targeted.Nigeria's federal government has acknowledged the security problems but has denied that Christians are being singled out.On Monday, Information Minister Mohammed Idris said that recent tensions with the US over insecurity and alleged persecution of Christians had been \"largely resolved\", resulting in stronger relations with Washington.He added that trained and equipped forest guards will be deployed to secure forests and other remote areas used as hideouts by criminal groups to supplement army operations.Additional reporting by Abayomi Adisa and BBC Monitoring",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said the US will keep or sell the crude oil contained on tankers it has seized off the coast of Venezuela, as well as the vessels themselves.The US president's comments came as Washington continues to pressure the South American country's leader Nicolás Maduro to stand down.Speaking to reporters in Florida on Monday, Trump said of the oil \"we're going to keep it\", adding: \"Maybe we will sell it, maybe we will keep it. Maybe we'll use it in the Strategic Reserves. We're keeping the ships also.\"The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil revenues to fund drug-related crime, while Caracas has condemned the seizures as \"piracy\".The US military has seized two oil tankers this month, including one on Saturday.Trump issued his latest warning as the US Coast Guard continued to pursue a third oil tanker, which authorities described as part of a Venezuelan \"dark fleet\" used to evade US sanctions.\"It's moving along, and we'll end up getting it,\" Trump said. Separately on Monday, the US military said it carried out a strike on what it said was a suspected trafficking vessel in international waters in the eastern Pacific. US Southern Command said one person was killed.When asked whether the goal of the seizures was to force Maduro from power, Trump responded: \"Well, I think it probably would... That's up to him what he wants to do. I think it'd be smart for him to do that. But again, we're gonna find out.\"The US has been building up its military presence in the Pacific and Caribbean Seas and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.It has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.Speaking on Monday, Trump repeated that the US intends to strike targets on land too.He said: \"We'll be starting the same programme on land. If they want to come by land, they're going to end up having a big problem. They're going to get blown to pieces, because we don't want our people poisoned.\"Speaking on state television, Maduro responded to Trump by saying: \"He would be better off in his own country dealing with economic and social issues and the world would be better off if he focused on his own country's affairs.\"Since returning to office in January, Trump has doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture, accusing him of being \"one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world\".The Trump administration has designated Maduro's government as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO), and last week ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela.As the Venezuelan government relies heavily on oil exports to finance public spending, the latest measures have sparked outrage among officials in Caracas.At Venezuela's request, the UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss what the government has described as \"ongoing US aggression\".",

    "body": "UN experts and 400 prominent women have urged Iran not to execute Zahra Tabari, a 67-year-old electrical engineer and women's rights activist.Ms Tabari was arrested in April and accused of collaborating with a banned opposition group, the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran (PMOI), according to her family.In October, she was convicted of \"armed rebellion\" by a Revolutionary Court in Rasht after a trial via video link that lasted less than 10 minutes. Her family said the verdict was based on extremely limited and unreliable evidence: a piece of cloth bearing the words \"Woman, Resistance, Freedom\", and an unpublished audio message.Iranian authorities have not yet commented on the case.At least 51 other people are known to be facing the death penalty in Iran after being convicted of national security offences including armed rebellion, as well as \"enmity against God\", \"corruption on Earth\" and espionage, according to the UN experts.The UN Human Rights Council's special rapporteurs on human rights in Iran, violence against women and arbitrary executions, as well as the five members of the working group on discrimination against women and girls, warned in a joint statement that Ms Tabari's case showed \"a pattern of serious violations of international human rights law\".She was arrested during a raid on her home without a judicial warrant, and was interrogated for a month while held in solitary confinement and pressured to confess to taking up arms against the state and to membership in an opposition group, according to the experts.Ms Tabari was denied access to a lawyer of her choosing and was represented by a court-appointed lawyer, they said, adding that her death sentence was issued immediately after a brief hearing.\"The severe procedural violations in this case - including the unlawful deprivation of her liberty, the denial of effective legal representation, the extraordinarily brief trial, the lack of adequate time to prepare a defence, and the use of evidence that appears insufficient to support a charge of [armed rebellion] - render any resulting conviction unsafe,\" they said.They also noted that international law restricted the death penalty to the most serious crimes, meaning intentional killing.\"To execute Tabari under these circumstances would constitute arbitrary execution,\" the experts added. \"Criminalising women's activism for gender equality and treating such expression as evidence of armed rebellion constitutes a grave form of gender discrimination.\"More than 400 prominent women - including several Nobel laureates, the former presidents of Switzerland and Ecuador, and former prime ministers of Finland, Peru, Poland and Ukraine - also signed a public appeal for Ms Tabari's immediate release on Tuesday.\"Iran is today the world's number one executioner of women per capita. Zahra's case lays bare this terror: in Iran, daring to hold a sign declaring women's resistance to oppression is now punishable by death,\" it said.The appeal was organised by Justice for the Victims of the 1988 Massacre in Iran, a UK-based group that represents the families of the thousands of political prisoners who were executed in Iran three decades ago.Another Iranian woman, Kurdish rights activist and social worker Pakhshan Azizi, is also facing the death penalty on the same charge as Ms Tabari.UN experts have previously said Ms Azizi's sentencing appeared to be \"solely related to her legitimate work as a social worker, including her support for refugees in Iraq and Syria\".According to Iran Human Rights (IHR), at least 1,426 people - including 41 women - were executed in Iran in the first 11 months of 2025 - a 70% increase on the same period last year.Almost half of those put to death as of the end of November were convicted of drug-related offences, while 53 were convicted of national security offences, the Norway-based group said.",

    "body": "9 hours agoCachella SmithPA MediaAn email sent from an individual named \"A\", saying they are at Balmoral and asking Ghislaine Maxwell for \"inappropriate friends\", is among the latest tranche of Epstein files released on Tuesday.The message, sent to Maxwell on 16 August 2001, begins: \"I am up here at Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family.\" Later in the email, the sender asks: \"How's LA? Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" before signing off \"see ya A xxx\".Balmoral Castle is a royal residence.The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's team for a response. The former prince has previously denied all wrongdoing.He has also previously said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".The message was sent from email address \"abx17@dial.pipex.com\" entitled \"The Invisible Man\" and forms part of the more than 11,000 files published on Tuesday.In an email sent back to this address on the same day, Maxwell wrote: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\"US Department of JusticeA different email address - aace@dial.pipex.com - is listed in Epstein's phone book under a contact labelled \"Duke of York\", a previously released image showed.A further exchange between Maxwell and \"The Invisible Man\" also published on Tuesday shows the alias attached to both of the email addresses.The messages, sent in February 2002, discuss a trip to Peru.Maxwell initially forwarded an email to \"The Invisible Man\" at abx17@dial.pipex.com with details of plans for a visit to the South American country asking \"What do you think [?]\".The forwarded email comes from an address labelled \"Juanesteban Ganoza\" and makes suggestions on possible activities including a small lunch and horse riding.It also said: \"About the girls... how old is he? I doubt it that he will find someone here, but we can try.\"A reply from \"The Invisible Man\" is sent to Maxwell via the other address \"aace@dial.pipex.com\" with comments including: \"As far as food is concerned I am very easy and will fit in with whatever he plans […] As for girls well I leave that entirely to you and Juan Estoban!\"The sender signs off \"Masses of love A xxx\".In a later exchange, in March 2002, Maxwell forwards an email to aace@dial.pipex.com, which begins: \"Thought you would like to see what I sent.\"The email then appears to copy in a note sent to someone else beginning: \"I just gave Andrew your telephone no [sic].\"Some sight seeing some 2 legged sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun and from good families) and he will be very happy.\"US Department of JusticeIn October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his prince and Duke of York titles following scrutiny over his links with Epstein.The US Department of Justice has been releasing documents, known as the Epstein files, relating to two criminal investigations into the convicted sex offender during his lifetime.Congress passed a law mandating the files be released in their entirety by 19 December.Not all the files have yet been released.Andrew has been referenced in previous documents. Simply appearing in the photos or documents is not itself evidence of wrongdoing.Also among the newly released documents is a formal request from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) dating to April 2020 asking for assistance from the British authorities \"to interview H.R.H Prince Andrew Albert Christian Edward\" relating to two criminal investigations. One of the two related to Epstein. On the Epstein investigation, the DOJ's note reads \"the investigation to date has revealed that Prince Andrew may have been a witness to and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation\".The document also underlined that Andrew was not a \"target\" of the investigation and no evidence had been gathered that he had committed any crime under US law.Attached to the document is a list of areas the US authorities had sought to cover in an interview - it included names and identifying features of any females Prince Andrew met through Epstein and/or Maxwell as well as the history of his relationship with both.US President Donald Trump has also featured in documents within this latest release including a reference in a 2020 email from an assistant US attorney which suggested he had travelled on Epstein's private jet \"many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)\".In 2024, Trump wrote: \"I was never on Epstein's Plane\". He has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The DOJ has also said some files released on Tuesday \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" against Trump.",

    "body": "13 hours agoAlex Smith and Jaroslav LukivandMohamed Madi,KyivReutersSiversk has been virtually wiped out as a town during many months of heavy fightingUkrainian troops have withdrawn from the embattled eastern town of Siversk, as Russia continues its steady - albeit slow - advance.The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday it acted \"to preserve the lives of our soldiers and the combat capability of units\", adding that Russian forces had a \"significant advantage in manpower\".The capture of Siversk brings Russia closer to the last remaining \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk still in Ukrainian hands in the industrial Donetsk region.Earlier in the day, officials said three people - including a young child - were killed in massive overnight Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine.Watch: BBC correspondent at the scene of Kyiv drone attackRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In a statement, the Ukrainian military said Russian troops were continuing \"active offensive actions\" in the Siversk area \"despite significant losses\".It added that Ukrainian \"defence forces had exhausted the enemy during the fighting for Siversk\".Before the Russian invasion, Siversk had about 11,000 people.Two weeks ago Russia had already reported control over the town - but Ukraine denied the claim at the time.Siversk has been virtually wiped out as a town during many months of heavy fighting.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The regions are collectively known as Donbas.Russian leader Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from all of Donbas or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been under heavy pressure from his US counterpart Donald Trump to cede all of Donbas to Russia during ongoing Washington-led peace negotiations.Zelensky has so far rejected any territorial concessions, and instead demanded iron-clad security guarantees for Ukraine in any potential settlement.The peace negotiations - involving separate meetings of US officials with their Ukrainian and Russian counterparts - continued over the weekend but no breakthrough was reported.According to Zelensky, the US had proposed a Christmas truce but Russia rejected the idea.Overnight, Russia launched 635 drones and 38 missiles on a number of Ukrainian regions, Ukraine's air force said, adding that 621 of them were downed.Local authorities in the central Zhytomyr region confirmed a child's death.Regional head Vitaly Bunechko said the child \"was taken to hospital, doctors fought for (the child's) life but could not save (the child) in the end\". Five others were injured in the strike, he added.Meanwhile, a 76-year-old woman was killed and three people injured when a house in the Kyiv region was struck, according to Ukraine's state emergencies service.An attack in Khmelnytskyy, western Ukraine, killed a 72-year-old, regional administration head Serhiy Tyurin said.Polish fighter jets were scrambled in response to missiles and drones targeting west Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry said it had targeted Ukrainian \"military-industrial complex plants and supporting energy facilities\". It added that all the designated targets had been hit.Meanwhile, Ukraine reportedly struck a petrochemical plant in Stravropol, southern Russia.Videos shared by Russian media channels online showed large flames rising from the direction of the plant.The region's governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said a Ukrainian drone hit the plant and sparked a fire. No casualties were reported and residential buildings were left undamaged.Oleksandr Chyrvonyi, who lives in the city of Zaporizhzhia close to the front line,  told the BBC that Monday night was \"an extremely unpleasant experience\".\"I had four or five hours' sleep - there were constant notifications waking me up that drones and cruise missiles were coming,\" he said, adding that most went past his city to western and central regions. Power cuts are the new normal. Zaporizhzhia has around 10 hours of electricity out of 24, he said.There is a \"general feeling of the lack of civilisation\", he continued, but said he tries to have \"an illusion of a normal life\".ReutersEmergency responders work at the site of a Russian drone strike on an apartment building in the Ukrainian capitalWith temperatures expected to fall to as low as -7C on Wednesday, Ukraine's energy operator warned of emergency power shutdowns \"in all regions\" and urged people to use energy \"sparingly\". Acting energy minister Artem Nekrasov said it was the ninth large attack on Ukraine's energy system this year, and that supply in the Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions has been \"almost completely\" lost.Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Merezhko told the BBC World Service that some areas could be without power \"for days\".In the Ukrainian capital, many suspect the overnight attack is linked to Monday's killing of a top Russian general after a car bomb exploded in Moscow.Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov - the head of the armed forces' operational training department - died in the blast, which Russia has blamed on Ukraine. Kyiv has not commented.Additional reporting by Gabriela Pomeroy ",

    "body": "8 hours agoLebo DisekoGlobal Religion correspondent Getty ImagesPope Leo has criticised the Trump administration's immigration policyJesse Romero, a conservative Catholic podcaster, has some choice words for Pope Leo XIV.\"The Pope should tell us how to get to heaven,\" says Romero. \"He has no authority over the government; he has to stay in his lane.\"As a Donald Trump supporter, he is angry about criticism made by the American-born Pope and US bishops about his mass deportation policy. With one in five Americans identifying as Catholic, the Church plays an important role in American life - and politics.Catholics like Vice President JD Vance, and influential legal activist Leonard Leo, were an important part of Donald Trump's electoral success. They are at the heart of the cabinet too, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon holding key offices.But the issue of immigration has become a faultline between Church leadership and the government, as well as amongst parishioners themselves.When cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in May, Romero had hoped for a \"Trump-like Pope,\" with a similar outlook to the president.Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years. It was backed by the Pope, who called the statement \"very important\" and urged all Catholics and \"people of goodwill, to listen carefully\" to it.Getty ImagesChicago has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcementPicking a fight with the Pope\"I think the relationship is quite tense,\" says David Gibson, director of Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture.Conservatives had hoped that Pope Leo would bring a change from his predecessor Pope Francis's focus on issues of social justice and migration, according to Gibson. \"Many of them are angry. They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute. That figure is around 30% for Hispanics, who are 37% of the US Catholic population.Getty ImagesUS Vice President JD Vance has been vocal about how his Catholic faith has influenced his politicsThe growing power and prominence of right-wing Catholics in the political sphere is exemplified by JD Vance, a convert to the religion who says his politics are shaped by his faith. Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The goal, she says, \"was to bring Communion to people inside, to minister to them, which is something that used to be allowed and is not being allowed\".The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry.\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee. St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"Getty ImagesClergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility'Inconsistent with the Gospel'Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. Just five bishops voted against it and three abstained.\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.\"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\"He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching.\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect. Everybody else, we've got to pray for each other.\"",

Despite immediate rescue efforts, the three individuals were found dead,\"  a police statement said.The fatalities follow a deadly week in the alps.Last weekend in France, six skiers died after being caught in avalanches in various Alpine resorts and in western Austria, a 58-year-old skier died in in the Tyrolean resort of Weerberg.On Tuesday, an avalanche killed a 13-year-old Czech boy skiing in Austria's Bad Gastein resort.And in neighbouring Switzerland, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing on Friday.",

    "body": "5 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan CorrespondentandDearbail Jordan,Reporter Watch: Firefighters battle deadly blaze at Karachi shopping centreA fire at a shopping centre in the Pakistan city of Karachi has killed six people as firefighters continue to battle the blaze.Parts of the Gul Plaza, containing 1,200 stores and spanning 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft), have collapsed which officers said was hampering rescue efforts.One firefighter is among the dead, more than 20 people have been injured and there are fears some are still trapped inside the multi-storey mall.Local emergency services said that when helpers arrived at the site on Saturday \"the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames\".A senior police official told the BBC that the authorities had been unable to search the building for bodies as the fire has continued to burn. More than 30 people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing.Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further.Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the shopping centre contains flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, carpets and perfume. Summaiya Syed, Karachi's police surgeon, said six bodies had been transferred to the city's Civil Hospital as well as some of the injured.She added that the police were \"invoking mass disaster protocols\".Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.",

I will be more careful with my words and behaviour,\" Yamanaka said.He said those comments were made during discussions over personnel evaluations.However, the mayor denied other accusations, including insulting colleagues' appearance.Yamanaka said an investigation was being considered under the supervision of the deputy mayor, adding that he would co-operate \"sincerely\" if an investigation takes place.In response, Kubota insisted Yamanaka had made the comments he has not admitted to, saying: \"The mayor doesn't understand anything. I cannot accept that as an apology. I want him to change.\"More from the BBC",

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US President Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.On Friday, Judge Katherine Menendez ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

    "body": "The Syrian government has announced an immediate nationwide ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), taking almost full control of the country, according to Syrian state media.The ceasefire ends nearly two weeks of fighting and forms part of a broader 14-point agreement that will see the SDF integrated into Syria's military and state institutions.Speaking in Damascus, President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to reassert control over three eastern and northern governorates - al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa. The announcement followed a meeting between al-Sharaa and the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Damascus. Barrack praised the agreement as a step toward a \"unified Syria.\"SDF commander Mazloum Abdi was expected to attend the meeting but was unable to travel due to weather conditions, with his visit postponed until Monday, al-Sharaa said.Kurdish-led forces established their autonomous administration during Syria's civil war, almost a decade ago, with strong backing from the United States, which armed and trained the SDF as its main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group (Isis). With US military support, the SDF drove Isis from much of northeastern Syria and went on to govern both Kurdish and Arab-majority areas.Under the agreement, signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi, Syrian authorities will take over civilian institutions, border crossings and oil and gas fields that have underpinned Kurdish self-rule. SDF military and security personnel will be integrated into Syria's defence and interior ministries following vetting, while Damascus will assume responsibility for prisons and detention camps holding tens of thousands of foreign Isis fighters and their families.Damascus also reiterated pledges to recognise Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, including giving Kurdish official language status and marking the Kurdish new year as a national holiday - the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence from France in 1946.The agreement also reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State.The deal follows months of stalled negotiations after a previous integration effort failed and comes after Syrian government forces moved into Raqqa and nearby oil facilities following an SDF withdrawal earlier on Sunday.Al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.",

At least 20,000 have been evacuated. The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.Local media show pictures of charred cars in the streets. Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought.Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling a total of 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío.\"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe\" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X. \"All resources are available,\" he added.The fires have affected 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) in the two regions so far, local media say.The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000.Strong winds have fanned the flames amid summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts.Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the next two days.Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a meeting with his top advisers to discuss Donald Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, after it revealed the US did not include Israel in talks to do with its creation.Netanyahu's office said it was \"not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy\", following Saturday's announcement of the committee's Gaza Executive Board, which includes the Turkish foreign minister and a Qatari official, as well as former-UK PM Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.The Board of Peace, which is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war, is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza and manage its reconstruction. Its exact structure remains unclear and members are still being invited.Two separate senior bodies have been officially unveiled, both of which sit under the main Board of Peace.One is a \"founding Executive Board\", with a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. The other, the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).So far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: \"The Gaza Strip does not need any \"administrative committee\" to oversee its \"rehabilitation\" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists\".Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a \"diplomatic failure for Israel.\"Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel.The overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said.While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited.Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role.The White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\".The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC.On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute billion dollars ($1bn; £745m) to join the panel.Speaking to CBS news , a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything. Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Sunday, he made clear that Canada did not have \"unimpeded\" aid funds to cover the costs of membership.  Meanwhile, the United Nations warned on Saturday that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is \"far from over\". The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter.Olga Cherevko from the UN aid coordination office said that the delivery of tonnes aid and fixed roads in the months since a ceasefire came into effect were a \"band aid\" rather than a solution. Bitter winter weather has led to further complications, destroying buildings and making it difficult to access healthcare. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.",

    "body": "24 hours agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", and blamed the US for the deaths.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.\"Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand,\" Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media.\"We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation.\"The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "2 days agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoGoogle has appealed a US district judge's landmark antitrust ruling that found the company illegally held a monopoly in online search.\"As we have long said, the Court's August 2024 ruling ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they're forced to,\" Google's vice president for regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said.In its announcement on Friday, Google said the ruling by Judge Amit Mehta didn't account for the pace of innovation and intense competition the company faces.The company is requesting a pause on implementing a series of fixes - viewed by some observers as too lenient - aimed at limiting its monopoly power.Judge Mehta acknowledged the rapid changes to the Google's business when he issued his remedies in September, writing that the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) had changed the course of the case.He refused to grant government lawyers their request for a Google breakup that would include a spin-off of Chrome, the world's most popular browser.Instead, he pushed less rigorous remedies, including a requirement that Google share certain data with \"qualified competitors\" as deemed by the court.That data was due to include portions of its search index, Google's massive inventory of web content that functions like a map of the internet.The judge also called for Google to allow certain competitors to display the tech giant's search results as their own in a bid to give upstarts the time and resources they need to innovate.On Friday, Mulholland balked at being forced to share search data and syndication services with rivals as she justified the request for a halt to implementing the orders.\"These mandates would risk Americans' privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products — ultimately stifling the innovation that keeps the U.S. at the forefront of global technology,\" Mulholland wrote.While the company has invested growing sums of cash into AI, those ambitions have come under scrutiny.Last month, the EU opened an investigation into Google over its AI summaries which appear above search results.The European Commission said it would probe whether Google used data from websites to provide the service and failed to offer appropriate compensation to publishers.Google said the investigation risked stifling innovation in a competitive market.This week, Google parent Alphabet became the fourth company ever to reach a market capitalisation of $4tn.",

The Iranian government has called the protests \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies. The demonstrations started over the economy on 28 December and turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersMette Frederiksen and other European allies are standing in solidarity with Greenland, despite Trump's threat of tariffsDenmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says \"Europe won't be blackmailed\", as she and other European leaders continue to weigh their response to US President Donald Trump's tariff threats over Greenland.Trump says he will impose new taxes on eight US allies - Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK - in February if they oppose his proposed takeover of the autonomous Danish territory.He insists Greenland is critical for US security and has not ruled out taking it by force - a move that has drawn widespread criticism. The countries threatened with tariffs have now issued joint statement, saying Trump's plan risks a \"dangerous downward spiral\".\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations,\" they said, reiterating that they \"stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland\".The countries stressed they are \"committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest\" as members of the Nato military alliance. \"We stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement reads. Separately, Frederiksen wrote on Facebook: \"We want to cooperate and we are not the ones seeking conflict. And I am happy for the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed.\"\"It is all the more important that we stand firm on the fundamental values that created the European community.\"It came as EU members held an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday. Why does Trump want Greenland and what could it mean for Nato?Faisal Islam: Trump's Greenland threats to allies are without parallelTrump has threatened to impose a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland, which would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached.\"These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,\" he wrote, adding: \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security and Survival of our Planet\".The US president insists Greenland is critical for US security and has said previously that Washington would get the territory \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\".Greenland is a sparsely populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday told NBC News' Meet the Press that \"Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the US, and it will not need to be defended if it is part of the US\".\"I believe that the Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe and best for the United States,\" he said.It is still unclear how the tariffs will affect those Trump has already imposed on the UK and EU. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is working to co-ordinate the European response to the tariff threats, said he would request that the EU activate its \"anti-coercion instrument\" if Trump does impose them. The US president is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday on the theme \"how can we co-operate in a more contested world?\" Macron, as well as the leaders of Germany and the EU, will also be attending the annual conference. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who will also be there, said his country was \"concerned by the recent escalation\" and that it would be \"significantly increasing Arctic security — strengthening our military and investing in critical infrastructure\".\"Canada strongly believes that the best way to secure the Arctic is by working together within Nato,\" he also wrote on X.The head of Nato, Mark Rutte, meanwhile, said he had spoken to Trump \"regarding the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic\".\"We will continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing him in Davos later this week,\" he added. EPA/ShutterstockProtests were held over the weekend in both Denmark and GreenlandPublic anger in both Denmark and Greenland at Trump's threats over Greenland appears undiminished. Demonstrations against Trump's takeover plans were held in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, on Saturday - before the tariff announcement - as well as in Danish cities. These rallies coincide with a visit to Copenhagen by a delegation from the US Congress. Its leader, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, described Mr Trump's rhetoric as \"not constructive\".The island's representative to the US has said that the last time Greenlanders were asked if they wanted to be part of the US, in January 2025, only 6% were in favour of doing so, while 85% were against.A recent poll suggests that most Americans also oppose US control of Greenland. A Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was released last Wednesday, indicated just 17% of Americans support the US taking Greenland, compared to 47% who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island.",

    "body": "Ugandan leader extends 40-year rule after winning contested poll1 day agoAnita Nkonge,BBC Africa,Damian ZaneandLucy FlemingAFP via Getty ImagesYoweri Museveni first came to power in 1986 as a rebel leaderUgandan President Yoweri Museveni has been declared the winner of Thursday's election extending his four decades in power by another five years.He gained 72% of the vote, the election commission announced, against 25% for his closest challenger Bobi Wine, who has condemned what he described as \"fake results\" and \"ballot stuffing\".Wine has not provided any details and the authorities have not responded to his allegations, but African Union election observers said they saw \"no evidence of ballot stuffing\". Wine has called for non-violent protests.Museveni, 81, first came to power as a rebel leader in 1986 but since then has won seven elections. The election process was marred by violence and Wine, a 43-year-old former pop star, says that at least 21 people have been killed around the country in recent days.The authorities have so far confirmed seven deaths.Announcing the results, electoral commission head Simon Byabakama asked supporters of both factions to embrace unity and accept the results.Beyond the national tallying centre, there have been minimal celebrations, with most roads in the capital, Kampala, empty and businesses closed.However, pockets of violence have been reported in several neighbourhoods.Access to the internet has been cut in the country since Tuesday, making it hard to verify information.The authorities say the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as \"deeply worrying\".Wine has demanded that the internet be restored.ReutersSpeaker of Parliament Anita Among celebrated Yoweri Museveni's victory at the electoral commissionLeading the African Union observer mission, Nigeria's former President Goodluck Jonathan told journalists that \"the government should refrain from the suspension of internet access\" close to the election.He also denounced \"reports of intimidation, arrest and abductions\" saying they \"instilled fear and eroded public trust in the electoral process\", AFP news agency reports.Speaking to the BBC, Wine's assistant Dan Magic alleged that security personnel entered the opposition leader's home on Thursday night in order to take him. It is not clear what happened next, but Magic said that Wine's whereabouts were unknown.Wine had previously said he was under house arrest. On Saturday, he posted a statement on Facebook saying he had evaded an attempt to seize him.This has not been confirmed by the police but spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said  the politician's movements had been restricted because his home was an area of \"security interest\".\"We have controlled access to areas which are security hotspots,\" Uganda's Daily Monitor paper quoted him as saying.\"We cannot allow people to use some places to gather and cause chaos,\" he said.Wine says he represents the youth in a country where most of the population is aged under 30. During the campaign, he promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argued that he was the sole guarantor of stability in Uganda, a country with a history of conflict.There were six other candidates but none got more than 2% of the vote. Turnout was 52.5%.The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters.Rusoke, the police spokesperson, dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters of being disruptive.Additional reporting by Joseph Winter and Sammy Awami in KampalaMore about Uganda from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "14 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorGetty ImagesProtests in support of Greenland took place in Denmark on SaturdayUS President Donald Trump's apparently coercive threat to force Western allies not to oppose his proposed annexation of Greenland, or face further damage to their trade with the US, is without both parallel and precedent.We've had some unusual and unexpected economic threats from President Trump over the past year, but I think it is safe to say this exceeds all of them, and takes us into both surreal and utterly dangerous territory.If taken at face value, it is a form of economic war being levied by the White House on its closest allies.That's because it targets allies at incredibly short notice and for a cause that essentially could break up Nato and the western alliance.This will be leaving officials from those countries absolutely baffled. In fact, it's so outlandish that they may indeed be more baffled than angry.Nobody in the world would assume that a threat like this - based on acquiring the land of your ally - would ever actually happen. Does Trump really have the backing in the US, in Congress, even in his own administration to do this?Is this, as some trade officials have to assume, the biggest TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) of all time? These things can come and go and, economically, these countries have handled the damage so far.Greenland: 'Diplomatic channels are the way to go', US speaker tells BBCThink of Canada. It has seen its trade with the US slump. But its Prime Minister Mark Carney's strategy has seen Canada's trade surge with the rest of the world by 14% - which amazingly is worth more than what was needed to cover its trade lost with the US.Carney has been in China this week pushing \"a new world order\" and pursuing more trade with China, not the detachment sought by some US administration officials.\"This is China versus the world,\" the Trump administration was trying to persuade the rest of the world just three months ago.Carney is showing up this approach, something which is perhaps notable background context for the timing of today's intervention.If, however, we do take Trump's latest threats seriously, they are extremely troubling.Not so much because of the 10% tariff, but because of its rationale - taking land from an ally, and the act of publicly trying to coerce your allies. How would the world react if China or Russia had sent a threat like this to some of their allies?The basis of the threat is clearly deeply worrying.Many in capitals around the world will read Trump's social media announcement and question the functioning of American decision making.President Trump arrives to meet leaders of the allied countries whose economies he has just threatened at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.Most of the world will hope that, by that time, this unparalleled threat will have somehow disappeared.Click here or use the form below.

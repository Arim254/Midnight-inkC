    "body": "7 hours agoHelen LivingstoneAFP via Getty ImagesAt least 15 people have been confirmed dead in Sunday's shooting attack at Bondi beach.Many were attending an event to mark the first day of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.Authorities have confirmed that two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl were among the victims. This is what we know about those identified so far: Matilda, 10Ten-year-old Matilda was described as a bright and joyful childAuthorities have confirmed that a 10-year-old girl, named by her family as Matilda, was among the dead.Her parents attended a vigil on Tuesday to honour her and the others killed at Bondi. The family moved to Australia from Ukraine and Matilda was their first born in the country.Recalling the deadly attack, the 10-year-old's mother said the alleged gunman \"just pulled his trigger on her... it wasn't just a bullet from a stray - it wasn't an accident\".Irina Goodhew, who organised a fundraiser for the girl's mother and said she was the child's former teacher, wrote: \"I knew her as a bright, joyful, and spirited child who brought light to everyone around her.\"The Harmony Russian School of Sydney also confirmed that she was one of its students.\"We are deeply saddened to share the news that a former student of our school has passed away in the hospital due to injuries sustained from a gunshot,\" the school wrote on Facebook. \"Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to her family, friends, and everyone affected by this tragic event … Her memory will remain in our hearts, and we honor her life and the time she spent as part of our school family.\"Meanwhile her aunt spoke to ABC news and said that Matilda's sister, who was with her when she was shot, was struggling to come to terms with the loss.\"They were like twins — they've never been separated,\" she told the ABC.Rabbi Eli SchlangerSuppliedEli Schlanger was known as the Bondi rabbiKnown as the \"Bondi Rabbi\", Eli Schlanger, 41, was one of the key organisers of Sunday's event. He was head of the local Chabad mission, an international Hasidic Jewish organisation based in Brooklyn.The death of the British-born father of five was confirmed by his cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis. \"My dear cousin, Rabbi Eli Schlanger @bondirabbi was murdered in today's terrorist attack in Sydney,\" Zalman wrote on Instagram. \"He leaves behind his wife & young children, as well as my uncle & aunt & siblings … He was truly an incredible guy\".In a post on its website, Chabad said Schlanger's youngest child was just two months old.\"He was the most godly, humane, kind, gracious human being I think I've ever met,\" Alex Ryvchin of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told reporters at Bondi on Monday morning. Rabbi Schlanger's funeral will take place on Wednesday, Chabad confirmed.Dan ElkayamRockdale Ilinden FCMr Elkayam was described by Rockdale Ilinden FC as an \"extremely talented and popular figure\"The death of French national Dan Elkayam was confirmed by France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot. \"It's with immense sadness that we have learnt that our compatriot Dan Elkayam was among the victims of the terrorist attack that hit Jewish families gathered on the beach at Bondi in Sydney,\" he wrote on social media. \"We mourn with his family and loved ones, with the Jewish community and the Australian people.\" According to his LinkedIn profile, Elkayam worked as an IT analyst for NBCUniversal and had moved to Australia last year.He was also a keen footballer, and \"an integral member\" of our premier league squad, the Rockdale Ilinden Football Club in west Sydney wrote on its Facebook page. He was \"an extremely talented and popular figure amongst team mates. Our deepest and sincerest condolances to Dan's family, friends and all that knew him. He will be missed,\" the club wrote. How Bondi Beach shooting unfolded minute by minuteAlexander KleytmanAlexander Kleytman was a Holocaust survivor who came to Australia from Ukraine. \"I have no husband. I don't know where is his body. Nobody can give me any answer,\" his wife Larisa Kleytman told reporters outside a Sydney hospital late on Sunday.\"We were standing and suddenly came the 'boom boom', and everybody fell down. At this moment he was behind me and at one moment he decided to go close to me. He pushed his body up because he wanted to stay near me,\" she told Australian media.Chabad wrote on X that Alexander \"died shielding her from the gunman's bullets. In addition to his wife, he leaves behind two children and 11 grandchildren.\"The couple shared some of their life story with Jewish Care Australia in 2023.\"As children, both Larisa and Alexander faced the unspeakable terror of the Holocaust,\" the health organisation wrote in its annual report.\"Alex's memories are particularly harrowing; recalling the dreadful conditions in Siberia where he, along with his mother and younger brother, struggled for survival.\"Boris and Sofia GurmanGoFundMeThe family of Boris and Sofia Gurman confirmed the couple, who had been married for 34 years, were killed on Sunday.Widely-circulated dashcam footage showed Mr Gurman wrestling with one of the alleged gunmen during the early stages of the attack and taking the weapon off him, before they both fall onto the road.Mr Gurman, 69, is then seen getting up before appearing to hit the attacker with the gun. The attacker is then thought to have got another gun which he used to kill them.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr and Mrs Gurman's family said they had \"become aware of footage showing Boris, with Sofia by his side, courageously attempting to disarm an attacker in an effort to protect others\".\"While nothing can lessen the pain of losing Boris and Sofia, we feel an overwhelming sense of pride in their bravery and selflessness. \"This encapsulates who Boris and Sofia were - people who instinctively and selflessly tried to help others,\" the family added.The Gurman couple were looking forward to celebrating Mrs Gurman's 62nd birthday on Wednesday, 17 December. Their 35th wedding anniversary was also approaching in January, the family said.\"Boris and Sofia were devoted to their family and to each other.

She met prejudice with principle, and division with service,\" her family said in a statement quoted by ABC News.She was vice-president of the New South Wales branch of international Jewish group B'nai B'rith, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.B'nai B'rith reportedly confirmed Brutman's death in a statement to members, calling her a \"gracious woman and a devoted member\" of the group.\"She was a very clever lady, and she was very, very passionate about dealing with prejudice and discrimination.

    "body": "21 hours agoLaura GozziFootage supplied by the team of scientists show the scale of the footprints and a recreation of how they were formedThousands of dinosaur footprints dating back 210 million years have been found in a national park in northern Italy.The footprints - some of which are up to 40cm (15in) in diameter - are aligned in parallel rows, and many show clear traces of toes and claws. It is thought the dinosaurs were prosauropods - herbivores with long necks, small heads and sharp claws. \"I never would have imagined I'd come across such a spectacular discovery in the region where I live,\" said Milan-based paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso.Illustrazione di Fabio Manucci, Arch. PaleoStelvioArtist's rendition of a herd of prosauropods walking across a muddy plain during low tide. Smaller footprints suggest the herd also included young specimensLast September a photographer spotted the footprints stretching hundreds of metres on a vertical mountain wall in the Stelvio national park, north-east of Milan.In the Triassic period - between about 250 and 201 million years ago - the wall was a tidal flat, which later became part of the Alpine chain.\"This place was full of dinosaurs; it's an immense scientific treasure,\" Mr Dal Sasso said.The herds moved in harmony, he added, \"and there are also traces of more complex behaviours, like groups of animals gathering in a circle, perhaps for the purposes of defence.\"The prosauropods, which could be up to 10m (33ft) long,  walked on two legs but in some cases handprints were found in front of footprints, indicating that they probably stopped and rested their forelimbs on the ground.Elio Della Ferrera, Arch. PaleoStelvioPhotographer Elio Della Ferrera snapped the first picture of the mountain wall showing the footprintsElio Della Ferrera, the photographer who discovered the site, said he hoped the discovery would \"spark reflection in all of us, highlighting how little we know about the places we live in: our home, our planet\".According to a press release from the Italian culture ministry, the area is remote and not accessible by paths, so drones and remote sensing technology will be employed instead.The Stelvio national park is located in the Fraele valley by Italy's border with Switzerland, near where the Winter Olympics will take place next year. \"It's as if history itself wanted to pay homage to the greatest global sporting event, combining past and present in a symbolic passing of the baton between nature and sport,\" said the Italian Ministry of Culture.",

    "body": "16 hours agoNardine Saad,Los AngelesandRegan MorrisReutersA California doctor who sold ketamine to Friends star Matthew Perry has been sentenced to eight months of home detention and three years of supervised release, making him the second person to be sentenced in the actor's death.Dr Mark Chavez is among five people - including another doctor and a dealer known as the Ketamine Queen - who have pleaded guilty to drug-related charges stemming from sitcom star's 2023 death at his Los Angeles home.The San Diego-based physician admitted to obtaining ketamine from his clinic and a wholesale distributor through a fraudulent prescription and sold it to Dr Salvador Plasencia, who supplied the dissociative anaesthetic to Perry. Plasencia was sentenced earlier this month to 30 months in prison.The multiyear federal investigation into Perry's death examined how the Emmy-winning actor acquired ketamine through an underground drug network in Hollywood. Ketamine, a surgical anaesthetic, is used as a treatment for depression, anxiety and pain. Perry, who had battled drug addiction and depression, had been prescribed the drug as part of his treatment but soon started seeking more than what he was allotted.That ultimately led him to the drug ring that ensnared the two doctors, Perry's live-in assistant, a man named Erik Fleming and American-British dual-national Jasveen Sangha, the dealer known as the Ketamine Queen. The latter three are due to be sentenced in the coming months. A post-mortem examination of Perry found a high concentration of ketamine in his blood and determined that \"acute effects\" of the substance killed him.ReutersMark Chavez, a doctor accused of supplying ketamine to 'Friends' actor Matthew Perry before his death, arrives in federal court in Los Angeles, California, on 2 October 2024.Prosecutors said Perry's assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, worked with Chavez and Plasencia to provide the actor with more than $50,000 (£38,000) of ketamine in the weeks before his death.In his plea agreement, Chavez admitted that he obtained ketamine from both his former clinic and a wholesale distributor through a fraudulent prescription. He submitted a fraudulent prescription for 30 ketamine lozenges under a former patient's name -  without her knowledge or consent - to sell to Plasencia to give to Perry. He confessed to selling 22 vials of liquid ketamine and nine ketamine lozenges to Plasencia, according to his October 2024 plea agreement.The transaction was part of a broader scheme in which Chavez and Plasencia discussed exploiting Perry's addiction for financial gain by mocking him in their text exchanges.\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia wrote to Chavez. Chavez faced up to 10 years in federal prison. As part of his October 2024 plea deal, he surrendered his medical licence and passport.",

    "body": "17 hours agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentThe European Commission has watered down its plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035.Current rules state that new vehicles sold from that date should be \"zero emission\", but carmakers, particularly in Germany, have lobbied heavily for concessions.Under the European Commission's new plan, 90% of new cars sold from 2035 would have to be zero-emission, rather than 100%.According to the European carmakers association, ACEA, market demand for electric cars is currently too low, and without a change to the rules, manufacturers would risk \"multi-billion euro\" penalties.The remaining 10% could be made up of conventional petrol or diesel cars, along with hybrids.Carmakers will be expected to use low-carbon steel made in the EU in the vehicles they produce.The Commission also expects an increase in the use of biofuels and so-called e-fuels, which are synthesised from captured carbon dioxide, to compensate for the extra emissions created by petrol and diesel vehicles. Opponents of the move have warned that it risks undermining the transition towards electric vehicles and leaving the EU exposed in the face of foreign competition.The green transport group T&E has warned that the UK should not follow the EU's lead by weakening its own plans to phase out the sale of conventional cars under the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate.\"The UK must stand firm. Our ZEV mandate is already driving jobs, investment and innovation into the UK. As major exporters we cannot compete unless we innovate, and global markets are going electric fast,\" said T&E UK's director Anna Krajinska.Ahead of the announcement, Sigrid de Vries, director general at ACEA, said that \"flexibility\" for manufacturers was \"urgent\".\"2030 is around the corner, and market demand is too low to avoid the risk of multi-billion-euro penalties for manufacturers,\" she said.\"It will take time to build the charging points and introduce fiscal and purchase incentives to get the market on track. Policy makers must provide breathing space to manufacturers to sustain jobs, innovation and investments.\"Carmakers in the UK have previously called for better incentives to encourage drivers to buy electric ahead of the government's planned ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.Firms across the world have been changing their production lines and investing billions as governments try to persuade people to drive greener cars to meet environmental targets.Volvo said it had \"built a complete EV portfolio in less than 10 years\" and was prepared to go fully electric, using hybrids as a transition. It argued if it can move away from petrol and diesel vehicles, other companies should be able to as well.The carmaker said: \"Weakening long-term commitments for short-term gain risks undermining Europe's competitiveness for years to come. \"A consistent and ambitious policy framework, as well as investments in public infrastructure, is what will deliver real benefits for customers, for the climate, and for Europe's industrial strength.\"However, German carmaker Volkswagen welcomed the European Commission's draft proposal on new CO₂ targets, calling it \"economically sound overall\".It said: \"The fact that small electric vehicles are to receive special support in future is very positive. It is extremely important that the CO₂ targets for 2030 are made more flexible for passenger cars and adjusted for light commercial vehicles.\"Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions.\"Colin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank, said the UK having \"stable policy\" would give companies the confidence to invest in charging infrastructure and avoid \"jeopardising investments\".\"It was government policy that saw Sunderland chosen to build Nissan's original electric Leaf, and today the latest Nissan EV has started rolling off the production lines in the North East, securing jobs for years to come,\" he said.Octopus Electric Vehicles chief executive Fiona Howarth warned that if the UK reduced its goals because of changes in Brussels, it would send a \"damaging signal to investors, manufacturers and supply-chain partners\".Many of these groups have already invested heavily in the transition \"on the assumption the UK would stay the course,\" she said.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has expanded a US travel ban, barring nationals of five additional countries and people travelling on Palestinian Authority-issued documents from entering the US.The White House said the restrictions were intended \"to protect the security of the United States\" and will come into force on 1 January.Full-entry restrictions will be imposed on people from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria as well as Palestinian Authority passport holders.The administration also moved Laos and Sierra Leone, which were previously subject to partial restrictions, to the full ban list and put partial restrictions on 15 other countries, including Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.Trump, who has tightened immigration controls since returning to the White House in January, said the expanded travel ban was necessary because of what his administration described as failures in screening and vetting systems overseas. Officials cited high visa overstay rates, unreliable civil records, corruption, terrorist activity and a lack of cooperation in accepting deported nationals.The announcement followed the arrest of an Afghan national suspected of shooting two National Guard troops over the Thanksgiving weekend, an incident the White House pointed to in highlighting its security concerns.This is the third time Trump has imposed a travel ban. During his first term, he introduced a similar order in 2017, which sparked protests and legal challenges at home and abroad. The policy was later upheld by the US Supreme Court.The White House said the restrictions would remain in place until affected countries show \"credible improvements\" in identity management, information-sharing and cooperation with US immigration authorities.A number of exceptions apply and the ban will not affect lawful permanent residents, many existing visa holders, diplomats, or athletes travelling for major sporting events. Officials said case-by-case waivers would also be available where travel is deemed to be in the national interest.Countries with full restrictions:AfghanistanBurkina FasoBurmaChadEquatorial GuineaEritreaHaitiIranLaosLibyaMaliNigerRepublic of the CongoSierra LeoneSomaliaSouth SudanSudanSyriaYemenIndividuals travelling on Palestinian Authority issued or endorsed travel documents are also subject to a full suspension of entryPartial restrictions:AngolaAntigua and BarbudaBeninBurundiCôte d'IvoireCubaDominicaGabonThe GambiaMalawiMauritaniaNigeriaSenegalTanzaniaTogoTongaVenezuelaZambiaZimbabweSpecial case: Turkmenistan (restrictions remain for immigrants but have been lifted for non-immigrant visas)",

    "body": "24 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondent in KyivYURIY DYACHYSHYN/AFPAcross Ukraine electricity is being rationed – with supplies turned on for a few hours each dayUkraine's biggest private energy provider is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive has told the BBC.Most of Ukraine is suffering from lengthy power cuts as temperatures drop and Maxim Timchenko, whose company DTEK provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, says the intensity of strikes has been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that Russia knew the winter cold could become one of its most dangerous weapons.\"Every night Ukrainian parents hold their children in basements and shelters hoping our air defence will hold,\" he told the Dutch parliament.As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full scale invasion approaches, Maxim Timchenko says Russia has repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and his company has found it difficult to cope.Tens of thousands of people in the southern city of Odesa have been without electricity for three days this week, following a co-ordinated Russian attack.ReutersMuch of Odesa has been without power in recent days\"Life has been difficult, but people are very supportive of each other,\" says Yana, who is among those lucky enough still to have power. She has invited friends to her home to charge their phones.Power outages also cut off heat and water supplies and Yana says those still connected to the grid have offered strangers the chance to wash or take a shower.Across Ukraine electricity is being rationed – with supplies turned on for a few hours each day.Many Ukrainians rely on power banks and generators as a back-up, and the sound of generators in the capital is now more constant than the air raid warnings.Kyiv resident Tetiana says the first thing she does in the morning is to check her phone to find out the daily schedule for when her power will be switched on. Like many she has invested in power banks to make life more bearable:\"You need to remember when you leave home to leave the powerbanks on so that you have them charged when you get back home.\"ShutterstockMany Ukrainians rely on powerbanks and generators during regular power cutsAbout 50% of Ukraine's energy is currently supplied by three large nuclear power plants in central and western Ukraine. But the network that transfers that power has been severely damaged.DTEK runs about 5 power stations, most of them fuelled by coal.One was recently targeted by five 5 ballistic missiles and Mr Timchenko said some of their power plants and sub stations had been attacked \"every three or four days\".\"I don't remember a single day when I had no reports about some damage to our grid.\"Matthew Goddard/BBCDTEK chief executive Maxim Timchenko says his company has found it hard to copeFinding spare parts to repair damaged equipment has become a significant challenge.The energy provider used to be able to source equipment from within Ukraine, but now it has to scour the ret of Europe for replacement parts.This year DTEK has had to spend $166m (£123m) on repairing its damaged thermal power plants and coal facilities.\"We will not give up,\" Maxim Timchenko insists: \"We have a responsibility to millions of mothers to have power and heat\".DTEK's origins are in the Donbas in Eastern Ukraine where the fighting is fiercest and where power supplies have been disrupted the most. Eight of its engineers have been killed doing their job.\"Every day they risk their lives to keep power in this area,\" Mr Timchenko said.Additional reporting by Anastasia Levchenko and Kyla Herrmannsen.",

    "body": "Finland's delegate to last month's Miss Universe pageant held in Thailand has sparked controversy and outrage after a photo of her pulling the corners of her eyes went viral.Sarah Dzafce, who has been stripped of her Miss Finland crown, uploaded the photo with the caption \"eating with a Chinese\". The slanted-eyes pose is often seen as disrespectful to East Asians.The post drew backlash in Japan, South Korea and China against the 22-year-old and even against her country's flag carrier, Finnair.Even Finland's prime minister weighed in on Monday, saying that making such gestures was \"thoughtless and stupid\" and that the controversy that ensued was \"damaging\" to the country.Ms Dzafce claimed the gesture was her reaction to a headache during dinner. She said a friend added the offensive caption to the 11 December post without her consent, according to local tabloid Ilta-Sanomat.Ms Dzafce has apologised for the photo, noting it has \"caused ill will in many people\".\"That was not my intention in any way... One of the most important things for me is respect for people, their backgrounds and differences,\" she wrote on an Instagram post.  The apology still drew criticism, with some calling it \"insincere\" given it was written in Finnish.\"Not sure Chinese outside of Finland would understand it. Such considerate and sincere apology,\" one wrote in a comment on her post.Another wrote: \"That was uncalled for, Asian people didn't do anything to you... We [are] still disappointed in you.\"Two right-wing MPs in Finland, Juho Eerola and Kaisa Garedew, posted photos of themselves mimicking Ms Dzafce's gesture to show their support for the beauty queen.The posts were taken down after backlash. Eerola apologised adding he felt Ms Dzafce was given \"disproportionately harsh punishment\".Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo condemned the MPs' actions as \"childish\", adding that lawmakers should set an example of proper conduct.The Finns Party is deliberating whether the MPs should face any sanctions for their actions, local media reported.Finnair told public broadcaster Yle that the controversy had affected the company, and that there had been calls for tourists to boycott Finland.\"The statements or posts mentioned by some Finnish members of parliament do not represent the values of Finnair,\" the airline wrote on its Japanese X account on Tuesday.\"As an airline supported by employees from diverse backgrounds and customers around the world, we promise to welcome everyone with respect,\" it wrote.The debacle has also drawn attention in Japan, South Korea and China, among other East Asian countries.A Japanese man living in Finland launched a petition calling for an investigation into anti-Asian discrimination, which had gathered more than 7,000 signatures as of Sunday evening, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.The Finnish embassy in Japan said it had received \"numerous opinions and questions\" on Finland's efforts to address racism. \"Racism remains a challenge in Finnish society, and its resolution requires continuous and resolute efforts,\" it acknowledged in an X post earlier this week.The controversy around Ms Dzafce is a postscript to a chaotic Miss Universe pageant hosted in Thailand that had been beset by walkouts and allegations of rigging.The Miss Finland Organisation said dethroning Ms Dzafce was a \"difficult but necessary\" move.\"Miss Finland holds a position of role-model status, which requires respecting all people regardless of their origin, background, or appearance,\" the organisation said in a statement.\"We are deeply sorry for the harm these events have caused. Especially to the Asian community, but also to everyone affected. Racism is never acceptable in any form,\" it wrote.",

    "body": "Naveed Akram, the surviving suspect in Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act, the New South Wales police say.His father Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in an exchange of fire with police at the scene.Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in the attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. It was the country's deadliest shooting since 1996.Akram also faces 40 charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, as well as one charge of causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.He was critically injured during the incident on Sunday, and had his first hearing from his hospital bedside, the local New South Wales court said. The case has been adjourned until April 2026, the court added. Earlier on Wednesday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said they were waiting for medication to wear off before formally questioning Akram.\"For his fairness, we need him to understand what is exactly happening,\" Lanyon said.As of Wednesday evening local time, 17 people are still being treated in hospitals across Sydney. One is in critical condition, with four others described as critical but stable.Police have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been \"motivated by Islamic State\" group ideology.On Tuesday, it emerged that the father and son had travelled to the Philippines in November.The Philippine immigration bureau told the BBC that they were in the country from 1 November to 28 November. Their final destination was the southern city of Davao, an immigration spokesperson said.Naveed Akram travelled to the Philippines using an Australian passport, while his father Sajid used an Indian passport, border authorities in Manila told the BBC.Sajid Akram was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, but had \"limited contact\" with his family there, a police official from the Indian state of Telangana said.Among those killed in the attack were two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl, named by her family as Matilda.Boris and Sofia Gurman, a couple filmed wrestling with one of the gunmen during the early stages of the attack, were also among the victims.Another 27 people were taken to hospital with injuries, including two police officers. One of the officers, named as 22-year-old Jack Hibbert, has lost vision in one eye and faces a \"long and challenging recovery\", his family said in a statement.Earlier in the day, thousands gathered to mourn British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, at the first funeral to be held for victims of the shooting.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was not present. Asked on ABC NewsRadio about his absence, he said: \"I would attend anything that I'm invited to. These are funerals that are taking place to farewell people's loved ones.\"The Jewish community has criticised Albanese for not taking enough action on antisemitism - he defended himself against those accusations, telling ABC NewsRadio he had taken a series of measures including appointing the country's first antisemitism envoy, toughening hate speech laws and increasing funding for social cohesion projects and Jewish institutions.Speaking at Rabbi Schlanger's funeral, Rabbi Levi Wolff described his death as an \"unspeakable loss\" for the community.\"Eli was ripped away from us, doing what he loved best,\" he said.\"Spreading love and joy and caring for his people with endless self-sacrifice in his life and in his death, he towered above as one of the highest and holiest souls.\"Rabbi Schlanger had helped organise Sunday's Hanukkah event.Funerals for the other victims are expected to happen over the coming days, including for the youngest victim, Matilda, on Thursday.",

    "body": "A popular South African radio and club DJ has been shot dead in the country's largest city, Johannesburg, sending shockwaves across the nation grappling with entrenched crime. Warrick Stock, popularly known as DJ Warras, was gunned down in the city centre on Tuesday afternoon. Police said the 40-year-old media personality was approached by three suspects, one of whom opened fire on him before fleeing on foot. The motive of the shooting is unknown and no arrests have been made, police said.Stock was a well-known radio and TV presenter and a podcaster in South Africa. Fred Kekana, a local police chief, said Stock was attacked outside Zambesi House near Carlton Centre. Stock spent several hours at the building overseeing the installation of security systems at the premises, which had been controversially occupied by unknown people, reports the state-run SABC.\"It is alleged the victim was approached by three unknown suspects after parking his vehicle, and they opened fire at him before fleeing the scene on foot,\" the South African Police Service (SAPS) said in a statement. CCTV footage showed a man with dreadlocks and dressed in what looked like a security uniform opening fire on Stock before fleeing, said Kekana.  The DJ tried to run away after he was shot but fell down across the street, the police chief added. He said that Stock had an unused firearm on him and nothing was taken during the attack.Key evidence, like cartridges, were discovered at the scene, according to the police. Police have appealed to eyewitnesses and members of the public who may have seen the suspects to come forward. \"We know they walked a long distance after the shooting, and officers have been tracking them to determine their whereabouts,\" added Kekana. His sister Nicole Stock told SABC that the family was struggling to process his death.\"I am in shock. I don't have words. I am shattered,\" she said.\"We know he was a voice for many people around the country. He spoke out bravely about issues not many people were willing to speak about. This is a tremendous loss.\"She appealed to the public to refrain from sharing graphic images or videos from the scene, saying this was an incredibly difficult time, especially for Shock's three sons. Stock was the presenter of Ngicel' iVisa, a reality show that premiered on Mzansi Magic, a South African digital satellite entertainment channel.Beyond his media career, Stock was involved in various business ventures, including private security, providing elite guarding and VIP protection services and securing high-profile events across South Africa, according to local media. He was also reportedly involved in property management and assisted with building evictions.His murder has shocked the country and prompted an outpouring of tributes from his fans, the government and political parties.Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie said he was angry and saddened by Stock's murder. \"He spoke his truth without fear or favour. He even spoke up against me and my decisions as a minister. He was a pure example of who we should be,\" added McKenzie. Leader of South African's Build One party Mmusi Maimane said the \"brazen murder of DJ Warras in broad daylight is a shock for all South Africans\". \"DJ Warras was more than just a face of a reality series. He was a talented storyteller, a passionate music lover and a warm soul who brought joy and energy to every moment on screen. His dedication to creativity left an indelible mark on our channels,\" said Shirley Adonisi, director of local entertainment Channels (Mnet). In a statement, Mzansi Magic said Stock was known for his charisma, warmth and sharp wit, adding that his legacy \"will live on\". South Africa, the continent's most industrialised nation, has one of the world's highest murder rates, fuelled by robberies and gang violence, with some 63 people killed each day between April and September, according to police data.",

    "body": "23 hours agoStewart MacleanReutersMany of those displaced by the violence in el-Fasher have ended up living in campsSudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been trying to cover up mass killings in the city of el-Fasher by burying and burning bodies, a research team from Yale University says.The RSF had drawn international condemnation amid reports of executions and crimes against humanity when its fighters captured the city in October.Now, analysis of satellite images by Yale's Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) shows the RSF likely disposed of tens of thousands of bodies after seizing el-Fasher.The RSF has not responded to the report, but its leader previously admitted his fighters had committed some violations in the city.The HRL's report said the RSF \"engaged in a systematic multi-week campaign to destroy evidence of its widespread mass killings\" and \"this pattern of body disposal and destruction is ongoing\".The paramilitary group has been fighting Sudan's regular army since April 2023, when a power struggle between the two parties erupted into a brutal civil war.The United Nations (UN) has described the conflict as the world's worst humanitarian disaster.After 18 months of besieging el-Fasher, the RSF captured the city - a major victory pushing the army out of its last foothold in the vast Darfur region.The UN was among the many global voices accusing the RSF of massacring civilians as el-Fasher fell.The HRL has been monitoring the situation in the city for months, and its latest report is part of efforts to understand the extent of the violence suffered by the city's residents.Fresh analysis of satellite imagery found clusters in multiple locations changing in size in the weeks after el-Fasher fell, the HRL says, adding that this demonstrates continued efforts by the RSF to clean up evidence of massacres.The images also show more than 80 clusters located outside of the city, which, the HRL says, shows that the RSF was killing people as they tried to flee.ReutersEl-Fasher was repeatedly shelled during the RSF siege - this picture from 7 October shows a wrecked classroom where people were sheltering Satellite evidence from November suggests limited civilian activity in the city since it was seized, the researchers say.Following an international backlash, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo declared an investigation into what he called violations committed by his soldiers during the capture of el-Fasher.However, the group continued to deny widespread allegations that killings in the city are ethnically motivated and follow a pattern of the Arab paramilitaries targeting non-Arab populations.The latest HRL report follows warnings from aid agencies about the low number of civilians who managed to succesfully flee el-Fasher after the RSF seizure.The UN estimates roughly 250,000 people were still trapped in the city, with less than half of that number thought to have arrived in external camps for displaced people.The RSF has used the seizure of el-Fasher to consolidate its power in western Sudan, and has established a parallel government in Darfur's city of Nyala.Sudan's army still controls most of the country, with fighting between the two groups rumbling on.More than 13m people are believed to have been displaced since the war began in April 2023.More BBC stories about Sudan:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

He added that it would \"only get bigger\" and \"be like nothing they have ever seen before\".Trump also accused Maduro's government of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\". The president has repeatedly accused Venezuela of drug smuggling, and since September the US military has killed at least 90 people with its strikes on boats that were allegedly carrying fentanyl and other illegal drugs to the US. However, it has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, be it fentanyl - which is mainly produced in Mexico - or cocaine. Tuesday's post from Trump suggested that a label that the US had previously applied only to Maduro was now being widened to his whole government.Last month, the US formally alleged that the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles group was an FTO. The designation meant that Maduro was effectively designated as terrorist as well, because he was alleged to be group's leader - which he denies.Trump's post did not give further detail of how the wide-ranging blockade on sanctioned oil tankers would be enforced.After seizing the tanker last week, the US went on to impose fresh sanctions on six more ships said to be carrying Venezuelan oil.Sanctions were also placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US called his illegitimate regime.Venezuela's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, even though the amount of oil it actually produces is relatively small given that the country is home to the world's largest proven reserves.When announcing the tanker seizure off Venezuela's coast last week, the White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port. Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.The US had been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the weeks and months before the raid.The build-up has involved thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing Texas, said Trump's \"naval blockade is unquestionably an act of war\".He added that US lawmakers would on Thursday vote on a resolution \"directing the president to end hostilities with Venezuela\". The US, under both Trump and former President Joe Biden, has opposed the Maduro government for years and pressed for him to be removed by imposing stringent sanctions.Maduro's government has been accused of rights abuses by the wider international community for many years. Venezuela's opposition, as well as many nations including the US, denounced last year's election as rigged and say his rule is therefore illegitimate.On Tuesday, the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, warned that the country's \"crackdown on civic space has intensified, suffocating people's freedoms\".",

    "body": "Trump's chief of staff disputes Vanity Fair story in which she criticises Vance and Musk11 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWhite House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has disputed portions of a Vanity Fair article in which she paints an unflattering picture of the Trump administration and many of its top officials.In the interview, Wiles described Donald Trump as having an \"alcoholic's personality\" and Vice President JD Vance as having been a \"conspiracy theorist\" for a decade. But in a post on X, Wiles said that Vanity Fair disregarded \"significant context\" to create \"an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative\" about the administration.Wiles, 68, played a key part in Trump's successful 2024 presidential campaign before becoming the first woman to be White House Chief of Staff. In a New York Post interview, Trump defended Wiles, describing her as \"fantastic\" and suggested she had been \"deceived\" by the writer.The president also said he thought Wiles' comments about his personality mirrored remarks he previously made.Over the course of nearly a dozen interviews with Vanity Fair, Wiles talked about a wide range of issues, including  handling of Epstein files, Trump's legal actions against political rivals, and also about personalities around the president.She admitted that \"there may be an element of\" retribution in Trump's efforts to pursue criminal cases against political adversaries or perceived foes. \"I don't think he wakes up thinking about retribution,\" she added. \"But when there's an opportunity, he will go for it.\" Wiles is widely considered among the most powerful members of the Trump White House in his second term. Prior to becoming chief of staff, Wiles had a long history working with Trump, including as his campaign manager in Florida in 2016 and as the head of his fundraising apparatus, Save America. In the interview, she credits her upbringing with an alcoholic father as what enabled her to work with the president.\"High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,\" she said. \"So I'm a little bit of an expert in big personalities.\"While the president does not drink, she said Trump has \"an alcoholic's personality\" and governs with the mindset that \"there's nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing\". Vance on report that Susie Wiles called him a 'conspiracy theorist'. Wiles disputes portions of the article.Among the other figures that Wiles commented on was JD Vance, a one-time critic of Trump who has since become a close ally and vice-president. Wiles suggested that Vance's shift in perceptions was \"sort of political\". Speaking to reporters at an event on Tuesday, Vance said he had not read the article, but that he only believes in conspiracy theories that are \"true\" - citing reports of former President Joe Biden's ill-health as an example. Her strongest comments were reserved for tech billionaire Elon Musk, who led cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency - or Doge - before leaving the government in May.Shortly thereafter, Musk and Trump had a public spat that saw the two men trade barbs and insults over social media.Wiles described Musk as an \"avowed Ketamine [user]\" who \"sleeps in a sleeping bag in the EOB\", the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. \"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are,\" she said. \"You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\" Looking back on Musk's cost-cutting efforts, Wiles said that she was against the gutting of the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, saying she was \"initially aghast\" at the idea. \"I think that anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work,\" she recalled. \"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"With that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"On Tuesday morning - hours after the Vanity Fair article was published - Wiles took to X, accusing the magazine of a \"disingenuously framed hit piece\" aimed at her, Trump and other cabinet members. \"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team,\" she wrote. When contacted for comment on the story, the White House also defended Wiles. In a statement sent to the BBC, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Wiles \"has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history.\" \"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie,\" Leavitt added. \"The entire administration is grateful to her steady leadership and united fully behind her.\" Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing later in the day, Leavitt accused Vanity Fair of \"bias of omission\" by excluding other interviews conducted with White House staff and taking Wiles' words \"wildly out of context\". Musk has yet to comment on the Vanity Fair piece. ",

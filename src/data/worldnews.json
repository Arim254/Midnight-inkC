    "body": "3 hours agoAlys DaviesAFPChiara Ferragni told reporters she was very happy her \"nightmare\" was overAn Italian fashion influencer has been acquitted of aggravated fraud, bringing a long-running scandal involving a charity Christmas cake to an end.Chiara Ferragni had been accused of misleading consumers by promoting the sale of a designer pink pandoro as well as Easter eggs that were said to be helping to raise money for a children's hospital and a charity.After a fast-track trial in Milan, a judge found her and two other defendants not guilty. Had she been convicted, she could have faced a jail term.Ferragni, 38, told reporters the judgment marked \"the end of a nightmare that lasted two years\".The scandal - dubbed \"pandorogate\" - started with the sale of pink special edition Christmas cakes in 2022.Consumers were led to believe that sales of the pandoro would go towards raising funds for a children's hospital in Turin. But it turned out that the cake's producer, Balocco, had given a one-off €50,000 (£43,300) donation to the hospital before the cake's launch.Ferragni has 28 million followers on Instagram and, after her companies made €1m from the promotion, she pledged to donate the same sum to the hospital.The outcry led authorities to initiate a formal investigation and the influencer was handed a €1m fine in 2023 by Italy's competition authority over the pandoro cakes, branded with her name and mentioning the children's hospital.Ferragni-branded Easter eggs also became part of the scandal, leading the influencer to agree to pay €1.2m to a children's charity to settle complaints that the eggs' sales allegedly misled consumers.She was later indicted on the aggravated fraud charges, along with business associate Fabio Damato. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of one year and eight months in prison for Ferragni but the judge rejected their accusation that the fraud should be seen as aggravated.The Milan court found that no aggravation had been involved as a consumer group had withdrawn its original complaint. Ferragni had agreed with consumer organisation Codacons that she would compensate consumers and donate money to a charity for women who had suffered gender violence.\"We are all moved,\" Ferragni told reporters at the end of the trial. \"The last two years have been very hard. I had faith in justice, and justice has been done.\"Despite her acquittal the scandal has proved damaging to Ferragni's brand and affected her personal life. Her marriage to Italian rapper Fedez fell apart last year.It has also led to tighter rules for Italian influencers to show greater transparency in their fund-raising initiatives.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaulin KolaEPAThe community in Crans-Montana remains in shock two weeks after the fireThe Swiss canton of Valais has banned pyrotechnic devices in all indoor public venues following the devastating fire at a bar on New Year's Eve where 40 people were killed and 116 were injured.Authorities said each of the victims would get a 10,000 franc ($12,500; £9,200) emergency payment, with a fund being set up to collect donations.The canton of Geneva also announced a ban on pyrotechnics in indoor venues - days after Vaud became the first of Switzerland's 26 regions to take such a decision.The blaze at Le Constellation bar in the ski resort of Crans-Montana is believed to have started when sparklers attached to champagne bottles set light to sound-insulating foam padding on the ceiling.EPA/ShutterstockJacques and Jessica Moretti, French owners of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, say they are co-operating with the investigationAuthorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.The two co-owners of Le Constallation, French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. His wife has had to surrender her passport and report to police every day.The news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims, most of whom were young - eight were under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns. Eighty remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other European countries.One of the lawyers representing families of the victims said on Tuesday that an online platform had been launched to receive testimonies related to the disaster.\"This initiative aims to facilitate the investigation for the benefit of the victims,\" Romain Jordan said - not to replace the official investigation.Among those who have died was the waitress who was seen in a video wearing a helmet and holding a champagne bottle with a sparkler attached and the ceiling catching fire.Identified widely as Cyane Panine, 24, and from Sète in south-east France, she is said to have been close to the managers of the bar. Her family have issued a statement saying: \"Whatever the outcome of the investigation, this young woman followed her employers' instructions. She did what the general manager asked her to do. Nothing unusual. This young employee is in no way responsible.\" ",

    "body": "3 hours agoTinshui YeungTSGT Scott Reed, USAFAl-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle EastThe US and UK are reducing the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to take action against Iran over its crackdown on anti-government protests. Officials have told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\". The BBC understands some UK military personnel are also being removed. A Qatari government statement said the measures reportedly being taken by the US were \"in response to the current regional tensions\".Trump earlier said the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if the authorities execute protesters. Iran has said it will retaliate if attacked by the US.According to rights groups, more than 2,400 anti-government demonstrators have been killed in the recent violent crackdown by the Iranian authorities.Regarding the removal of military personnel, the Qatari government said it would continue to \"implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents as a top priority, including actions related to the protection of critical infrastructure and military facilities\".Al-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East and about 10,000 personnel are based there, as well as about 100 UK staff. It is not clear how many will be leaving.A UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson declined to comment on reports that UK personnel were being withdrawn \"due to operational security\".Citing diplomats, the Reuters news agency reported that while some personnel had been told to leave the base, there was no immediate sign of large numbers of troops being bussed out like in the hours before an Iranian strike last year.A senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Donald Trump on Wednesday that the June attack had demonstrated Iran's ability to respond to any attack.\"It would certainly help create a real understanding of Iran's will and capability to respond to any attack,\" Ali Shamkhani wrote in a post on X.The US Mission to Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has advised its personnel and citizens to \"exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region\".The US has been threatening to intervene in Iran over the killing of protesters. On Tuesday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Iranian authorities would \"pay a big price\" for the killings, and urged people to \"keep protesting\".He has also said that Iranian leaders had called him and that \"they want to negotiate\" but that the US \"may have to act before a meeting\".Iran's government has accused the US of seeking to \"manufacture a pretext for military intervention\", with the parliament speaker warning that if the US attacked, both Israeli and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets.The latest protests in Iran began at the end of December following the collapse of the currency and as the country deals with soaring living costs. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, the group also reported.",

    "body": "Agents with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raided the home of a Washington Post reporter this week as part of an investigation into a government contractor accused of leaking classified information, officials said. In a post on X, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said agents had searched the home of a journalist who allegedly \"was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor\". Bondi said the contractor had been arrested. The Washington Post identified the reporter to the BBC as Hannah Natanson, who has covered how President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced and reshaped the federal workforce. Natanson was at her home in Virginia on Wednesday when federal agents came to search her home, according to the Washington Post. They took her phone, a work and personal computer and a Garmin watch, the outlet said. Natanson was told she was not the focus of the probe, according to the Washington Post, which reported that officials were investigating Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland with top-secret security clearance. According to an FBI affidavit, Perez-Lugones -  a systems engineer and information technology specialist on contract for the government since 2002 - accessed and printed classified intelligence reports. Officials said they found classified information in a lunch box while searching Perez-Lugones' car, according to court filings. The filing does not mention Perez-Lugones disseminating the information. The court filings say Perez-Lugones has been charged with unlawful retention of national defence information. He is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday. Bondi said the Trump administration would \"not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation's national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country\".The search of Natanson's home sparked concerns from press freedom and free speech advocates. \"Any search targeting a journalist warrants intense scrutiny because these kinds of searches can deter and impede reporting that is vital to our democracy,\" Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, said in a statement. Natanson previously wrote about her experience gathering more than 1,000 sources who currently and formerly worked for the federal government, as she reported on the layoffs, buyouts and firings that Trump has used since returning to office to shrink the federal workforce and change the focus of many agencies.Natanson wrote about sources inside government agencies sharing information they \"weren't supposed to tell me\" and the intensity of receiving sensitive information from so many people. In April, Bondi ended Biden-era policies that had protected journalists from having their phone records seized or being forced to testify in leak probes. ",

    "body": "The Trump administration is placing an indefinite pause on immigrant visa processing from 75 countries, further restricting the legal routes for entering the US.The State Department on Wednesday said the administration wants to bring \"an end to the abuse\" of the system \"by those who would extract wealth from the American people\" by using welfare and public benefits.President Donald Trump has sought to limit both illegal and legal crossing into the US since returning to office, and his administration has already halted immigrant visa processing for people from Brazil, Iran, Russia and Somalia.The order takes effect on 21 January, but a full list of the 75 countries has not yet been released.\"The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people,\" said Tommy Pigott, Principal Deputy spokesperson for the US State Department.The department, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will pause the visa processing while it reassesses its procedures \"to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits\", Piggott added.According to the Associated Press, the State Department has instructed consular officers to halt immigrant visa applications from the affected countries. But the suspension will not apply to non-immigrant, temporary tourist, or business visas.In recent months, the State Department has increased restrictions on migration from countries Trump has deemed a threat to national security, including Russia, Iran and Afghanistan and several countries in Africa.After an immigrant from Afghanistan was charged in the November in the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, the administration banned or limited the entry of nationals of 19 countries. In December, it expanded the travel ban to people from five additional countries and those travelling on Palestinian Authority-issued documents.Asylum cases, citizenship processing and green card applications for immigrants from the initial 19 countries in the ban have also been paused.",

    "body": "'Appropriate and unambiguous': White House defends Trump over middle-finger gesture at hecklerThe White House has defended US President Donald Trump after he aimed an offensive gesture at a heckler during his appearance at a Ford factory in Detroit on Tuesday.Footage of the incident published by TMZ appears to show the president responding to a man who shouted at him from afar.The White House said: \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"The heckler has been suspended by Ford, the United Auto Workers union told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.A Ford spokesperson told CBS: \"One of our core values is respect and we don't condone anyone saying anything inappropriate like that within our facilities. \"When that happens, we have a process to deal with it but we don't get into specific personnel matters.\"According to the subtitles provided by TMZ, the heckler called Trump a \"paedophile protector\". In the clip, which shows Trump from a distance, the president can be seen speaking back at the heckler, allegedly mouthing an expletive as well as using a middle-finger gesture.  A man who spoke to The Washington Post, named TJ Sabula, reportedly identified himself as the man who shouted, saying he had \"no regrets\". He allegedly said he meant his remarks in reference to Trump's handling of the Epstein files. Trump has faced pressure for more transparency on what was uncovered by federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender.Trump signed a law that compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release all the files that it held on Epstein by 19 December, although only a fraction of the files have so far been made public.Trump was once friends with Epstein before they fell out, which Trump says was years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Trump was in Detroit on Tuesday to give a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. The president's public use of expletives have attracted headlines in the past - for example, when discussing the relationship between Iran and Israel last June.His predecessor Joe Biden also caused controversy for uttering an expletive during a conversation with a worker during his own visit to a factory in Detroit while on the campaign trail in 2020, before he was elected president.

The director of an organisation that helps Iranians get online also told BBC Persian that Starlink had been made free.The satellite technology, which belongs to Elon Musk's SpaceX company, provides internet to tens of thousands of people in Iran, despite the fact it is illegal there. Since the internet was shut down, it has become one of the last, if not the last, remaining channels for Iranians to communicate with the outside world.The BBC has approached SpaceX to confirm it has waived the fee, but they are yet to respond.Using the service in Iran carries a punishment of up to two years in prison and authorities have reportedly been searching for Starlink dishes to stop people from connecting to the internet.\"They're going onto rooftops and checking the surrounding buildings,\" says Parsa - not his real name - who spoke to BBC Persian using a Starlink connection. \"What people need to know is that the government is searching areas where a lot of footage has come out, so they need to be even more cautious,\" he says.The device operates like a mobile phone mast in space, using a constellation of satellites to communicate with small dishes on the ground with a built-in WiFi router.But the device is costly and beyond the means of many in Iran - so making it free may lead to its wider use.Why are there protests in Iran and what has Trump said about US action?Bowen: Authoritarian regimes die gradually then suddenly, but Iran is not there yetSpeaking to Al Jazeera TV on Monday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet had been cut off \"after we confronted terrorist operations and realised orders were coming from outside the country\".Iran's Fars news agency, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), claimed internet restrictions were imposed to stop foreign social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram being used \"to organise violence and unrest.\"Human rights groups have condemned the blanket blackout as an abuse of power and a spokesperson for the UN's Human rights office told the BBC the shutdown \"impacts the works of those documenting human rights violations.\"So far, one human rights group has confirmed the killing of more than 2,400 protesters during the unrest, as well as almost 150 people affiliated with security forces, although these numbers are believed to be much higher.It is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country.Getty ImagesStarlink terminals, like the one pictured here, can allow users to connect directly to the internet via satellites, bypassing the blackoutThe internet shutdown has also made it hard to gather and verify evidence of what is happening on the ground.\"I think a lot of people are connected, but only a very small number are taking the risk of sending information out,\" explains Parsa.According to human rights organisation Witness, at least 50,000 people are using Starlink to access the internet.Mahsa Alimardani, who works as its associate director for technology, threats and opportunities, says the Iranian authorities have tried \"aggressively jamming\" Starlink to stop people accessing the internet but it has not been successful. \"That's why they are resorting to physical confiscations,\" she adds.But those who are taking the risk are going to great lengths. One man who spoke to BBC Persian said he travelled almost 1,000km (620 miles) to a border area so he could use mobile networks of neighbouring countries to send video he recorded.The scene he witnessed - of a huge number of bodies lying on the ground at a forensic medical centre in Tehran - was so distressing that he felt compelled to share it, he told the BBC.The Iranian government has a long track record of spying on its citizens, including digitally, to tighten its grip on society.Phishing techniques have reportedly been used to hack phones and access people's data and Iran's access to the internet is largely restricted to a domestic service that mimics a private intranet. Access to Western social media platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram is blocked, meaning Iranians have to use virtual private networks (VPNs) in order to access them.But despite this, Instagram is one of the most popular platforms in Iran, with an estimated 50 million users.BBC NewsThough some news is being shared online, experts say the Iranian government aims to control the narrative by limiting what information gets out.Ana Diamond, research associate at the Oxford Disinformation and Extremism Lab, says the government is weaponising information by carefully curating it.\"Such material is designed less to inform than to condition; to almost normalise casualties, especially as the Iranian government calls them rioters, eroding collective resistance, and preparing the public - both inside and outside of Iran - for escalations of violence that may be yet to come if the protests continue,\" Diamond says.Despite the dangers, Starlink has become indispensable for many Iranians communicating what is happening inside the country to the rest of the world.\"I'd rather not think about it [getting caught]. It can be very frightening,\" Parsa says.On Tuesday, Iranian intelligence forces said they had seized a large consignment of Starlink kits allegedly intended for \"espionage and sabotage operations\" inside the country.However, BBC Persian has confirmed through multiple sources in Iran that the kits are used by many people wanting to communicate without censorship.Parsa cautions that getting caught using the device is not the only danger.If Iranians want to send videos that are shared or intercepted online, he says, \"they need to understand that if they record them from home or from the place where the device is kept, their risk increases, and the government can identify the location\".Additional reporting by Hadi Nili, BBC Tech correspondent",

    "body": "US envoy Steve Witkoff has announced the start of phase two of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, with a technocratic Palestinian government established in the territory.He said the second phase would also see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.\"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations,\" he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Following the US announcement, regional mediators Egypt, Gaza and Turkey welcomed the formation of what they called the \"Palestinian Technocratic Committee to Administer the Gaza Strip\", saying it would \"contribute to strengthening efforts aimed at consolidating stability and improving the humanitarian situation\".They also revealed that the 15-member body would be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy planning minister in the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.The transitional administration will operate under the supervision of a \"Board of Peace\", which will be chaired by Trump, according to the 20-point plan he unveiled three months ago.Announcements related to the board are expected in the coming days, including when the president visits the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.Former UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov, who has been meeting Israeli and Palestinian officials, is set to be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza.Earlier on Wednesday, Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said in a joint statement that they had agreed to support the efforts to form the technocratic Palestinian government \"while providing the appropriate environment\" for it to begin work.The PA - which is dominated by Fatah, Hamas's rival - also expressed its support. Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh said Trump's leadership had \"contributed to creating a new opportunity for peace, stability, and good governance\", and urged all Palestinian factions, institutions and segments of society to \"ensure the success of this critical transitional phase\".The office of Israel's prime minister meanwhile said he had spoken on Wednesday evening with the parents of Ran Gvili, the last dead hostage in Gaza.Benjamin Netanyahu made it clear to Itzik and Talik Gvili \"that Ran's return is our top priority and that the declarative move to establish a technocratic committee will not affect efforts to return Ran for burial in Israel\", his office added.The 24-year-old police officer was among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,430 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "You must have heard of Dubai chocolate: the sticky, indulgent confectionary filled with pistachio cream, tahini and shreds of knafeh pastry, which has become a global sensation.Now the decadent bar has inspired South Korea's latest dessert craze. The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. \"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. \"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily.

    "body": "5 hours agoRegan Morris,Los Angeles, CaliforniaandChristal Hayes,Los Angeles, CaliforniaSport fans can now sign up for a chance to attend the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games - with tickets starting at $28 (£21).Registration has opened for fans to enter a random ticket draw covering all events that will take place at the Games. The window will remain open until mid-March. If chosen, fans will be notified via email and will be given a time slot to purchase tickets in April. One million of those tickets will sell for $28, and about one-third are set to cost less than $100 (£74.41).\"These Games belong to everyone,\" Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2028 said on Tuesday. \"These Games have to be affordable and inclusive.\"The announcement of affordable ticket prices come after the price of tickets for the 2026 men's football World Cup - which will also be hosted in the US, as well as Canada and Mexico - received some public criticism. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, LA officials said affordability and accessibility were central to their ticketing plan - and their hope that sport fans around the globe would be able to attend. Tickets for the 2024 Olympics in Paris started at $27.95 (£21).A special early purchase window will also be open for residents in the Los Angeles area and Oklahoma City, where some Olympic Games are also being held.2028 will be the first time the Olympics will be held in the US since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Los Angeles has twice hosted the Olympics - in 1932 and 1984 - and plans to use its already established infrastructure to host the Games. Event organisers, along with hundreds of Olympians and Paralympians, gathered at the LA Memorial Coliseum on Tuesday for a ceremonial lighting of the Olympic venue's cauldron ahead of the opening of ticket registration. The Coliseum hosted events on both the previous occasions that the Olympics were held in LA, and it is set to co-host the opening ceremony along with track and field events in 2028. Organisers at the event on Tuesday explained how the ticketing would work. Once registered - using their name, email and zip code - fans will be entered into the random draw for time slots to buy tickets in April. The earlier slot a fan is given, the better their chances at securing tickets - as being given a time slot does not guarantee that there will be tickets available once a time slot is open.The first set of tickets will be up for purchase from 9-19 April. Admission for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games will be among the tickets on offer.Most of the Games will be held across Los Angeles and southern California, but both canoeing and softball will be held in Oklahoma. LA28 chief Allison Katz-Mayfield called the random ticket-drawing process \"the fairest way to ensure that the broadest number of people can get access to tickets and that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged\". \"No matter when you go in, whether you're the first person in or the last person in, you have the same opportunity,\" she added.Registration for tickets will be open until 18 March, and there is no advantage to registering early.",

    "body": "13 hours agoKoh EweandJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentA surreal drum duet between two East Asian world leaders has set the internet abuzz - and put a spotlight on Japan and South Korea's diplomatic relationship.Decked out in matching blue jackets, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday played drums to the beats of K-pop hits - including Dynamite by BTS and Golden from hit film KPop Demon Hunters.The performance, a nod to Takaichi's past life as a drummer in a heavy metal band, wrapped up Lee's official visit to Japan this week.It's also part of Lee's diplomatic overtures to regional powers including Japan, with whom South Korea has a fraught history but shares a security alliance.The drumming session from Tuesday, which Lee described as \"a little clumsy\", has now spawned a viral video.During Lee's visit to Nara, Takaichi's hometown, he gifted the Japanese prime minister a drum set. The two leaders also exchanged signed drumsticks after their performance.\"When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise,\" Takaichi later wrote on X.Footage of the jam session has won praise on social media.\"Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could,\" one X user wrote in Korean. \"Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward.\"There have long been sore spots between the two neighbours, including historical grievances from Japan's colonial rule and territorial disputes.But both countries are allies of the US, and have worked together to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region.On Tuesday, Takaichi said in a statement that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the US has become increasingly important amid heightened tensions in the region's \"strategic environment\".Lee and Takaichi have also agreed to boost economic cooperation - a pledge that comes as China has been tightening its export of rare earths and dual-use goods to Japan.\"Just seeing them actually playing drums together - not just posing - looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most,\" an X user wrote in Japanese. \"Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction.\"Lee's smoothness as a diplomat has boosted his approval ratings back home.Days before his viral jam session with Takaichi, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, with whom he took selfies on a Chinese smartphone.Last October, he flattered US President Donald Trump with a large golden crown. The only leader he hasn't been able to charm is North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has rejected Lee's overtures for peace and shown little interest in reconciliation. This week, Pyongyang demanded an apology from Seoul after accusing it of flying surveillance drones in its territory.Lee's rise to become president of South Korea had previously sounded alarm bells in Tokyo and Washington. Relatively unknown outside his own country at the time, Lee had a reputation as a firebrand who was sympathetic to socialist economic causes. The US feared South Korea would tilt towards China, South Korea's largest trading partner.Japan, meanwhile, feared a repeat of a spat in 2019, when South Korea threatened to pull out of an intelligence-sharing agreement after Japan tightened its exports to the country.That fight broke out after a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate the survivors of Japan's wartime forced labour, an issue Japan now considers resolved.Since taking office, however, Lee has walked a diplomatic tightrope among the region's major powers, from the US to China and now Japan.Lee heaped praise on Takaichi's drumming skills in a post on X, and likened their diplomatic efforts to the musical duet.\"Even if our timing was slightly different, our intention to find the same rhythm was shared,\" he wrote. \"In that same spirit, we will continue to build a future-oriented Korea–Japan relationship together, with one heart.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoSammy AwamiBBC Africa, KampalaThe head of Uganda's electoral body says he has received threats warning him against declaring certain presidential candidates the winners of Thursday's election.Simon Byabakama said he would not be intimidated by such threats from senior state officials, whom he did not name.He was responding to a BBC question about a widely shared video which shows a presidential assistant saying the electoral commission would never declare opposition candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, as president, even if he were to win.\"Some people say if you don't declare so-and-so as president, you will see. I tell them that I am not in the business of donating votes,\" said Byabakama. President Yoweri Museveni, 81, who has ruled the country for nearly four decades, is seeking a seventh term in office.Bobi Wine, a 43-year-old pop star turned politician, is Museveni's main challenger, seeking to unseat him for the second time after finishing runner-up in 2021 polls.Six other candidates are also in the race, in which about 21.6 million voters are registered to vote.Campaigning has been marked by the disruption of opposition activities, including the detention of activists and the breaking-up of rallies by police.At the Electoral Commission headquarters in the capital, Kampala, Byabakama said he was not worried about threats from what he called \"idle people\".  \"You can see from my demeanour that fear is a word that does not exist in my vocabulary,\" said  the poll chief, adding that only the will of voters and the law would guide the process.In the video shared by the Daily Monitor newspaper on social media last week, Yiga Kisakyamukama, the special presidential assistant for service delivery and monitoring, was captured saying Museveni would never leave power through the ballot. \"Don't expect, don't even think, that Simon Byabakama would announce Bobi Wine. President Museveni, who is on the chair, will remain on the chair. Never think that Museveni would leave power through voting. No, no, no - don't waste our time,\" Kisakyamukama was heard saying. But Byabakama said Uganda's law, not individual opinions or threats, would determine the outcome of the presidential election.\"The law says that the candidate who receives more than 50% plus one of the total valid votes cast is the president of Uganda. It is the voters who determine how many votes a candidate gets. What the voters have said is what I will declare to the nation,\" he added. The poll chief said he would declare the results within 48 hours of the close of polling, in accordance with the country's laws. Responding to concerns about the heavy military presence in the streets, Byabakama said security forces were deployed to maintain peace and stability during the electoral process and should not intimidate voters. He also acknowledged opposition concerns about some polling stations being located within military premises, saying the commission was investigating the reports.\"If we find that it is true, we shall take the necessary measures to address it,\" he added.On Tuesday, the authorities cut internet access and limited mobile services across the country in order to curb \"misinformation, disinformation, electoral fraud and related risks\". The network outage has heightened concerns about repression in the run-up to the  vote, and has been described by the UN human rights office as \"deeply worrying\".",

    "body": "At least 32 killed after crane collapses on train in Thailand7 hours agoJoel Guinto,Jonathan Head,South East Asia Correspondent, BangkokandJessica RawnsleyWatch: Emergency responders clamber over mangled train after crane collapseAt least 32 people have been killed and 66 others injured after a construction crane fell onto a moving train in north-east Thailand.The crane derailed the train and crushed some of its carriages, one of which caught fire. A one-year-old and an 85-year-old are among those injured, with seven people in critical condition, say authorities.Officials say some 171 passengers were on board the train when the accident occurred at around 09:00 local time (02:00 GMT). Thai state railways says it is taking legal action against the construction company responsible for the crane. The Italian-Thai Development Company expressed regret, saying it would compensate families of the dead and injured.The train had been travelling from Bangkok to north-eastern Ubon Ratchathani province when the accident occurred. It was carrying mostly students and workers travelling for school and work in other districts.Local outlet The Nation reported that the incident occurred while the crane was lifting a large concrete section which dropped on to the train, causing several coaches to derail.One survivor, train staff member Thirasak Wongsoongnern, told local media that he and the other passengers were thrown into the air after the crane fell on them.An eyewitness, Maliwan Nakthon, told BBC Thai that she witnessed the moment the crane collapsed. \"There were small pieces, like fragments of concrete, that started falling,\" she said. \"After those fell, the crane slowly slid down and hit. It struck hard, and then it came down and crushed the train.\"The whole incident took less than one minute,\" she added.'Grim scene': BBC on site after crane collapses on train in ThailandThai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who is due to visit the scene later on Wednesday, called for \"someone [to] be punished and held accountable\" for the incident, which is being investigated.\"Accidents like this can only happen due to negligence, skipped steps, deviations from the design, or the use of incorrect materials,\" Anutin said.The crane was being used to build an overhead railway that is part of a US$5.4bn (£4bn) China-backed project to link Bangkok with neighbouring Laos, where a Chinese-built high-speed line is already running to south-western China.Known officially as the Bangkok-Nong Khai HSR Development for Regional Connectivity, the Italian-Thai Development Company is listed as the firm in charge of the Lam Takhong-Sikhio section where the incident took place.The State Railway of Thailand has announced that it is suing the company. The initial cost of damages for the train carriages alone is reported to be more than 100 million baht (US$3.1m).ReutersConstruction work had been going on when the train travelling past was hitOne of Thailand's biggest contractors, the company was responsible for the construction of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed last March during an earthquake. Last year the company's president and several designers and engineers were charged with professional negligence over that incident. Some have denied wrongdoing. The Chinese embassy in Thailand said that no Chinese construction companies or workers were involved in the collapse, Chinese state media reported.Thailand is no stranger to deadly construction accidents, due in part to weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations.In 2023, a freight train collided with a pick-up truck that was crossing railway tracks in the country's east, killing eight people and injuring four others.Around 150 people have been killed over the past seven years in numerous accidents on a road improvement project from Bangkok to the south of the country.ReutersA worker on the train described being thrown into the air at the moment of impactCorrection: This article was amended to reflect that 100 million baht is $3.1m.

    "body": "20 hours agoWedaeli ChibelushiAPP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAcross North Africa, the Amazigh people have been coming together to usher in the year 2976.They have, unfortunately, not cracked time travel. Rather, they are almost a thousand years ahead of much of the world because they follow a calendar that starts at 950 BC, when King Sheshonq ascended the throne of Egypt.The Amazigh new year, known as Yennayer, begins between 12 and 14 January - depending on the area in which they live in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya - so over the last few days families have been laying on huge feasts, lighting bonfires and playing traditional music. Calls of \"aseggas ameggaz\", or happy new year, have been ringing through villages and busy city streets, while vibrant, meticulously embroidered traditional clothing has been donned for the occasion.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAmazigh culture and language has gained greater recognition over the past decadeThe Amazigh (which means \"free people\" or \"noble people\") are a range of ethnic groups that are North Africa's original inhabitants, having occupied the region since the beginning of recorded history.The exact size of the population is not known because of a dearth of official statistics, but according to estimates there are tens of millions of Amazigh people living across North Africa. Algeria and Morocco have the biggest populations - the latter is thought to be 40% Amazigh.Yennayer centres on family gatherings, celebrating renewal and the deep connection the Amazigh people have traditionally had with nature.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThese days Yennayer is marked with parades, concerts and carnivalsBecause the Amazigh are a diverse group, traditional Yennayer food differs from country to country and area to area. In Morocco's High Atlas region, \"ourkemen\", a rich mixture of legumes, spices and whole grains, is a new year's favourite.Many families in Algeria enjoy \"trèze\", a combination of sweets, dried fruit and nuts, after the main meal. The snack mix is sometimes gently thrown over the youngest child in a symbol of prosperity.But Yennayer is not just a family thing. It can also be celebrated with the wider community - parades, concerts and carnivals take the new year's spirit out on to the streets.Such proud displays of Amazigh culture are particularly significant as the community has a long history of being marginalised.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesFood, including couscous, is an important aspect of the new year celebrationsIn the 7th Century, as Arab conquerors swept across North Africa, they brought with them their language and the Islamic religion.Both of these were adopted officially, at the expense of Amazigh languages and culture.For instance, during Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's rule of Libya, the Amazigh language Tamazight was banned in schools and parents were not even allowed to give their children Amazigh names.However, thanks to the dogged campaigning of Amazigh activists, their culture and language has seen greater recognition over the past decade.In 2011, Morocco recognised Tamazight as an official language. Both Algeria and Morocco also declared Yennayer a public holiday, in 2017 and 2023 respectively.So Yennayer marks not just a victory for the Amazigh people, but also a reminder of centuries-long fight that has got the community to where it is now - in 2976.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesYennayer is now a public holiday in Algeria and MoroccoGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

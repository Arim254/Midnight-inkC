    "body": "1 day agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled in December when it convicted him. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied, including sedition under a separate colonial-era law.  The most serious one, colluding with foreign forces, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.On 9 February, the court jailed him for 20 years in a hearing that lasted less than 30 minutes. It is the harshest sentence given so far under the NSL - \"an effective death sentence\", given his age, according to rights groups.    \"Never,\" Lai had said to the charge of collusion when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".His conviction in December was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

    "body": "1 hour agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesSinger Chappell Roan says she has left the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman, whose name appears in the Epstein files.Announcing her split with the agency, Roan said she has a \"duty to protect her team\" and her decision reflected her belief that \"meaningful change in our industry requires accountability\".Wasserman has been criticised after his flirtatious emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, sent in 2003, were revealed among the millions of files published in relation to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Roan made no mention of Epstein, nor the Epstein files, in her statement on Instagram announcing her departure.\"As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,\" she said. Roan added: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\" The BBC has reached out to Wasserman for comment.Wasserman is also the chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, and has faced calls to step down from the position following the release of the emails.He said in a statement that his correspondence with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Who is in the Epstein files?Wasserman also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" he said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Roan's announcement comes after two other bands represented by Wasserman released statements indicating they wanted to distance themselves from his agency.Wednesday, a self-described indie rock band, said they were \"aghast\" to see Wasserman feature in the Epstein files and did not want to continue to be associated with him. They said that they hoped he would step down \"for the sake of his staff\".Rock band Beach Bunny said they were \"hugely disappointed and disgusted\" that Wasserman \"had involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoTiffanie TurnbullSydneyGetty ImagesThe erotic age-gap novel sexually objectifies children, a judge has saidAn Australian author has been found guilty of creating child sex abuse material in the form of an erotic age-gap romance novel.A New South Wales (NSW) court heard the book explores a relationship between 18-year-old Lucy and her father's 45-year-old best friend Arthur - detailing the much-older man's desires which began when the protagonist was a child as well as passages where she roleplays as a toddler.Lauren Mastrosa, a marketing executive for a Christian charity, was charged after the book sparked outrage online but in court she argued Lucy is clearly identified as an adult in the novel.However, Magistrate Bree Chisholm on Tuesday found Mastrosa's story \"sexually objectifies children\".Mastrosa, 34, issued an advance release of the novel - which the BBC has chosen not to name - to 21 readers in March last year before a complaint about its content was made to police.Chisholm read the whole book, published under the pen name Tori Woods, and found a reasonable reader would find it \"undeniably offensive\".Throughout the novel - the cover of which is pastel pink with the title spelled out in children's alphabet blocks - the protagonist uses child-like language, wears children's clothing, and engages in child-like behaviour.Chisholm said any references to the character being 18 were insufficient to overcome the implication of her as a child.\"Importantly, those descriptions and language are used in the portions of the book to describe a character similar to a young child when the sexual activity is occurring,\" Chisholm said, according to the Australian Associated Press.\"The reader is left with a description that creates the visual image in one's mind of an adult male engaging in sexual activity with a young child.\"Found guilty of one count each of creating, possessing and distributing child abuse material, Mastrosa will return to court to be sentenced on 28 April.When Mastrosa was charged, BaptistCare told the Daily Telegraph she had been stood down from her role pending an investigation.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNardine SaadAFP via Getty ImagesThe Gordie Howe International Bridge will connect southern Detroit, Michigan, USA, and Windsor, Ontario, Canada when completedPresident Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of a bridge connecting the US and Canada until Washington is \"fully compensated for everything\" it has given to its northern neighbour.The Gordie Howe International Bridge, connecting the Canadian province of Ontario to the US state of Michigan, would not open until Ottawa \"treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve\", Trump wrote on social media.According to the project's website, the bridge is being funded by the Canadian government but will be publicly owned by both Canada and Michigan.It is not clear how Trump could block its opening but he said negotiations would begin immediately, without elaborating.Spanning the Detroit River, the bridge is expected to open to traffic pending formal tests and approvals in early 2026. Construction began in 2018, but the project has been a point of contention between the countries for more than a decade.It is estimated to have cost $6.4bn CAD (£3.4bn), according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In the statement on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that the US should own \"at least one half of this asset\". He also suggested that Canada owned both the Canadian and US sides of the bridge.The organisation developing the bridge, the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, is wholly owned by the Canadian government, according to the project's website.Trump wrote: \"The Canadian Government expects me, as President of the United States, to PERMIT them to just 'take advantage of America!'\"\"I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" he added.The Moroun family - the American owners of the neighbouring Ambassador Bridge that also connects Detroit to Canada - appealed to Trump during his first term to stop construction of the new bridge, arguing that it infringed on their exclusive ability to collect tolls. In response, Trump and then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a joint statement saying the bridge was a \"vital economic link\" between the countries. Trump on Monday pointed to recent trade disputes between the two countries, saying that \"the Tariffs Canada charges us for our Dairy products have, for many years, been unacceptable\". Trump continued: \"The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.\"Canada's bridge authority, the Ontario premier's office and the Detroit mayor's office did not immediately response to requests for comment.

    "body": "7 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesAward-winning actress Catherine O'Hara died of a pulmonary embolism, her death certificate in the US has revealed. O'Hara died on 30 January in a Los Angeles hospital, at the age of 71. In addition to the blood clot in her lungs, the death certificate listed rectal cancer as the long-term cause of death. It was indicated that she had been receiving treatment for the cancer since March 2025. Tributes have poured in for the Canadian actress, who most recently appeared in the Emmy-winning comedy The Studio and The Last of Us.O'Hara rememberedActor and The Studio creator Seth Rogen said he was devastated by O'Hara's death, describing the actress as \"hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous\". \"We're all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it,\" he said.Actor Pedro Pascal, who worked with O'Hara on The Last of Us, wrote on Instagram: \"Oh, genius to be near you. Eternally grateful. There is less light in my world, this lucky world that had you, will keep you, always.\"The actress starred in six seasons of comedy series Schitt's Creek, for which she won an Emmy for best comedy actress. Show creator and co-star Eugene Levy told People magazine that he has had the \"honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O'Hara for over fifty years\".\"Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today,\" he said. Co-creator Dan Levy, who played O'Hara's son David, described her as \"family before she ever played my family\".He added on Instagram that he would \"cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her\".O'Hara's on-screen son in holiday classics Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, Macaulay Culkin, also paid an emotional tribute on Instagram.\"Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you,\" he wrote.\"I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later.\"O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch, her sons Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings.What is a pulmonary embolism?According to the NHS, a pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood vessel in the lungs is blocked by a blood clot.Symptoms include a sudden difficulty in breathing, chest pain that increases when breathing and coughing up blood.

    "body": "2 hours agoJoel GuintoandVirma SimonetteGetty ImagesThe Philippine Supreme Court in a landmark decision has ruled that same-sex couples can be considered co-owners of property.Applying a provision of the country's Family Code for the first time, the court said same-sex couples can be recognised as co-owners if it is proven that both parties contributed to acquiring a property.Same-sex unions are outlawed in conservative Catholic Philippines and it is the only country in the world, outside of the Vatican, that does not allow divorce.This has left LGBT couples without legal protections when it comes to property, finance and healthcare.The Supreme Court ruling, which was made public on Tuesday, involved a former couple - two women - who had feuded over plans to sell their house and lot in suburban Manila.One of the women refused to sell their house after initially agreeing to do so, leading the other to file a claim before a lower court asking to divide their property. The lower court denied the claim, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.But the Supreme Court on 5 February reversed the lower court rulings. It cited a document made by one partner - and acknowledged by the other - that she paid 50% of the purchase and renovation costs.The property was registered under the name of only one of the partners to make the paperwork during the acquisition faster, since they were not married or related by blood.While the Family Code defines marriage as a bond between a man and a woman, the court said Article 148 - which governs \"property relations of people who live together but cannot legally marry\" - does not discriminate based on gender and \"applies to all forms of co-habitation\".Article 148 applies to same-sex couples, \"otherwise, we render legally invisible some forms of legitimate intimate relationships\", said Associate Justice Marvic Leonen.Associate Justice Amy Lazaro Javier further noted that Article 148 must not be limited to heterosexual couples \"given the prevailing values in modern society as well as the glaring yet unjustified difference in the treatment of heterosexual couples vis-à-vis their homosexual counterparts\".A spokesperson for the Supreme Court, Camille Ting, confirmed to the BBC that it is the first time Article 148 of the Family Code has been used to decide on a case regarding property rights of a same-sex couple.The court in its decision also called on government and lawmakers to address the needs of same-sex couples.\"With the political, moral, and cultural questions that surround the issue concerning the rights of same-sex couples, political departments especially the Congress must be involved to quest for solutions,\" the court said.",

    "body": "Savannah Guthrie pleads for help finding missing mother as purported ransom deadline passes7 hours agoMax MatzaWatch: \"We are at an hour of desperation\", says Guthrie in new plea for missing motherA purported ransom deadline for the safe return of Savannah Guthrie's mother has passed, shortly after the US news anchor issued a fresh plea for help.In a video posted on Instagram, Guthrie said her family is \"at an hour of desperation\".As the Monday deadline of 17:00 local time (00:00 GMT) approached, officials said they had still not identified a suspect or person of interest in the investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and was last seen on 31 January. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.ReutersThe FBI said they are not aware of \"any continued communication between the Guthrie family and suspected kidnappers\". It is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for any information. The FBI also said it is taking an email with a ransom note sent to US media outlets stating the Monday deadline seriously, the BBC's US partner CBS reported.A previous alleged deadline for ransom, which was meant to be paid in Bitcoin, passed on 5 February. Nancy Guthrie was reported missing when she did not attend a Sunday church service on 1 February and other members grew concerned.The family has released three previous videos saying they were willing to speak to the potential kidnapper, and asking to provide proof that her mother was alive.The family had earlier indicated that they would be willing to pay for her safe return.\"I just want to share a few thoughts as we enter another week of this nightmare,\" Guthrie says, appearing alone in the latest video, in contrast to previous recordings where she has appeared with her siblings.   \"She was taken, and we don't know where. And we need your help,\" Guthrie says.Guthrie requests people everywhere, \"even if you're far from Tucson\", to report anything suspicious that could lead to clues about her mother.She continues: \"If you see anything, if you hear anything, if there's anything at all that seems strange to you, that you report to law enforcement\".In an update just before Monday's deadline, the Pima County Sheriff's Office said it did not have any new information to release publicly. The sheriff's statement added that the \"investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance remains active and ongoing\", and that \"the FBI is handling all aspects related to any ransom note(s) or communications involving the Guthrie family\".The FBI also released a statement, saying that FBI agents from around the country \"continue to deploy to Tucson\".\"We are currently operating a 24-hour command post that includes crisis management experts, analytic support, and investigative teams. But we still need the public's help,\" the FBI statement added, including the number for the FBI's tip line.'We will pay': Savannah Guthrie's new message about missing motherAt a news briefing last week, FBI Special Agent Heith Janke said his agency was reviewing a ransom note sent to several media outlets.The note gave a deadline for payment of 17:00 on Thursday, he said, without specifying which time zone, and had a second deadline for Monday.On Monday, FBI Director Kash Patel arrived in Tucson, on a trip that was scheduled prior to Guthrie's disappearance.

    "body": "19 hours agoJack BurgessWorld Without ExploitationSurvivors appeared in the advert with black redaction marks over their mouthsSurvivors of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have appeared in an advert calling for the release of more files related to him.In the 40 second video from the World Without Exploitation group, released in the US on Super Bowl Sunday, survivors held up photographs of their younger selves and said \"we all deserve the truth\".The US Department of Justice (DOJ) was required by law to make all the files public in December last year. However, only some have been released - many with redactions.The DOJ said files not published were either unrelated, duplicates, or had been withheld under deliberative process or attorney-client privilege, or because they depicted violence.Deliberative process privilege allows US government agencies to withhold documents which reflect decision-making processes, while attorney-client privilege is intended to protect the confidentiality of communications between lawyers and clients.Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche said last month that the most recent release of material, on 30 January, \"marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process\".Blanche also said there was a \"built in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information of men that we know about that we're covering up or that we're not we're choosing not to prosecute\", before adding \"that is not the case\".Sunday's advert featuring the survivors began with a text slate on screen that said: \"On November 19, 2025, the Epstein Files Transparency Act was signed into law.\" It continued with a statement that said: \"3 MILLION FILES Still Have Not Been Released.\"The survivors appeared with black redaction marks over their mouths, addressed the camera directly and each said \"we're standing together\". The advert concluded with a call for people to \"stand with us\" and \"Tell Attorney General Pam Bondi IT'S TIME FOR THE TRUTH\".While the video was released on the day of the Super Bowl it was not aired on television during the match, which traditionally has the largest television audience in the US.The group told the Reuters news agency it could not afford to air a commercial during the game, noting that a 30-second Super Bowl advertisement can cost \"more than $8 million (£5.9m)\".The DOJ's release of documents has shed light on the disgraced financier's close association with many prominent people. However, the justice department has faced heavy scrutiny after missing the 19 December deadline to release all files as mandated in the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed Congress and was signed into law in November.Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is scheduled to appear before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files on Monday.She has agreed to testify under oath but her legal team previously said she would decline to answer questions under her constitutional right to remain silent unless she is granted legal immunity.",

    "body": "11 hours agoTom McArthurLev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty ImagesPolice in Norway have opened an investigation into a high-profile diplomat and her husband over their links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Mona Juul resigned as ambassador to Jordan and Iraq on Sunday, days after she was suspended following Norwegian media reports that each of her children would receive $5m (£3.6m) in a will allegedly signed by Epstein days before he died.Emails released in the so-called Epstein files also appear to show that Juul's husband, Terje Rød-Larsen, had dinner with Epstein in Paris in June 2019, weeks before Epstein's arrest in the US on sex trafficking charges.Juul's lawyer has said she \"does not recognise the accusations made against her\" and Rød-Larsen's lawyer said he is confident the investigation will clarify \"there is no basis for criminal liability\".Appearing in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.Norway's foreign ministry has said Juul's contact with Epstein revealed a \"serious lapse in judgement\".An \"aggravated corruption\" inquiry has been launched by the Norwegian economic crime unit Økokrim, police announced on Monday.\"Økokrim will, among other things, investigate whether benefits were received in connection with her position,\" police said in a statement, referring to Juul.A property in Oslo has been searched in connection with the investigation.Juul and Rød-Larsen were part of a small group of diplomats that negotiated the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, which at the time were seen as a breakthrough in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.Norwegian media reports Rød-Larsen had extensive communication with Epstein and arranged to meet him with Juul more than once.The wider Epstein documents, released by the US Department of Justice last month, contain millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into the late sex offender - who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.Juul is the latest prominent public figure from the Nordic country to be drawn into the widening scandal surrounding the contents of the files, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland, and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende.The WEF ordered an independent review into Brende – who also served as the Norwegian foreign minister - over his interactions with the paedophile.Brende has acknowledged dining with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019 and communicating with him by email and text. He said he welcomes the WEF's decision to launch a review.Correction 9 February: An earlier version of this article carried a picture of Danish politician Mona Juul, who is not the subject of this story.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAmy WalkerGetty ImagesTemperatures are rising after days of extreme cold and snow in the city A total of 18 people have died as a result of a period of extreme cold weather in New York City, its mayor has said.Since late January, the city has endured a cold snap, including 13 days of temperatures of 0C (32F) or below – one of the longest stretches of sub-zero weather New York has seen in six decades.Over the weekend, another person \"lost their life on the streets of our city,\" Zohran Mamdani said on Monday, adding that \"each life lost is a tragedy, and we will continue to hold their families in our thoughts\".While temperatures are set to rise this week, they remain below average, with Mamdani telling residents to \"stay safe, stay indoors... [and] keep looking out for one another\".The mayor added that since 19 January, when a Code Blue emergency was announced - which relaxed intake policies for homeless shelters - about 1,400 placements had been made into shelters.An additional 64 hotel rooms had been added to the city's shelter capacity, with at least another 150 outreach workers on the streets, said Mamdani.On 27 January, Mamdani said at least 10 of the people who had died were found outdoors. The circumstances of the other deaths are not known.\"We have been working hard to keep New Yorkers safe, and we will continue to do so. Because it is not forecast to be above 32 degrees [Fahrenheit] until tomorrow, and 35 degrees is hardly balmy weather,\" he said.Getty ImagesNew York City was under an extreme cold warning over the weekendThe US National Weather Service (NWS) said temperatures would increase to about 0C for the most part of the week, following persistent freezing temperatures on Monday. It added that highs were normally around 4C at this time in the year.An Arctic airmass brought hazardous sub-zero \"wind chills\" - the temperature it feels like rather than the temperature it is - to the region over the weekend, bringing a risk of hypothermia and frostbite, the forecaster said.NYC's Emergency Management agency said that following days of extreme cold and snow pose serious safety risks remained across the city.It warned that melting snow and ice could fall from buildings without warning and that streets and pavements could refreeze overnight.",

    "body": "Australia police defend actions after violence at protest over Israeli president visit4 hours agoLana LamandKaty Watson,SydneyWatch: BBC reports from Sydney as police use pepper spray on pro-Palestine protestAustralian police have defended their actions after violently clashing with protesters during a demonstration against a visit by the Israeli president.Video emerged of police charging and punching protesters during the rally in Sydney on Monday night, with a state parliament MP among those who said they were injured in the clashes. Police said 27 people were arrested, with nine later charged, and 10 officers assaulted.Officers showed \"remarkable restraint\", NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said Tuesday, adding they \"did what they needed to do\".Earlier, rally organisers had failed in their court bid to overturn police powers limiting their right to demonstrate during Isaac Herzog's visit.The government invited Herzog to visit Australia after an antisemitic attack at Bondi Beach, saying it would help the Jewish community heal, despite objections from pro-Palestinian groups.Fifteen people, including a ten-year-old girl, were killed on 14 December after two gunmen shot at crowds at an event celebrating the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.Video footage of the protests outside Sydney's Town Hall and surrounding areas - police said 6,000 attended while organisers said it was 50,000 - appeared to show several physical confrontations between police and protesters, including officers punching protesters and dragging away Muslim men who were praying. Josh Lees from the Palestine Action Group said the violence at the protest on Monday evening was the \"worst\" he has seen in recent years.\"We should have had the right to march,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio.He said \"all of this could have been avoided\" if the New South Wales (NSW) government had allowed the group to march from Town Hall to either the state parliament or Hyde Park.NSW introduced restrictions on public protest after December's shooting, and a few days before Monday's rally introduced additional \"major event\" powers effectively giving police authority to shut down areas of the city. The rules allowed demonstrators to gather but forbade them from marching.Protesters lost a legal bid to overturn the major event powers application just half an hour before the protest.NSW Police and Greens member respond to force used in Sydney protestNSW Premier Chris Minns defended the police response, telling Channel 9's Today programme that authorities had been \"put in an impossible situation last night\". He later urged the public \"not to look at a 10-second clip without the full context\".Assistant Commissioner Peter McKenna said police had been \"threatened, jostled and assaulted\" during \"a number of melees, rolling fights\" and authorities were \"significantly outnumbered by the protesters and the people who wanted to act in a violent and offensive manner\".Among the crowd last night was Jewish demonstrator Linda Feinberg, who came to show solidarity.\"I am appalled, it was a really damaging decision of Albanese to invite him [Herzog],\" she said, holding a placard that read \"Jews say no to genocide\".Sihal Jamila came with her young daughter.\"It's very important for me to be here, I'm the mother of two and one on the way,\" she told the BBC, her voice cracking. \"They're killing our children. This is ridiculous.\"The speeches at Town Hall were peaceful, but tensions mounted afterwards when protesters began chanting \"let us march\" and police closed in.As the atmosphere became fraught, pepper spray was deployed, which sent protesters running, but they were unable to leave the area due to police lines.GettyThousands of people attended a rally on Sydney on Monday night against a visit by Israeli President Isaac Herzog.Minns said police had needed to keep protesters away from people attending an event with Herzog at a nearby convention centre.Another protest is planned for Tuesday evening outside a Sydney police station, with organisers calling for charges against protesters to be dropped and for police officers who had used physical force to be investigated.The Australian National Imams Council said the footage of Muslims men being dragged away while they were praying was \"shocking, deeply disturbing, and entirely unacceptable\".NSW Greens MP Abigail Boyd - who posted a photo of herself in a neck brace - said she was pushed and shoved by police at the protests despite telling them she was a member of parliament.\"I got pushed so hard my feet left the ground after I told them I was a member of parliament,\" she said.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who is to meet Herzog later on Tuesday, said he was \"devastated\" by the scenes, saying they \"shouldn't be taking place,\" but defended the invitation to Herzog and said protesters \"undermined\" their cause at the protest.Pro-Palestinian groups had objected to Herzog's visit, citing a UN commission last year which concluded that Herzog was among Israeli leaders who \"incited the commission of genocide\" against Palestinians in their speeches and statements.It came after Herzog said \"it's an entire nation out there that is responsible\" for the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, and was also pictured signing a shell to be dropped on Gaza. His comments formed part of the legal case brought by South Africa in the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.Herzog has condemned the UN report, which he said took his words out of context, while the Israeli foreign minister called it \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesThai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul's Bhumjaithai party achieved a stunning victory in the February electionAs the dust from what has been a hard-fought election campaign in Thailand settles, many Thais may be rubbing their eyes and asking, \"what just happened?\".Most of the opinion polls published before the election predicted a win for the progressive People's Party. Some suggested it would get more than 200 seats in parliament, a significant improvement on its already impressive 2023 result when it won 151. Few polls put the party of Prime Minister Anutin Chanrvirakul ahead.Yet once most of the votes had been counted, it was clear Anutin had achieved a stunning victory, and the young reformists had suffered a big setback. With a projected share of more than 190 seats, the path of Anutin's Bhumjaithai party is clear to form the next government, albeit with coalition partners.So why did a youthful, progressive party with an imaginative and tech-savvy campaign do so poorly compared to a transactional, old-style party with little ideological identity aside from strong loyalty to the monarchy?A harder race for the reformistsThe mixed voting system played a part. People in Thailand cast two ballots, one for a candidate in their constituency, and one for the party they prefer.At the national level the People's Party, with nearly 10 million votes, did much better in the party list than Bhumjaithai, with just under six million votes, although this was still a big drop compared to the more than 14 million Move Forward, the previous incarnation of the People's Party, won in 2023. But the party list accounts for only 20% of the 500 seats in parliament.As many as 80% of the seats are allocated by local contests, where whichever candidate get the most votes in each constituency wins the seat on a first-past-the-post basis. This is where the People's Party, which is relatively new and urban-based, is weaker because it lacks rural networks. Bhumjaithai, by comparison, is a past master at using its substantial resources to win local power-brokers to its side, and they exercise a lot of influence over voters in their areas. Anutin has used the defections of political veterans from other parties to grow Bhumjaithai from a medium-sized provincial movement which won only 51 seats in 2019, to a national-level election-winning powerhouse today.It was also harder for the reformists to distinguish themselves on a single issue this time. In 2023, after nine years being ruled by the stern, avuncular Prayuth Chan-ocha, the general who led the 2014 coup, there was a broad yearning for change, and the Move Forward party, under its suave, telegenic leader Pita Limjaroenrat, promised no deals with \"the uncles\" – those involved in the coup. This captured the imagination of the public, and there was a last-minute wave of support for them. In this election, there was no such defining issue, and the party had been forced to drop its campaign to amend the harsh lese majeste law after this was used by the courts to justify dissolving Move Forward and banning its leaders from politics.Anutin was also able to coalesce conservative support around his party, as opposed to having their voters split among several parties in 2023. His strident nationalism over the border conflict with Cambodia, his staunch support for the army and his intense loyalty to King Vajiralongkorn all defined him clearly as the standard-bearer for Thai conservatism.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls had projected a win for the progressive People's PartyAnother big factor was the steep decline in the fortunes of Pheu Thai, the once unbeatable election machine backed by former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. It came second in 2023, with 141 seats, but is likely to see that total halved this time round after the past three years of political turmoil in which two of its prime ministers were dismissed by the constitutional court, and it was accused of mishandling relations with Cambodia. Thaksin has been jailed on old corruption charges, and could face further criminal complaints. Back in 2023, Pheu Thai lost support to Move Forward. This time, Bhumjaithai and other conservative parties were the beneficiaries of Pheu Thai's falling popularity in its old strongholds of the north and north-east.Some in the reformist camp will look back on their party's controversial decision to back Anutin to become prime minister last September, after the fall of the second Pheu Thai administration. At the time, the People's Party justified this strange alliance with its ideological opposite by promising not to join his government, and by extracting from him a pledge to hold a referendum on changing the military-drafted constitution, a priority for the reformists.But by not insisting on cabinet positions in return for their votes in parliament, the People's Party allowed Anutin to fill his cabinet with capable technocrats, burnishing his credentials as a can-do leader. And while the constitutional referendum was indeed held at the same time as the election on Sunday, and produced a clear vote in favour of changing it, the process of drafting and approving a new charter is so protracted it might be indefinitely delayed. Some now see this as a poor decision, which tarnished their reputation among more idealistic followers.In the end, though, the reformists always had a mountain to climb to get into government. Many of their leaders have already been banned from politics, their party has been dissolved twice, and one of their best members of parliament is likely to go to jail for six years on lese majeste charges. Even after their election loss, another 44 of their leading members now face bans from politics by the Supreme Court for supporting the proposal by Move Forward to soften the punishments under the lese majeste law.These impediments may well have disillusioned some of the voters who backed Move Forward three years ago. Turnout in this election at 65% was sharply down from the 75% seen in 2023.Anutin will face no such impediments. The many means by which elected governments, parties and politicians can be constrained by unelected bodies – the \"handcuffs\" on Thai democracy – have only ever been used on those challenging the status quo. Provided he can make terms with smaller coalition partners, the prime minister has a good chance of completing a full four-year term, something no civilian leader has managed to do in Thailand for 20 years.",

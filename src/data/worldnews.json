    "body": "7 hours agoHugh Schofield,ParisandLaura GozziA former anaesthetist has been jailed for life for intentionally poisoning 30 patients, 12 of them fatally.Frédéric Péchier, 53,  was convicted Friday at the end of a four-month trial in the eastern city of Besançon.In one of France's biggest ever medical malpractice cases, Péchier was found to have introduced chemicals like potassium chloride or adrenaline into the infusion bags of patients. His youngest victim, a four-year-old child, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"The chemicals Péchier added triggered cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients, which required emergency intervention in the operating theatre.This was often provided by Péchier himself, who was then able to pose as the patient's saviour.But in 12 cases he was unable to intervene, or it was too late, and the patient died.The prosecution argued that Péchier acted in order to discredit fellow anaesthetists against whom he bore a grudge.In most of the operations, he was not the primary anaesthetist. It was alleged he came in early to the clinic to tamper with the infusion bags.Then, when things went wrong, he was able to step in after diagnosing the problem and ordering an antidote.Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. The alert was raised in 2017 after a surfeit of potassium chloride was found in the infusion bag of a woman who had a heart attack while being operated on for a back complaint.Investigators found a pattern of \"serious adverse events\" at the Saint-Vincent private clinic in Besançon. While the national average for fatal heart attacks under anaesthetic was 1 in 100,000, at the clinic it was more than six times that.And in most cases nationally, an explanation for the heart attack was subsequently found, whereas at Saint-Vincent the cause remained a mystery.It was also found that the \"serious adverse events\" ceased when Péchier left for a short period to work at another clinic, which itself then saw an uptick. Then when he returned to Saint-Vincent, the emergencies resumed there. When he was disbarred from practising in 2017, the anomaly stopped.Péchier's first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. \"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.According to the trial prosecutor: \"His colleagues said he always seemed to have the answer. That he made himself out to be the best, that he created this character of the saviour, so that colleagues would instinctively turn to him.\"Péchier denied the charges and his lawyers argued that there was no hard proof linking him to the crimes. But his own testimony varied in the trial, and he ended up admitting there must have been a poisoner at large in the clinic, but it was not him.The son of two parents in the medical profession, Péchier was described by a court psychologist as having a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality – one side respectable, the other side capable of doing great harm. In 2014 and again in 2021 he made attempts to kill himself.A divorced father of three children, he told the court before the verdict that his sole concern was to protect his family. His children wept as the sentence was read but he remained impassive.\"It's the end of a nightmare,\" said survivor Sandra Simard. Another patient who survived, Jean-Claude Gandon, said: \"We can have an easier Christmas now.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterThe firm behind President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform is merging with a Google-backed energy company in a deal valued at more than $6bn (£4.4bn).Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and TAE Technologies announced the plans on Thursday in a joint statement, which said the move would \"create one of the world's first publicly traded fusion companies\".Fusion power is a method of generating energy from heat released by nuclear fusion reactions. It could release vast amounts of energy with little associated radioactivity.The statement said the combined company planned to begin constructing the \"world's first utility-scale fusion power plant\" next year, with further plants to follow.Under the merger both firms will have an equal 50% share in ownership after the deal is completed, which is expected by mid-2026 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals.The combined company will have a nine-member board including Trump Media's current chief executive Devin Nunes, who will be co-chief executive of the new firm, and the president's son Donald Trump Jr.TAE Technologies provides technology for energy storage and power delivery systems for batteries and electric vehicles. Its umbrella organisation, TAE Life Sciences, develops technologies and drugs for treating cancer patients.The tie-up with the firm signals a bold and surprising shift for Trump Media, as it moves from social media and financial offerings into the energy sector. Mr Nunes said his firm was \"taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations\". Calling fusion power the \"most dramatic energy breakthrough\" since the 1950s, he said Trump Media would bring \"the capital and public market access\" to help make TAE's technology commercial viable. As part of the agreement, Trump Media is to provide up to $200m (£149m) of cash to TAE Technologies when completion of the deal is signed. An additional $100m (£74.7m) will be available once the transaction has been registered.Surging electricity demand for AI data centers has revived interest in cleaner and reliable nuclear power, including restarting shuttered reactors, expanding existing ones and signing contracts for future small modular reactors.The joint statement said TAE Technologies had raised more than $1.3bn of funding from other investors including Google and Goldman Sachs.Trump Media, which mainly generates revenue from advertising on the Truth Social platform, has consistently clocked losses since it began. It posted a decline in revenue and a loss of $54.8m (£40.9m) in the third quarter ending September.",

    "body": "The Academy Awards will begin streaming exclusively on YouTube in 2029, the latest big change in Hollywood. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made the announcement on Wednesday, saying that it signed a multi-year deal that will give YouTube the exclusive global rights to the Oscars until 2033. The Oscars, which is planned for 15 March, has aired for a half a century on ABC. Starting in 2029, the show will be available live and for free on YouTube. It's another big shakeup in Hollywood, which is dealing with studio sales and mergers, along with steep production cuts.\"The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible - which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community,\" Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor said in a statement. Over decades, viewership of the awards show has declined, though there was a slight uptick in 2025, with a significant number of younger viewers tuning in from cell phones and computers. In a statement, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan called the Oscars \"one of our essential cultural institutions\" and said that partnering with the Academy would \"inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy\". ABC, which has streamed the awards since 1976, said that it was looking forward \"to the next three telecasts\" it will still host.The move comes as Warner Bros Discovery on Wednesday recommended its shareholders reject a hostile takeover bid from Paramount Skydance for a rival bid from streaming giant Netflix. Both options were seen as unfavourable for an industry that has seen drastic cuts over the past several years. Like major studios, cable networks have faced issues as the public has opted for streaming services instead. YouTube winning rights to the Academy Awards further suggests that reliance on streaming sites will continue.",

    "body": "Dan Bongino has said he will leave his role as the FBI's deputy director in January.In a post on X, he thanked President Donald Trump, as well as the director of the FBI and the US attorney general \"for the opportunity to serve with purpose\". Bongino did not say in his post why he was stepping down.Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said the former podcast host \"did a great job\" in office, and \"wants to go back to his show\".Bongino, who was appointed to the role by Trump in February, built a large following through his podcast and other media appearances. He was previously a New York City police officer and a US Secret Service agent assigned to protect Barack Obama, the former president.Bongino, a staunch Trump ally, was considered a surprise pick for the role –  which had previously been held by career agents – because he had no prior experience with the agency.The FBI Agents Association, which represents around 14,000 current and former agents, had opposed his appointment to the position.Announcing his decision to step down in Wednesday's social media post, Bongino wrote: \"I will be leaving my position with the FBI in January. I want to thank President Trump, AG [Pam] Bondi, and Director [Kash] Patel for the opportunity to serve with purpose.\"Most importantly, I want to thank you, my fellow Americans, for the privilege to serve you. God bless America, and all those who defend Her.\"Before joining the agency, Bongino had echoed disinformation and conspiracy theories about Trump's false claim that he won the 2020 election, and about the 6 January 2021 pipe bomb investigation. Bongino had previously called the pipe bomb case an \"inside job\". After taking office he pushed to make the investigation, which Attorney General Bondi said had \"languished\", a priority for the FBI.Earlier this month, a man with no known ties to the government was arrested, nearly six years after the pipe bombs were discovered outside the national headquarters for the Republican and Democratic parties. FBI Director Patel, in a social media post on Wednesday praising Bongino's tenure, said he had \"served as the people's voice for transparency, and delivered major breakthroughs in long unsolved cases like the pipe bomb investigation\".\"He not only completed his mission - he far exceeded it,\" Patel wrote.Bongino also appeared to change his mind about the death of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein once he became a leader at the FBI.As a commentator, he had questioned whether Epstein took his own life in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial. Then, in May, Bongino said: \"I have seen the whole file. He killed himself\".In July, the US justice department and FBI released a memo that said Epstein did take his own life, and did not have a \"client list\".The memo frustrated many of Trump's supporters, who echoed the Epstein conspiracy theories and rejected the justice department's findings.According to the BBC's media partner CBS News, the memo led to a contentious meeting between him and Bondi.Bondi, who oversees the FBI, wrote in a brief post on X on Wednesday that \"Americans are safer\" because of Bongino's FBI service.",

    "body": "Wiz Khalifa sentenced to nine months jail in Romania for smoking cannabis on stage10 minutes agoMircea Barbu,BucharestandAndré Rhoden-PaulGetty ImagesA Romanian court has sentenced Wiz Khalifa to nine months in prison for smoking cannabis on stage.The American rapper, real name Thomaz Cameron Jibril, admitted to smoking a joint during his performance at the Beach, Please! festival last year in Costinesti.A Romanian appeals court overturned an earlier fine of 3,600 Romanian leu (£619; $829) for drug possession and ruled the rapper must serve the sentence in custody. However he was sentenced in abstentia, and it is unclear if Jibril is even in Romania - he was last seen on Tuesday, performing with Gunna in California.The BBC has approached the ten-time Grammy-nominated artist for comment. Police briefly held and questioned Jibril after the concert on 13 July 2024, and prosecutors later charged him with possession of \"risk drugs\" for personal use.  Romanian investigators said he was in possession of more than 18 grams of cannabis and consumed an additional amount on stage. In a written decision, the Constanța Court of Appeal judges said they overturned the original fine because the artist had sent \"a message of normalisation of illegal conduct\" and thereby encouraged \"drug use among young people\".Calling it an \"ostentatious act\", the judges said the rapper was \"a music performer, on the stage of a music festival well known among young people\" who \"possessed and consumed, in front of a large audience predominantly made up of very young people, an artisanal cigarette\".Jabril said in a post on X a day after the incident that he did not mean to offend the country. \"They [the authorities] were very respectful and let me go. I'll be back soon. But without a big ass joint next time.\" Romanian criminologist Vlad Zaha told BBC News that there was little-to-no chance of the US extraditing Jibril, and described the sentence as \"unusually harsh\". \"Given the defendant's wealth and connections, Romania's lack of real negotiating power on extradition, and the legal and political status of cannabis in the US, it is highly unlikely that Wiz Khalifa will be sent to serve a prison sentence in Constanța, even though a formal judicial request will be submitted to the United States,\" Mr Zaha said. The  artist, known for songs like Black and Yellow, See You Again and Young, Wild & Free, is often pictured smoking on his social media and founded his own marijuana brand in 2016. Cannabis is legal recreational and medical use in some US states, but remains illegal under federal law.",

    "body": "Thailand says it has bombed a \"logistics centre\" near the Cambodian town of Poipet, known for being a major casino hub and the biggest land crossing between the two countries.The bombings come as renewed border clashes show no sign of abating. Cambodia's defence ministry said Thai forces dropped two bombs, while the Thai side said that they targeted a facility storing rocket systems.The renewed fighting this month has killed at least 21 people in Thailand and 17 in Cambodia, while displacing around 800,000, officials say.In a statement, the Cambodian defence ministry said Thai forces dropped two bombs in the area of Poipet municipality at around 11:00 am (0400 GMT) Thursday.Shortly after, Thai Air Force spokesman Air Marshal Jackkrit Thammavichai said that the Thai military had attacked the centre outside Poipet that had been used to store BM-21 rockets and that no civilians were harmed.BM-21 rockets are weapons that are typically fired in volleys from the back of an armoured vehicle.The bombings appear to be the first on Poipet, which is known for casinos popular with Thai gamblers and its international border checkpoint.On Tuesday, Thailand said Tuesday that between 5,000 and 6,000 Thai nationals remained stranded in Poipet after Cambodia closed its land border crossings between the two countries.Cambodia's interior ministry said the border closures were a \"necessary measure\" to reduce risks to civilians, adding that air travel remained an option for those seeking to leave.The century-old border dispute between the South East Asian neighbours dramatically escalated on 24 July with a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. The two countries later agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump - who at the time threatened to stop tariff negotiations until the hostilities stopped.But that ceasefire fell apart again last week, with both sides blaming each other for re-igniting the fighting, which has seen air strikes and exchanges of artillery fire.Trump claimed last week that he could stop the fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces that broke out by just picking up the phone, but it has continued.Earlier this week, Cambodia accused Thai forces of bombing Siem Reap province, home to the ancient Angkor temples - the country's top tourist draw - for the first time in the latest round of clashes.",

But he was also well known for his work at CNN, having become a household name while reporting on the first Gulf War.His career spanned decades and covered several conflicts in countries including Iraq, Vietnam and El Salvador.The New Zealand-born journalist died on Wednesday surrounded by family and friends in California, his son told reporters.

Writing about the experience in the Roanoke Times, Arnett said he had decided to be \"as tough in my questioning as the situation would allow\".He continued: \"I was not intimidated by the prospect of encountering the man many had called 'The Butcher of Baghdad'. I figured he could do no worse to me than the constant bombing of Baghdad was threatening to do.\"AP Photo/Peter Arnett/FileArnett visited Pyongyang, North Korea, in 1979, taking this photograph of children performing for then-UN Secretary General Kurt WaldheimIn 1997, Arnett became the first Western journalist to interview Osama Bin Laden at a secret hideout in Afghanistan, a few years before the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US.According to several US media reports, when asked about his plans, Bin Laden told Arnett: \"You'll see them and hear about them in the media, God willing.\"Arnett later worked for NBC and was famously sacked by the broadcaster after giving an interview on Iraqi state television, in which he was seen as critical of US military strategy.He was hired by the Daily Mirror hours later and said he was \"in shock\" at his dismissal.\"I report the truth of what is happening here in Baghdad and will not apologise for it,\" he wrote in the UK paper.AP Photo/Peter Arnett/FileArnett provided an inside-look of what was happening in Vietnam throughout his careerBorn in 1934 in Riverton, New Zealand, Arnett later naturalised as an American citizen and had lived in southern California since 2014.Edith Lederer, a former colleague who still works at AP, told the agency: \"Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation - intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller.\"His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come.\"Meanwhile, Nick Ut, a retired photographer who worked with Arnett in Vietnam, said he was \"like a brother\".\"His death will leave a big hole in my life,\" he told AP.Arnett is survived by his wife Nina Nguyen and their children, Andrew and Elsa.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HousePresident Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will expand access to cannabis, a long anticipated move that would mark the most significant shift in US drug policy in decades. The order directs the US attorney general to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I narcotic, to a Schedule III drug - placing it under the same category as Tylenol with codeine. Cannabis will remain illegal at the federal level. But classifying it as a Schedule III narcotic would allow expanded research to be conducted into its potential benefits. Several Republican lawmakers cautioned against the move, with some arguing it could normalise cannabis use. The US Drug Enforcement Agency notes that Schedule III narcotics - which also include ketamine and anabolic steroids - have only a \"moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence\".The new classification also has tax implications for state-authorised cannabis dispensaries, as current regulations bar them from some tax deductions if they sell Schedule I products.In addition to the rescheduling of cannabis, Trump has ordered White House officials to work with Congress to allow some Americans access to to cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD. As part of a new programme announced as part of the order, some Medicaid recipients will be able to access CBD, at a doctor's recommendation, at no cost. Health officials have also been tasked with developing \"methods and models\" to examine the real-world health benefits and risks of CBD.A senior administration official said that the order was a \"commonsense action that will let us better understand and study\" cannabis and CBD. In recent years, a majority of US states have approved cannabis for some medical use, and nearly half - 24 - have legalised recreational use. But since 1971, cannabis has been  a Schedule I narcotic, which means it has no accepted medical use and a high potential to be abused.The Biden administration proposed a similar reclassification, and in April 2024 the DEA proposed a rule change, but got bogged down under administrative and legal issues. Trump has long expressed a desire to change US drug policy regarding cannabis. \"I believe it is time to end endless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,\" he wrote on Truth Social last year while running for president. \"We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested products,\" he said. The reclassification order has met some resistance from Republican lawmakers. On Wednesday, a group of 22 Republican Senators sent an open letter to the president, arguing that marijuana use would mean that \"we cannot re-industrialise America\". The Senators pointed to lingering concerns over the health impact of cannabis, as well as research suggesting that cannabis can be linked to \"impaired judgement\" and \"lack of concentration\".\"In light of the documented dangers of marijuana, facilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans.\" In a separate letter sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi in August, nine Republican representatives argued that \"no adequate science or data\" exists to support the change. \"Marijuana, while different than heroin, still has the potential for abuse and has no scientifically proven medical value,\" the letter said. \"Therefore, rescheduling marijuana would not only be objectively wrong, but it would also imply to our children that marijuana is safe. That couldn't be further from the truth.\"More broadly, polls show that a majority of Americans support efforts to legalise marijuana. One Gallup poll released in November found that 64% of Americans believe that it should be legalised, although support had drifted slightly from previous years because of a 13-point drop among Republicans.

    "body": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his government will crack down on hate speech following Sunday's deadly shooting at Bondi Beach that targeted a Jewish festival.Fifteen people were killed when two gunmen opened fire at an event to mark the first day of Hanukkah.New laws will target \"those who spread hate, division and radicalisation\", Albanese told reporters in Canberra. The home affairs minister will also be given new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate and a new taskforce will be set up to ensure the education system \"prevents, tackles and properly responds to antisemitism\".The new laws will also include penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence, a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\", and the introduction of \"hate\" as an aggravating factor in sentencing crimes for online threats and harassment.\"Every Jewish Australian has the right to feel safe, valued and respected for the contribution that they make to our great nation,\" Albanese said.\"The terrorists, inspired by ISIS... sought to turn Australians against each other. Australians have responded to that act of hatred with love and sympathy for those in mourning.\"Tensions have been high in the country since the shooting, with police detaining seven men in southwest Sydney on Thursday after receiving a tip that a \"violent act was possibly being planned\", New South Wales Police said in a statement.Police said they did not identify \"any connection\" to their investigation into Sunday's attack in Bondi. Two cars were \"intercepted\" at George Street, police said. In videos shared by local media sites, armed officers appeared to detain people on the street just hours after Albanese made his speech.Antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal, who also spoke at the press conference, said the country was \"at a very important moment not only for our community, but for fighting antisemitism around the world.\" Albanese said his government would be \"fully supporting and adopting\" the  recommendations Segal put forward in July in a report.Her report was criticised by some upon its release in July due to its implications for free speech, including plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. There were concerns for instance, that the funding could be used to silence pro-Palestinian protests.The Jewish Council of Australia said it supported Albanese's commitment to act, including his focus on gun reform and online hate.But, it said it was \"concerned that elements of today's announcement resemble long-standing proposals from the pro-Israel lobby which have nothing to do with addressing violent extremism.\"\"If education initiatives like university scorecards become a form of ideological policing - particularly where they are used to limit legitimate criticism of Israel - they will only make Jews less safe, and do the opposite of combating antisemitism,\" Jewish Council of Australia executive officer Dr Max Kaiser said.Meanwhile, Albanese acknowledged accusations from the Jewish community that his government had not done enough to prevent antisemitism since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and said more could have been done. \"I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,\" he said. \"But what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation. Because what people are looking for at this time isn't more division.\"Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government was \"shifting the threshold\" on hate speech.\"There have been individuals who have managed to exploit a nation that had different principles of freedom of speech and have gone right to the limits of language that is clearly dehumanising, unacceptable, having no place in Australia, but have not quite crossed the threshold to violence,\" he said.Daniel Aghion, the President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak body representing Australian Jews, said he would \"need to see the details before making an assessment as to whether the measures are likely to live up to their billing.\"\"We warned of the risk of not dealing with antisemitism in this country promptly and effectively after 7 October. It is an absolute tragedy that it has taken a massacre of Jewish and other Australians for that step to be taken.\"",

    "body": "An HR executive caught on the big screen at a Coldplay concert embracing her boss has described how \"the harassment has never ended\" following the viral moment.Kristin Cabot has spoken publicly for the first time about the video in which she was seen hugging Andy Byron, then-CEO of tech company Astronomer, at the show in July, before they abruptly ducked and hid from the camera.Ms Cabot, 53, who was the company's chief people officer, stepped down following Mr Byron's resignation after the firm announced he would be placed on leave and investigated.Speaking to the Times, Ms Cabot said she has been looking for another job but been told she is \"unemployable\".The video, which showed the pair swaying to music at the concert in Boston, Massachusetts, before trying to hide, quickly went viral, after Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin said to the crowd: \"Either they're having an affair, or they're just very shy.\"It was watched millions of times, shared widely across platforms, and the pair became the butt of many jokes. Within a few days, the internet had moved on, but for Ms Cabot, her ordeal had only just begun. \"I became a meme, I was the most maligned HR manager in HR history,\" Ms Cabot told The Times.Ms Cabot was separated from her husband, who was also at the concert.In a separate interview with the New York Times, she explained she was not in a sexual relationship with Mr Byron and the pair had never kissed before that night - although she admits to having had a \"crush\" on her boss.\"I made a bad decision and had a couple of High Noons and danced and acted inappropriately with my boss,\" she said, adding she \"took accountability and I gave up my career for that\".As to why she chose to speak out now, Ms Cabot told the Times \"...it's not over for me, and it's not over for my kids. The harassment never ended\".Her two children are too embarrassed to be picked up from school by their mother, she said, or to go to sports games.\"They're mad at me. And they can be mad at me for the rest of their lives - I have to take that.\"Ms Cabot wondered whether Mr Byron had received the same level of abuse throughout the ordeal, the Times reported.\"I think as a woman, as women always do, I took the bulk of the abuse. People would say things like I was a 'gold-digger' or I 'slept my way to the top', which just couldn't be further from reality,\" she said.\"I worked so hard to dispel that all my life and here I was being accused of it.\"At the peak of the scandal, her appearance, body, face and clothes were scrutinised and picked apart, with many high-profile celebrities including Whoopi Golderg piling on. Gwyneth Paltrow, who was once married to Chris Martin, even took part in a tongue-in-cheek promotional video for Astronomer.Ms Cabot told the New York Times she received threatening messages after the incident, including from a person who said they knew where she shopped and wrote: \"I'm coming for you\".She said \"my kids were afraid that I was going to die and they were going to die\", and that her family began to dread public spaces and social events.Women were the cruellest critics, she told the New York Times, with all of the in-person bullying, plus most of the phone calls and messages from women.Her private details were put online (known as doxxing) and for weeks she was bombarded with up to 600 calls a day, the New York Times reported. The paparazzi outside her house was like a \"parade\" and there were 50 or 60 death threats, she said.Things are starting to improve, though. Ms Cabot has found therapists for her children and she has started leaving the house to play tennis, she said.She said that while she and Mr Byron kept in touch for a short while, exchanging \"crisis management advice\", they decided \"speaking with each other was going to make it too hard for everyone to move on and heal,\" and have not spoken since.For his part, Mr Byron has not spoken publicly.A fake statement purporting to be from him, complete with Coldplay lyrics, went viral after the concert and Astronomer had to release its own to say that he had not made any comment.\"Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding,\" the statement read. \"Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability.\"It later said: \"Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted.\"The BBC has tried to contact Andy Byron, via his former employer Astronomer, for comment.",

    "body": "Naveed Akram, the surviving suspect in Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act, the New South Wales police say.Akram, 24, was critically injured during the incident. His father Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in an exchange of fire with police at the scene.Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in the attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. It was the country's deadliest shooting since 1996.Among the charges against Akram are 40 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, as well as one charge of causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.Akram had his first hearing from his hospital bedside, the local New South Wales court said. The case has been adjourned until April 2026, the court added. Earlier on Wednesday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said they were waiting for medication to wear off before formally questioning Akram.\"For his fairness, we need him to understand what is exactly happening,\" Lanyon said.As of Wednesday evening local time, 17 people are still being treated in hospitals across Sydney. One is in critical condition, with four others described as critical but stable.Police have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been \"motivated by Islamic State\" group ideology.On Tuesday, it emerged that the father and son had travelled to the Philippines in November.The Philippine immigration bureau told the BBC that they were in the country from 1 November to 28 November. Their final destination was the southern city of Davao, an immigration spokesperson said.Naveed Akram travelled to the Philippines using an Australian passport, while his father Sajid used an Indian passport, border authorities in Manila told the BBC.Sajid Akram was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, but had \"limited contact\" with his family there, a police official from the Indian state of Telangana said.Among those killed in the attack were two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl, named by her family as Matilda.Boris and Sofia Gurman, a couple filmed wrestling with one of the gunmen during the early stages of the attack, were also among the victims.Another 27 people were taken to hospital with injuries, including two police officers. One of the officers, named as 22-year-old Jack Hibbert, has lost vision in one eye and faces a \"long and challenging recovery\", his family said in a statement.Earlier in the day, thousands gathered to mourn British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, at the first funeral to be held for victims of the shooting.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was not present. Asked on ABC NewsRadio about his absence, he said: \"I would attend anything that I'm invited to. These are funerals that are taking place to farewell people's loved ones.\"The Jewish community has criticised Albanese for not taking enough action on antisemitism - he defended himself against those accusations, telling ABC NewsRadio he had taken a series of measures including appointing the country's first antisemitism envoy, toughening hate speech laws and increasing funding for social cohesion projects and Jewish institutions.Speaking at Rabbi Schlanger's funeral, Rabbi Levi Wolff described his death as an \"unspeakable loss\" for the community.\"Eli was ripped away from us, doing what he loved best,\" he said.\"Spreading love and joy and caring for his people with endless self-sacrifice in his life and in his death, he towered above as one of the highest and holiest souls.\"Rabbi Schlanger had helped organise Sunday's Hanukkah event.Funerals for the other victims are expected to happen over the coming days, including for the youngest victim, Matilda, on Thursday.",

    "body": "21 hours agoNardine Saad,Los Angeles andRegan Morris,Los AngelesWatch: \"Quite an occasion\" - BBC reports from Nick Reiner’s first court appearanceChildren of slain Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Reiner are speaking out for the first time after their deaths and the arrest of their brother, Nick. Jake and Romy Reiner said in a statement on Wednesday that they are experiencing \"unimaginable pain\" after the \"horrific and devastating loss\". They did not directly address the allegations against their brother.  Nick Reiner, 32, appeared in court for the first time on Wednesday and waived his right to enter a plea to two charges of first-degree murder. The couple were found dead on Sunday in their Los Angeles home. The county's medical examiner on Wednesday said they died in a homicide by multiple sharp force injuries.Nick Reiner was taken into custody on Sunday and charged with murder on Tuesday.\"The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience,\" Romy and Jake Reiner said in a statement provided to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner. \"They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends.\"\"We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life,\" they added. The siblings also asked for privacy \"and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave\".Family representatives did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.ReutersAt the hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, prosecutors and Mr Reiner's defence team agreed to delay his arraignment until 7 January, when he will once again have the opportunity to enter a plea.As he appeared in court, Mr Reiner said only \"yes, your honour\" when asked by Judge Theresa McGonigle if he understood that he has the right to a speedy trial.The judge earlier ordered the assembled media - who gathered outside the courthouse hours prior to the hearing - not to film the defendant, who was wearing a jail suicide-prevention smock.Media inside the courtroom could not see Mr Reiner during the brief hearing because he was sitting in a corner out of sight, but glimpses afterward revealed his face was blank, and his arms bare and shackled. He was initially slated to make a court appearance on Tuesday but had not been medically cleared to do so, his lawyer and prosecutors said.His lawyer, Alan Jackson, told reporters outside court that there were \"complex and serious issues\" in the case that needed to be worked through in the coming weeks.\"We ask that during this process, you allow the system to move forward in the way that it was designed to move forward,\" Mr Jackson told reporters.\"Not with a rush to judgement, not with jumping to conclusions, but with restraint and with dignity, and with the respect that this system and this process deserves, and that the family deserves,\" he said.The delay in Mr Reiner entering a plea could be designed to allow time for a psychiatric evaluation, one criminal defence lawyer told the BBC after the hearing.\"The psychiatric evaluation is generally done before arraignment to see if he is even fit to stand trial,\" Seth Zuckerman said.Getty ImagesNick Reiner (right) is accused of killing his parentsUntil the next hearing on 7 January, Mr Reiner will remain in custody at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles.If he pleads not guilty, he could be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors have said no decision has been made yet about whether the death penalty will be pursued.Rob Reiner directed a handful of iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.Michele Singer Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.\"This case is heartbreaking and deeply personal, not only for the Reiner family and their loved ones, but for the entire city,\" LA Police Department chief Jim McDonnell said.With additional reporting from Sakshi VenkatramanWatch: Moment Nick Reiner is arrested after being seen in convenience store",

    "body": "Heavy rains over the past week have compounded the already dire living conditions of the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, UN agencies say.Unicef spokesman Jonathan Crickx told the BBC that the weather overnight had been \"horrendous\", with the rain so intense that he had seen up to 15cm (6in) of water on the ground near his office.He said he was extremely concerned that children living in tents and makeshift shelters in wet clothing would succumb to hypothermia and other illnesses.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said one baby has died from hypothermia and at least 11 other people have died in building collapses caused by the severe weather.UN agencies have stepped up deliveries of tents, blankets and clothes since the Gaza ceasefire began nine weeks ago, but they have said there is still not enough aid getting in.The UN and its partners estimate that almost 55,000 families have so far been affected by the rains, with their belongings and shelters damaged or destroyed.More than 40 designated emergency shelters were severely flooded following downpours on Monday and Tuesday, forcing many people to relocate again.\"Last night was really horrendous for the families. The heavy rains were so intense that we could see from our office and guest house 10cm, 15cm (4-6in) of water at some point. And the winds were so strong,\" Jonathan Crickx, chief of communications for Unicef State of Palestine, told the BBC's Today programme on Wednesday.\"When I drove this morning, I could see that many, many people were trying with buckets to remove some of the water.\"He noted that most of the estimated one million people living in tents and makeshift shelters had been displaced many times during the two years of war between Israel and Hamas, and that they had no or very few changes of clothes.\"When I was seeing [children] this morning, their clothes were damp. I could see parents trying to dry some of the blankets they had. But it has been raining almost all of the time in the past four or five days, so it is extremely difficult to keep the children dry,\" he said.\"With temperatures about 7C, 8C (45-46F) at night, we are extremely concerned about children getting sick or even worse, dying from hypothermia.\"Many tents were also at risk of being blown away or destroyed by the strong winds accompanying the rain because they were only made from a piece of tarpaulin or plastic sheeting nailed to a fragile wooden structure, he added.Mr Crickx said Unicef had been able to bring in more aid during the ceasefire to help children cope with the harsh winter conditions, including 250,000 winter clothing kits, 600,000 blankets and 7,000 tents, but that it was not enough.\"We are working relentlessly to bring in that aid and to distribute it, but the scale of the needs is so immense that we still have thousands of people and children who are really suffering every night,\" he warned.Gaza's health ministry said a two-week old boy named Mohammed Abu al-Khair had died of hypothermia on Monday, two days after he had been admitted to hospital and placed in intensive care. Another 11 people had so far died after the war-damaged buildings where they were sheltering collapsed, it added.A spokesman for the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, Mahmoud Bassal, put the death toll higher. He said in a video that a total of 17 people, including four children, had died because of building collapses and the cold.He added that 17 residential buildings had collapsed completely because of the wind and rain and that another 90 buildings had collapsed partially.On Tuesday, video footage showed first responders from the Civil Defence recovering the body of a man from the rubble of a building in Shati refugee camp, north-west of Gaza City. Its roof had collapsed suddenly, according to eyewitnesses.\"We call on the world to solve our problems and rebuild the territory so that people can have homes instead of being displaced and living in the streets,\" said Ahmed al-Hosari, a relative of the man, told AFP news agency.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the collapse of damaged buildings due to the severe weather conditions was \"deeply concerning\".It stressed the need for \"increased and sustained humanitarian assistance to respond to urgent and long-term needs, including food, shelter and equipment for the repair of critical infrastructure\".Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's border crossings, has dismissed claims of deliberate aid restrictions as \"inconsistent with facts on the ground, and the ongoing co-ordination taking place daily\".It says that between 600 and 800 lorries carrying humanitarian supplies enter Gaza daily, and that almost 310,000 tents and tarpaulins have been delivered since the start of the ceasefire, along with more than 1,800 lorry loads of warm blankets and clothing.The UN says a total of 67,800 tents, 372,500 tarpaulins and 318,100 bedding items have been collected from crossings over the same period.The second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas includes plans for the reconstruction of Gaza, along with post-war governance, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.Last week, Israel's prime minister said the second phase was close, with only the body of one dead Israeli hostage in Gaza still to be returned by Hamas as part of the first phase.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 70,600 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",

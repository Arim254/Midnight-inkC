    "body": "11 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlinGetty ImagesA vast stockpile of potatoes is being given away for free by a farm in the German state of Saxony, after a bumper harvest .Thousands of tasty tubers have been rolling into the country's capital, Berlin, since mid-January, with residents risking icy streets to bag their share.Dubbed \"the great potato rescue\" it is part of a plan to stop about 4 million kg (8.8 million lb) of surplus spuds from going to ruin. Food banks, schools and churches are among the beneficiaries, according to organisers.Germany is the European Union's potato-producing capital, and last year's harvest has left the market saturated.Ultimately it is about \"putting the potato in the spotlight as a valuable food,\" said Berliner Morgenpost editor, Peter Schink who helped spearhead the plan.The newspaper teamed up with eco-friendly search engine firm, Ecosia, to co-ordinate and fund the distribution of the spuds.Not wishing to discard its \"magnificent tubers\" back into the fields, Osterland Agrar says it's set to have bussed around 500,000kg to Berlin, and other parts of Germany and Ukraine.\"We can store them until the middle of this year,\" said Hans-Joachim von Massow, Managing Director of Osterland Agrar, the agricultural firm that ended up with all the potatoes.But not everyone is celebrating.\"Food is and will remain valuable, even if thoughtless do-gooders throw around free potatoes at schools and churches,\" said Timo Scheib from the Brandenburg Farmers' Association.The BBC skidded optimistically along to a pickup spot at the city's de-commissioned airfield, Tempelhofer Feld, but there were no veggie sacks to be seen.And when we sheepishly asked a local resident about whether she'd noticed any \"frei Kartoffeln\" in the area she seemed slightly mystified, if not a little concerned for me.Nevertheless, as potatoes took off out of Saxony, so has the story, receiving media coverage in Germany and beyond.However we are told by Schink that the influx is, as things stand, set to wind down in Berlin as the funding is drying up.One more truckload can be expected once the weather is warm enough.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDan JohnsonBBC correspondent, JerusalemReutersMost of Gaza has been reduced to rubble as a result of the warIsraeli media report that a senior security source has said the military accepts that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war in Gaza.Israel has previously cast doubt on figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.But their figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media.The war began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says at least 492 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.Israel has always disputed the Hamas figures and said before last year's ceasefire it had killed 1,600 fighters since 7 October 2023 and another 22,000 combatants in the war. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously said it believed two or three civilians had been killed for every dead militant. Now a senior military source has indicated to Israeli journalists, including those from Haaretz and the Times of Israel, that the total number given by the Hamas health ministry is largely accurate, even though they have not been able to break down how many were combatants and how many died as a direct result of the fighting.Following the latest Israeli media reports, a military official said the details published did not reflect official IDF data. \"Any publication or report on this matter will be released through official and orderly channels,\" the IDF official said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKayla EpsteinNew York CityGetty ImagesLuigi Mangione in court in December 2025A man accused of impersonating a federal agent in a bid to allegedly free Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down the CEO of United Healthcare in 2024, has been arrested. Mark Anderson, 36, is accused of going to the New York jail where Mangione is being housed and allegedly posing as an FBI agent, a criminal complaint states. He allegedly said he had paperwork that had been \"signed by a judge\" to free the accused killer.Though the complaint does not name Mangione, a law enforcement source told the BBC that Anderson allegedly sought to free him. He appeared before a judge on Thursday but has not entered a plea. The BBC has contacted an attorney said to be representing him. Anderson approached the intake area of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday and is accused of telling officers that he was an FBI agent, the criminal complaint states. He said he had paperwork \"signed by a judge\" to authorise the release of an inmate.When officers asked him for credentials, Anderson provided a Minnesota driver's license, claimed be in possession of weapons, and \"displayed and threw\" what authorities described as \"numerous documents\" at jail staff, according to the complaint. Bureau of Prisons officials then detained Anderson and searched his bag, where they found a large \"barbeque type fork\" with two prongs and a tool that resembles a pizza cutter.The suspect had travelled to New York City for a job opportunity from Mankato, Minnesota, and had been working at a local pizzeria, according to the law enforcement source.Department of JusticeAuthorities searched Anderson's bag after he claimed to have weapons and found these utensils, according to the criminal complaintAnderson is facing a charge of impersonating an officer. Mangione has been held at the Brooklyn jail since 2024. He was arrested in a McDonalds in Pennsylvania after a multi-state manhunt and then extradited to New York. He faces both state and federal charges in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and has pleaded not guilty. Since his arrest, Mangione has attracted a legion of supporters both online and at his court appearances. The killing also launched a debate in the US over healthcare costs.Jury selection for Mangione's highly anticipated federal trial is currently scheduled for September.",

    "body": "8 hours agoBen HattonBBC NewsPA MediaThe site of a drone attack in Kyiv earlier in January US President Donald Trump says Russia's Vladimir Putin has agreed not to attack Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and other cities and towns for a week due to \"extraordinary cold\" weather. Russia has not confirmed any such agreement, but Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed Trump's announcement and said he expected Russia to keep its promise.Trump did not specify when the pause would begin, but temperatures in the Ukrainian capital are due to plummet from Thursday night and reach -24C (-11F) in the next few days. Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the bitter winter, as it has during cold periods since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Speaking at a televised cabinet meeting in Washington DC, the US president said: \"I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that.\"\"It was very nice. A lot of people said, 'Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he [Putin] did it,\" Trump added.The Ukrainians, he said, \"almost they didn't believe it, but they were very happy about it because they are struggling badly\". Later on Thursday, in a post on social media, Zelensky said Trump had made an \"important statement\" about \"the possibility of providing security for Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this extreme winter period\". \"Our teams discussed this in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We expect the agreements to be implemented,\" he said. The BBC understands that Ukraine has agreed to mirror Moscow's actions - pausing its own attacks on Russian oil refineries in response.Last week, Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met in the UAE for the first trilateral talks since the war began.All sides described the talks as constructive, but there has been no announcement that Russia had agreed to pause its attacks for the duration of the extreme cold currently gripping the region.Instead, attacks have continued, crippling the power supply to major Ukrainian cities, leaving millions without heating or electricity.Electrical companies carry out round-the-clock repairs, but their work can be quickly undone by Russian air attacks. Even when power is restored, the supply only lasts a few hours - enough to charge appliances but not to substantially warm up homes.",

    "body": "15 hours agoJessica RawnsleyEPAThe warring countries agreed to the exchange during talks in Istanbul last yearThe bodies of 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been returned by Russia, Kyiv has said, in the latest exchange between the warring countries. Russia received 38 bodies in return, Moscow's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said.Medinsky posted a photo on Telegram apparently showing the exchange, with individuals dressed in biohazard suits standing next to a line of white refrigerated trucks used to transport bodies.Kyiv and Moscow have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the almost four-year conflict. The latest exchange took place under an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in 2025.Under that deal, Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of 12,000 soldiers, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.Vladimir Medinsky/TelegramMoscow's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky confirmed the exchange on Telegram The last swap took place in November last year when Russia returned 1,000 bodies to Ukraine and received 30 in return.There has not been an exchange of prisoners of war since October 2025, with both sides accusing the other of stalling.As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, efforts at brokering a peace deal between the two countries continue.The negotiations were described by all sides as constructive, but key territorial issues remain unresolved, including Russia's demand that Ukraine give up the 25% of the Donetsk region still under its control.Despite the ongoing negotiations, both sides continue to exchange drone attacks. At least five people were killed in Ukraine's Kharkiv region on Tuesday after a Russian drone struck a passenger train. Russia has intensified its strikes on key infrastructure targets in recent months, leaving many people in Ukraine to face freezing temperatures without heating or power.More on this story",

    "body": "13 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondent, ParisAFP via Getty ImagesThe proposed bill was approved in the French National Assembly on WednesdayFrance is to enshrine in law the end of so-called \"conjugal rights\" – the notion that marriage means a duty to have sex.A bill approved on Wednesday in the National Assembly adds a clause to the country's civil code to make clear that \"community of living\" does not create an \"obligation for sexual relations\".The proposed law also makes it impossible to use lack of sexual relations as an argument in fault-based divorce.Though unlikely to have a major impact in the courts, supporters hope the law will help deter marital rape.\"By allowing such a right or duty to persist, we are collectively giving our approval to a system of domination and predation by husband on wife,\" said the bill's sponsor, Green MP Marie-Charlotte Garin.\"Marriage cannot be a bubble in which consent to sex is regarded as definitive and for life.\"The law will erase an ambiguity that has persisted despite there being no explicit mention of \"conjugal duty\" in any legal text.Currently, the French civil code defines the duties of marriage as \"respect, fidelity, support and assistance,\" and it says that couples commit themselves to a \"community of living\".Nowhere in the texts is there any mention of \"conjugal\" - ie sexual - rights. The origins of that notion lie in medieval church law.However judges in modern divorce suits have, from time to time, given a broad interpretation to the concept of \"community of living\" to include sexual relations.In a famous case in 2019 a woman was found to have withheld sex from her husband for several years, and he was then granted a \"fault-based\" divorce implying guilt on her part.But the woman then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which last year condemned France for allowing refusal of sex to be grounds for a fault-based divorce.This was hailed as an important advance by feminist campaigners.The ECHR's decision has made it, in practice, impossible for any French divorce judge to make a similar ruling - which is why the new law is mainly intended as a clarification, with the change unlikely to have a major impact on the courts.For campaigners, the notion that wives have a \"duty\" to agree to sex with their husbands is one that persists in parts of society and needs to be confronted.The Mazan trial of 2024 – where a drugged and unconscious Gisèle Pelicot was repeatedly raped by men invited by her husband - is seen as emblematic. Several defendants said they assumed her consent because of what her husband had told them.In France, as in most other countries, marital rape is now enshrined in law, where prior to 1990 men could argue that marriage implied consent.Since November last year the legal definition of rape in France has also been expanded to include the notion of non-consent.Previously, rape was defined as a sexual act carried out with \"violence, constraint, threat or surprise\". Now it is any act where there is no \"informed,  specific, anterior and revocable\" consent. Silence or an absence of reaction do not imply consent, the law says.If you have been affected by any issues raised in this article, please visit BBC Action Line",

    "body": "3 days agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerifying Iran footage as internet blackout continuesVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

One Cape Town independent cinema contacted by the BBC said that it was called by Filmfinity and told not to list it.Relations between the US and South Africa have seriously deteriorated over the past year.Amazon has reportedly paid $35m (£25m) to market the film which follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to her husband's second inauguration on 20 January last year.It is also believed that Amazon paid around $40m for the rights to the film.\"Based on recent developments, we've taken the decision to not go ahead with a theatrical release in territory,\" Filmfinity's Thobashan Govindarajulu is quoted as saying by the New York Times.He told News24 that the decision had been taken \"given the current climate\".The executive did not elaborate on what was he meant by \"recent developments\" or \"current climate\".Attempts by the BBC to get comment from Filmfinity, which describes itself as the leading film distributor in southern Africa, have so far been unsuccessful. But contacting the independent Labia cinema in Cape Town, the BBC was told that it was called by Filmfinity who said that the film would not be playing.Show times for Melania are not listed on the websites of South Africa's two main cinema chains, Ster Kinekor and Nu Metro.Since Donald Trump came to power a year ago, US relations with South Africa have slumped. The president has also imposed high tariffs on South African goods and cut aid programmes.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "2 hours agoBasillioh RukangaandChris EwokorAFP via Getty ImagesThe blasts happened near Niamey's airport (file photo)Suspected jihadists have launched an attack on the international airport outside Niger's capital Niamey.Niger's defence ministry said four military personnel were injured and 20 attackers were killed, with state television saying that a French national was among them.There were 11 arrests over the incident at Diori Hamani International Airport overnight from Wednesday to Thursday, in which sustained heavy gunfire and loud explosions were heard nearby.Eyewitness accounts and videos showed air defence systems apparently engaging unidentified projectiles in the early hours of Thursday but services at the airport returned to normal during the day.The head of Niger's junta on Thursday thanked Russia for its help in foiling the attack on the airport, and accused the presidents of France and Benin of backing those responsible. The military junta that came to power in a July 2023 coup has frosty relations with France and Benin, and regularly accuses them of trying to destabilise Niger, which both countries deny. \"We commend all the defence and security forces... as well as Russian partners who defended their security sector with professionalism,\" General Abdourahamane Tiani said on state radio.\"We remind the sponsors of these mercenaries, notably Emmanuel Macron, Patrice Talon and Alassane Ouattara: we've heard them bark quite enough; now they should get ready to listen to us.\"Niger's Defence Minister, Salifou Modi, said in a statement on public television that the mercenaries attacked an air base in the capital for \"about 30 minutes\" before an \"air and ground response\".The channel broadcast footage of Tiani visiting the military base, showing the bodies of the attackers and said there was \"a Frenchman\" among them.The airport houses an air force base and is about 10km (six miles) from the presidential place.One local resident told the BBC that shots had been fired from outside the airport, targeting planes.Others described their fear as they heard the gunshots and explosions.“We didn't sleep last night,\" said one resident. \"Our room and the whole house was shaking from the gunshots and explosions,” she said.\"Yesterday was the first time I have ever heard gunfire,\" another woman said. \"We were so scared.\"Several unconfirmed reports said unknown assailants had thrown explosive devices towards the airport area before exchanging fire with security forces.According to the FlightRadar24 website, several flights bound for Niamey were diverted.AFP reports there was a heavy security deployment around the airport on Thursday morning.Niger, like its neighbours Burkina Faso and Mali, has been fighting jihadists who have carried out deadly attacks across the region.The country is a major producer of uranium.A huge uranium shipment destined for export has been stuck at the airport amid unresolved legal and diplomatic complications with France after the military government nationalised the country's uranium mines.More about Niger from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "13 hours agoLucy ManningSpecial correspondentWatch: Sasha Troufanov told the BBC the return of Ran Gvlili's body was a 'big relief'A former Israeli hostage who was held for nearly 500 days in Gaza says the return of the body of the final hostage this week means all the released captives can \"now breathe and start our lives again\".Thirty-year-old Sasha Troufanov, an Amazon electronics engineer, was taken hostage on 7 October 2023 by Palestinian Islamic Jihad gunmen. His fiancée Sapir Cohen, mother and grandmother were also kidnapped and taken to Gaza. The women were released after more than 50 days as hostages. He was freed a year ago, after 498 days in captivity.In his first international interview, Troufanov, on a visit to London, told BBC News that with the return on Monday of Ran Gvili's body meaning all the hostages were back \"it felt wonderful. We waited so long for this to happen. \"I was carrying this burden ever since I came back. It was like a weight on my shoulders that kept me from coming back to my life. Although we were released, we didn't really come out of Gaza because our friends and brothers were still there.\"But the moment was bittersweet for him as Monday was also the birthday of his father Vitaly. Troufanov only discovered his father had been murdered on 7 October on the day he was released in February 2025 and realised his dad wasn't there to meet him.Troufanov and Cohen had been visiting his family on Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza when Palestinian gunmen stormed their homes. Cohen rolled herself up in blanket and hid under the bed but they were both captured. Troufanov was punched and also stabbed in the shoulder. \"I saw the terrorist with so much anger and hate in his face, holding his knife trying to stab me even more.\"As the attackers tried to take Troufanov off the kibbutz he managed to momentarily escape but when he gave up running they still shot him twice in each leg. \"I just felt the rush of pain going through my brain and I fell to the ground then one of the terrorists hit me with the rifle from the back of my head and split it open.\"When he arrived to Gaza, he says he was then beaten by civilians and thought \"this is the moment you're going to die\".While in Gaza, Troufanov received almost no medical treatment. He was taken once to a family home and once to a hospital where his broken leg was wrapped first with a wooden broom and then with part of a metal grill.Unlike many other hostages, he was held almost entirely in isolation. For only two  of the 498 days in captivity did Troufanov see another hostage.ReutersTroufanov was released in February 2025 after 498 days in captivityAt the start he was held above ground, for more than six weeks locked in a cage and given barely enough food to survive. Here, he says he experienced sexual harassment where one guard repeatedly tried to encourage him to do a sexual act on himself. He also says a hidden camera filmed him when he was allowed a shower once a week. \"I noticed it and I took the shower trying to avoid my private parts towards this angle, but I had to do it because I needed to shower.\"Taken underground to the tunnels, Troufanov says he was left for months alone, his captors only bringing food then leaving him in a silent, cramped, humid space so dark he couldn't see his hand in front of his face.\"I remember feeling that I am buried underneath the ground while I am still alive. I was losing it. I was having a hard time to find hope in this place. Many times I lost hope completely. I said to myself: 'This is the last place you will see alive.'\"It is the first time since 2014 that there are no Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Two hundred and fifty-one people were taken captive during the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025, at least 492 Palestinians have been killed, the health ministry says, as well as four Israeli soldiers.Now all the hostages, those alive and those who were killed, have returned to Israel the second phase of US President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza can commence. The key Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is set to open on an ongoing basis for the first time since May 2024, as required under the plan.It also envisages the full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups; a technocratic Palestinian government; and the reconstruction of Gaza.Sasha Troufanov believes that these measures aren't enough to ensure an attack like the one on 7 October won't happen again. \"Rebuilding Gaza, after what happened in the war, is understandable. But first of all we need to make sure that the people of Gaza will stop trying to hurt Israel. The terrorists were telling me: 'We will do this again and again.'\"Rebuilding Gaza and opening the Rafah crossing is in vain as it will never solve the real problem. We need to find a way to make this hatred and encouragement of terrorist activity stop.\"The former hostage now has to rehabilitate mentally and physically. He is currently on crutches after surgery on his leg but hopes to dance at his wedding to Sapir Cohen in a few weeks. \"It's a victory: overcoming hate and fear and saying to ourselves: 'We will build life together and we will continue.'\"",

    "body": "Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family6 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentCCTVDozens of members of the Ming family were sentenced in SeptemberNo-one should be surprised that China has swiftly executed the 11 members of a organised crime family from north-eastern Myanmar who were sentenced to death in  September.China executes more people than anywhere else in the world, according to  human rights groups – the exact figure is a state secret. Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious.The Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar's impoverished Shan state, since 2009.They rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s.The four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud.Chinese Ministry of Public SecurityMing Zhenzhen and Ming Guoping in the custody of Chinese policeThey remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for \"extraordinary contributions to state development\".His Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP.The scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine.Tens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate \"pig-butchering\" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media.The most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action.With China's apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely.They detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said.Getty ImagesShe Zhijiang, who is accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, was extradited to China last yearDuring interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength.These details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded.The four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet.China has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar's war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial.The scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down.And it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.",

    "body": "3 hours agoIan AikmanandBen HattonEPAThe European Union has added Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to its terrorist list in response to Tehran's deadly crackdown on protesters in recent weeks.\"Repression cannot go unanswered,\" the bloc's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said, adding the move would put the IRGC - a major military, economic and political force in Iran - on the same level as jihadists like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group.Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the EU decision was a \"stunt\" and a \"major strategic mistake\".Human rights groups estimate thousands of protesters were killed by security forces, including the IRGC, during weeks of unrest in December and January.Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot described it as \"the most violent repression in Iran's modern history\" and said there could be \"no impunity for the crimes committed\".France had previously been seen as hesitant to add the IRGC to the EU's terror list over fears this could put an end to all diplomatic ties with Iran. But it changed course on Wednesday, coming out strongly behind a push to blacklist the group, which was led by Italy.\"Any regime that kills thousands of its own people is working toward its own demise,\" Kallas said in a brief statement on social media.She said she expected diplomatic channels to remain open with Iran, even after adding the IRGC to its list of groups involved in acts of terrorism.The EU also placed new sanctions on six entities and 15 individuals in Iran, including Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni, Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi Azad and Iman Afshari, a presiding judge.\"They were all involved in the violent repression of peaceful protests and the arbitrary arrest of political activists and human rights defenders,\" the bloc said in a statement.Organisations on the EU's terrorist list are subject to sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, with the aim of removing their support networks.Iran's most powerful armed force, the IRGC was set up shortly after the 1979 revolution to defend the country's Islamic system. It is estimated to have about 190,000 active personnel, with capabilities across land, air and sea, as well as overseeing Iran's strategic weapons.It exerts influence overseas by providing money, weapons, technology and advice to allied governments and armed groups, and also controls the paramilitary Basij Resistance Force inside Iran, which has hundreds of thousands of members and has been used to suppress dissent.Australia, Canada and the US have already classified the IRGC as a terror group but it has not been proscribed in the UK.On Wednesday, UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy condemned Iran's \"brutal oppression of peaceful protesters\" but said it was long-standing government policy \"not to comment on whether a specific organisation is being considered for proscription\".The EU's announcement comes after US President Donald Trump said earlier this week that a \"massive Armada\" was moving quickly towards Iran \"with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose\".Handout via ReutersTrump said the fleet was headed by the USS Abraham Lincoln (file image)On Thursday, the US president said he hoped to avoid military action against Iran by having further talks on a possible nuclear deal.\"I built [up] the military in my first term, and now we have a group headed out to a place called Iran, and hopefully we won't have to use it,\" Trump told reporters at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania.Asked if he would have talks with Iran, Trump added: \"I have had and I am planning on it. Yes, we have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them.\"The Iranian foreign minister said the country's armed forces were ready \"with their fingers on the trigger\" to \"immediately and powerfully respond\" to any aggression.Araghchi said that rather than working to avert \"all-out war in our region\" Europe was \"busy fanning the flames\". Trump's latest warning follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the deadly crackdown on protesters earlier this month.An internet blackout imposed by Iran's authorities has made assessing the scale of the government's violence against protesters difficult.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said it had confirmed the killing of more than 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, while another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights, said the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities have said more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are unable to report from  inside Iran but videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.",

Funding for DHS will continue at its current amount for two weeks while both sides work out a new deal to fund the agency, CBS News said.US President Donald Trump endorsed the deal, and wrote in a post on social media: \"Hopefully, both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed Bipartisan \"YES\" Vote.\"The deal approves funding for the defence department, the health department, the treasury, the federal court system and other agencies until the end of the 2026 fiscal year on 30 September.In his post Trump added: \"Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security (including the very important Coast Guard, which we are expanding and rebuilding like never before).\"Democrats have been pushing to remove funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from a $1.2tn (£870bn) federal spending package since a federal agent killed a second US citizen in Minneapolis over the weekend.The DHS is a sprawling department encompassing multiple agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Coast Guard and Secret Service. Thousands of federal agents from ICE and CBP have been deployed to Minnesota as part of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown in the state. In Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on 7 January, and a Border Patrol officer shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti on 24 January. Both killings, and the ongoing immigration operation in the state, have sparked protests around the country. The second shooting led Democrats, and some Republicans, to push back on approving DHS funding. Among the changes to DHS Democrats are seeking are requirements that federal agents obtain warrants before making arrests and clearer rules governing how they identify themselves.On Wednesday, some Senate Democrats escalated their demands, expressly calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's removal, and for structural changes to both ICE and CBP. \"This madness,\" Schumer said, \"this terror must stop.\" Some Republicans pushed back, with John Cornyn of Texas saying that \"any changes must not come at the expense of shutting down the government\".What happens next?The spending bill had already passed in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate, it needed 60 votes to advance. There are only 53 Republican senators in the 100-member body, meaning that passing the bill required support from at least some Democratic members. Before the Senate reportedly agreed to remove the DHS bill from the package, a procedural vote to advance the budget failed in the Senate by 45-55 earlier on Thursday. All Democrats voted no, along with eight Republicans who said they were concerned about wasteful spending.Earlier this week, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said: \"I will vote no on any legislation that funds ICE until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue.\" Because the Senate removed the DHS bill from the six-bill package, the package will now need to be re-approved by the House, whose lawmakers are not due back until Monday. That means that funding for the departments included in the package could lapse over the weekend until the House convenes on Monday. The effects will be minimal though, as many government services do not operate over the weekend. Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWhat is a 'partial shutdown'? The entirety of the US federal government will not be hit by a shutdown if it does occur this weekend.It would only be partial because legislation has already been passed to fund dozens of agencies through the end of the 2026 fiscal year.Other branches included in the same spending bill as DHS, are the defence department, the health department, the treasury and the federal court system.The reported agreement between the Republicans and the Democrats would strip out the DHS from the funding bill, allowing Congress to pass the overall package of bills. DHS funding would be extended for two weeks, giving negotiators time to reach an agreement on immigration tactics, according to the reported deal. The DHS is a sprawling department encompassing multiple agencies, including ICE, CBP, the Coast Guard and Secret Service.During a partial shutdown employees that are \"essential\" to the functioning of impacted agencies continue to work, but will not be paid until funding is restored - unless the government finds other sources - as Trump did with military personnel last year. How long was the last shutdown? The most recent shutdown lasted 43 days between 1 October and 12 November last year, making it the longest in US history. Democrats had initially refused to support the funding bill, demanding that Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that were set to expire at the end of the year.Eventually, enough Democrats crossed the aisle to help pass the bill. That shutdown left around 1.4 million federal employees on unpaid leave or working without pay. Food aid was also left in limbo, and air travel was severely disrupted across the US. There have been a total of 16 government shutdowns since 1981, although some only lasted days. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoDaniel BushWashington correspondentUS border tsar: 'I came here to seek solutions'The Trump administration has suggested it is planning to \"draw down\" federal forces in Minnesota if there is cooperation from officials, after the fatal shootings of two US citizens in the state. At a press conference in Minneapolis, White House Border Tsar Tom Homan vowed to continue the immigration enforcement operation, but added he wants \"common sense cooperation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here\".\"We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter,\" Homan said. The deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have ignited local protests and public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers.It was not clear how many federal forces might leave the city, or when, raising new questions about how far the Trump administration will scale back its operation after the president said he was seeking to \"de-escalate\" in Minneapolis.Homan added: \"President Trump wants this fixed, and I'm going to fix it.\"The killings of Good and Pretti by agents carrying out Trump's immigration crackdown this month have provoked protests in Minneapolis, public outcry across the US and calls from lawmakers in both parties for some administration officials to be removed.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for a withdrawal of federal agents entirely from the state's capital region. The state has also asked a federal judge to stop \"Operation Metro Surge\", which involves approximately 3,000 immigration, border patrol and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers.The administration, meanwhile, has blasted local officials, saying they should work with federal officers and agents and also criticised Minneapolis for having a \"sanctuary city policy\" that bars city employees from enforcing immigration laws. Homan on Thursday said changes in the operation would depend on how much state and local officials cooperate with federal authorities, and added the administration disagreed with some of Frey and Walz's demands, but did not specify which ones.In the hours after Pretti was killed on Saturday, Walz spoke with the White House twice, and since then he and Frey, both Democrats, have had phone calls with Trump.In general, Homan provided few clues on what changes the administration would be willing to make. He said the federal operation in Minneapolis would be more \"targeted\", but did not offer more details. While he pledged to \"fix\" the crackdown in Minneapolis, Homan also defended the administration's immigration enforcement measures, saying that tightening border security and targeting undocumented immigrants for deportation had made the country safer.In Trump's first year back in office, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is part of DHS, carried out over 480,000 deportations, according to an agency document obtained by the BBC's US partner CBS News. The figure exceeds the previous high of 410,000 recorded in 2012, when former President Barack Obama was in office. The DHS is currently holding more than 75,000 people in detention, according to the document.Trump has sent federal agents, as well as the National Guard, to major US cities over the last year to make good on his campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration. They have been met by protests and legal challenges in Democrat-led cities like Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago.After frustration with the administration's handling of Good and Pretti's deaths appeared to reach a boiling point, both on the streets of Minneapolis and in the halls of Capitol Hill, Trump sent Homan to the city this week to take over the operation, sidelining Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, who had also led crackdowns in Chicago and other cities.Getty ImagesMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey speaks to reporters while visiting Capitol HIllIt's unclear whether Homan's remarks on Thursday will appease lawmakers in Washington, though.Several House and Senate Republicans have called for investigations into the Good and Pretti shootings.Senate Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown if a spending package includes new funding for DHS, as well.On Thursday, seven Senate Republicans joined Democrats in blocking a procedural vote on the spending bill, Senate leaders and the White House then worked on a deal that would remove DHS funding from the package, allowing the government to send money to other agencies and give both sides more time to negotiate a separate spending plan for DHS.\"Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security,\" Trump wrote on social mediaSenate Democrats want any bill to fund DHS to restrict the tactics that ICE uses in the field, specifically calling for them to stop wearing masks and carrying out searches and arrests without a judge's warrant. In a memo made public earlier this month, ICE authorised its agents to make warrantless searches.\"This is a moment of truth,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech Thursday. \"What ICE is doing, outside the law, is state-sanctioned thuggery and it must stop.\"Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Thursday that the White House was working with Democrats to avoid a shutdown.Speaking at a conference for mayors in Washington on Thursday, Frey continued calling for an end to the federal operation in his city. He also visited Capitol Hill.There were 3,000 to 4,000 federal forces in Minneapolis, Frey said, vastly outnumbering the city's 600 local police officers. Homan did not confirm how many federal forces were present when asked to provide an updated figure on Thursday.\"People have been indiscriminately pulled off the street,\" Frey said. \"American citizens have been yanked away from their homes after that, solely because they look like they are from Mexico or Ecuador or Somalia.\"He added: \"That's not how we operate in America.\"",

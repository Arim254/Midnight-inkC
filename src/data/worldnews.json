    "body": "1 hour agoJessica MurphyGetty ImagesDane revealed in April 2025 that he had been diagnosed with ALSEric Dane, the actor best known for his roles on Grey's Anatomy and Euphoria, has died less than a year after revealing he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was 53. Dane starred as family patriarch Cal Jacobs on hit HBO teen drama show Euphoria. Before that, he was perhaps best known as Dr Mark Sloan, or 'Dr McSteamy', on medical drama Grey's Anatomy.The California-born actor was diagnosed last year with ALS and spent the last few months raising awareness for the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).\"With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS,\" reads a statement from his family. He was married to fellow actress and model Rebecca Gayheart, with whom he had two children.The written statement said he spent his final days surrounded by friends and his devoted wife, and his two daughters, Billie and Georgia, \"who were the center of his world\". \"He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received,\" it said. Dane also played Jason Dean in fantasy drama series Charmed, and Captain Tom Chandler in action drama show The Last Ship, while appearing in films such as Marley & Me, Valentine's Day and Burlesque.Getty ImagesDane first appeared in the second series of Grey's Anatomy in 2006 before returning as a main cast memberALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare degenerative disease that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles. It affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, causing patients to slowly lose their ability to speak, eat, walk and breathe independently. \"Because, you know, my father was taken from me when I was young,\" he told the programme. \"And now, you know, there's a very good chance I'm going to be taken from my girls while they're very young\".His father died by suicide when Dane was seven years old. The actor was born in San Francisco in 1972 and made his television debut in the Wonder Years in 1993. Dane's Grey's Anatomy co-stars are leading tributes to the late actor.Kim Raver - who plays doctor Teddy Altman in the series - said: \"During filming he'd get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you.\" Kevin McKidd, who plays trauma surgeon Owen Hunt, posted \"rest in peace buddy\" on Instagram.Euphoria creator Sam Levinson told Variety: \"I'm heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend.\"\"Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift,\" he said.Correction 20 February 2026: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Kim Raver played Eric Dane's on-screen wife in Grey's Anatomy. Their characters had a short-lived romance but were not married.",

    "body": "21 hours agoInaya MohmoodNurPhoto/GettyPolice said the woman repeatedly asked ChatGPT \"Can you die from mixing sleeping pills with alcohol?\"A 21-year-old woman in South Korea has been charged with the murders of two men, after investigators discovered she had repeatedly asked ChatGPT about the dangers of mixing drugs with alcohol.Police in Seoul say that through analysis of her mobile phone they found that the suspect, identified only by her surname Kim, had asked ChatGPT \"What happens if you take sleeping pills with alcohol?\", \"How many do you need to take for it to be dangerous?\", and \"Could it kill someone?\"Kim previously told police that she did mix prescribed sedatives containing benzodiazepines into the drinks but did not know the men would die.However a police investigator said she was \"fully aware that consuming alcohol together with drugs could result in death.\"Kim was initially arrested on 11 February on the lesser charge of inflicting bodily injury resulting in death after two men died and another was left unconscious after going to a motel with her.According to police, Kim's first alleged attack took place on 28 January when she entered a motel in Suyu-dong, Gangbuk-gu, with a man in his 20s, she left the motel alone two hours later and the man was found dead inside the room the following day.Using the same method, she allegedly killed another man in his 20s on 9 February after the two checked into a different motel in Gangbuk-gu together.However, officials said that the suspects first attempt at murder via drug misuse had occurred in December last year when she gave a drink mixed with sedatives to her partner at the time, in a cafe parking lot in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, causing him to lose consciousness.According to police, after her first victim regained consciousness, Kim began to prepare her drinks with significantly higher doses of the drug.Police have said they plan to continue investigating whether there are additional victims beyond the three identified.More on this story",

    "body": "Mystery donor gives Japanese city $3.6m in gold bars to fix water system6 hours agoKoh EweOsaka City Waterworks BureauOsaka authorities received 21kg of gold bullion from a mystery donorA Japanese city has received a hefty donation to help fix its ageing water system: 21kg (46lb) in gold bars.The gold bars, worth an estimated 560 million yen ($3.6m; £2.7m), were given last November by a donor who wished to remain anonymous, Osaka Mayor Hideyuki Yokoyama told a press conference on Thursday.Home to nearly three million people, Osaka is a commercial hub located in the Japan's Kansai region and the country's third-largest city.But like many Japanese cities, Osaka's water and sewage pipes are ageing - a growing cause for safety concern.Osaka recorded more than 90 cases of water pipe leaks under its roads in the 2024 fiscal year, according to the city's waterworks bureau.\"Tackling ageing water pipes requires a huge investment. So I have nothing but appreciation,\" Yokoyama told reporters on Thursday, in response to a question about the huge gold donation.Yokoyama said the amount was \"staggering\" and he was \"lost for words\".The same mystery donor had previously given 500,000 yen in cash for municipal waterworks, he added.The city's waterworks bureau said in a statement on Thursday that it was grateful for the gold donation and would put it to good use - including tackling the deterioration of water pipes.More than 20% of Japan's water pipes have passed their legal service life of 40 years, according to local media.Sinkholes have also become increasingly common in Japanese cities, many of which have ageing sewage pipeline infrastructure.Last year, a massive sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture swallowed the cab of a truck, killing its driver. The sinkhole was believed to have been caused by a ruptured sewage pipe.That incident prompted Japanese authorities to step up efforts to replace corroded pipes across the country. But budget issues have stalled the progress of such pipe renewal works.",

    "body": "2 days agoJake Horton,Ghoncheh HabibiazadandSarah JalaliBBCCrowds of mourners appear to have been fired on by a security official at a cemetery in Iran.The incident happened in Abdanan, in west Iran, on Tuesday as people gathered to commemorate those killed during the government's brutal crackdown on protesters last month.Iranians usually hold commemoration ceremonies on the 40th day after someone dies. The events have been held in several cities across the country to mourn the thousands killed during the deadliest nights of protests on 8 and 9 January.Verified video also shows people shouting anti-government chants at events in Tehran, Mashhad and Abdanan on Tuesday as crowds gathered at cemeteries and in the streets for commemorations.State-organised ceremonies were broadcast on TV and attended by senior government and military officials where people were led by organisers to chant \"death to America\".BBC Verify and BBC Persian have verified footage of people chanting \"death to Khamenei\", referencing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An armoured vehicle is then seen driving past the crowd of mourners as an apparent security official opens fire. People are heard screaming and seen fleeing the area as two gunshots ring out.The person who appears to be in uniform is seen pointing the gun away from the camera when the first shot is fired, before pointing the gun towards the crowd when a second shot can be heard. A puff of smoke near the gun is visible after each shot.Another verified video from the cemetery shows smoke in the distance as people run away from the scene and several gunshots can be heard.State-run IRIB News claimed that the event was peaceful and reports of people injured or killed were not true.XA billboard in the background of one the videos shows a picture of Alireza Seydi, a teenager from Abdanan who was understood to have been killed during the protests in Tehran last month and appears to be one of those commemorated during the ceremony.Weeks of anti-government protests started in late December which began over the economy but rapidly escalated. It peaked on 8 and 9 January after Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, called for nationwide protests to take place. Thousands of people were killed in one of the deadliest government crackdowns in recent years. BBC Verify previously reported that it had spread to more than 68 towns and cities across the country.Khamenei last month acknowledged that thousands had been killed during the protests and blamed the US for the deaths.Additional reporting by Daniele Palumbo and Shayan Sardarizadeh",

    "body": "7 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterAFP via Getty ImagesEMI Records was one of the major players of the music industryWarning: this article contains offensive and derogatory languageJeffrey Epstein considered investing in music company EMI after his associate David Stern appeared to suggest it potentially offered access to women, recently released emails suggest.Epstein replied that he was interested, adding: \"Do we need help - mandelson? [sic]\"Stern and Lord Mandelson did not reply to requests for comment.Many of his emails to Epstein flagged potential deals, and in February 2010 he forwarded a short news article about the financial woes of EMI at the time. EMI is a now-defunct conglomerate that included EMI Records, formerly one of the major players of the music industry. It was acquired by Universal Music in 2012.\"Troubled industry but related to P,\" Stern wrote to Epstein.\"P\", which Epstein apparently used to refer to women, is believed to be an abbreviation of the word \"pussy\", another term Epstein often used.For birthdays and New Year greetings, Stern wished Epstein \"lots of P\", according to the recently released files. He once offered to get Epstein fashion show tickets \"to review Chinese P\". He would send Epstein a \"P factor\" for the places he visited, giving the Spanish island Ibiza 9/10, and Sarah Ferguson's 50th birthday party 0.2/10.The emails have been newly released by the US Department of JusticeAt the time Epstein had considered asking Stern for his help in an EMI investment, Lord Mandelson was First Secretary of State and Business Secretary in the UK government.Stern said it was \"too early to get Mandelson involved before i know more\".Epstein appears to have emailed Lord Mandelson a few days later, saying: \"please email me bens contact info.. or havehim cal me re emi. [sic]\"In reply, Lord Mandelson appears to say: \"Gave to [redacted]. Email is [redacted]. Talk re EMI ??\".It's not clear exactly who \"ben\" is.Epstein sent another reply to Stern, suggesting that if the deal went ahead, he would put US businessman and former Sony Music company CEO Tommy Mottola in charge of it.He wrote, \"my friend is tommy mottola former head of sony I'd like him to be brought in to fix it\".Mottola did not reply to a request for comment. US Department of JusticeAn image from the Epstein files showing David Stern at the opening of a new office for his company Asia Gateway in Beijing in 2011Epstein's proposed deal did not go ahead – and EMI's main lender Citigroup ended up taking control of the company.However later on, in 2011, Epstein's circle were still discussing a bid for EMI.Kevin Law, a businessmen in the US state of Connecticut who was often in touch with Epstein, apparently wrote: \"Tell your buddy Andrew from the UK if he's interested in EMI as we discussed I can put him in the syndicate w KKR.\" It is not clear if Epstein's \"buddy\" referred to here is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.PA MediaDavid Stern sits to the left of the Queen at a Pitch@Palace event at St James's Palace in London, in November 2016Law has said he \"never bid on EMI with any group nor did I ever do a business deal with Epstein,\" and said he did not know the former prince.The giant private equity firm KKR declined to comment. At the time KKR had a controlling stake in a rival record company, BMG.Stern was apparently still keen on acquiring a record company in 2011. He wrote: \"EMI may now come up for sale. Could actually be of interest to Chinese if structured properly. Also, most certainly great asset to have for P!\"However Epstein did not buy it then either.In November 2011, Citigroup split EMI into two parts and, the following year, sold it to Universal and a consortium involving Sony and record executive David Geffen.The DOJ files show other discussions between Epstein and associates about buying model agencies and fashion-related businesses, which also did not go ahead.French prosecutors have previously suspected that Epstein used his contact in the fashion industry, Jean-Luc Brunel, to house and transport young girls.More on this story",

    "body": "25 minutes agoGrace Eliza GoodwinWatch: Obama gave \"classified information\" with alien comments, says TrumpUS President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to \"begin the process of identifying and releasing\" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said \"aliens are real\" on a podcast last week. \"He's not supposed to be doing that,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: \"He made a big mistake.\"Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: \"Well, I don't know if they're real or not.\"Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. \"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,\" Obama said. \"There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.\"After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: \"I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!\" Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire \"lightning\" round of questions on the podcast.There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and \"doesn't have an opinion on it\". Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that \"based on the tremendous interest shown\" he will seek the release of files \"related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters\".The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a secret Pentagon programme to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.In 2022, Congress held the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter - setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.The following year, a US House of Representatives panel on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was \"no evidence\" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoBethany BellBBC Vienna correspondentBergrettung KalsAn Austrian climber has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter after his girlfriend froze to death on Austria's highest mountain last year.The man, named only as Thomas P in line with Austrian privacy laws, has been given a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,600 (£8,400).His girlfriend, Kerstin G, died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.In a statement sent to the BBC, the court said it considered Thomas P's previous clean record and the loss of a person close to him \"to be mitigating factors\". It said it also took into account \"the public discussion on social media, which was incriminating for the defendant\".The judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced climber who works with mountain and helicopter rescue teams in Tyrol, said Thomas P was an excellent Alpinist, but that his girlfriend was light-years behind him in terms of her climbing abilities.He said the couple should have turned back as Kerstin G did not have enough experience in winter conditions.The court also heard from Andrea B, a former girlfriend of Thomas P, who described how he had left her alone on a previous tour on the Grossglockner in 2023. She said she had been at the end of her tether, feeling dizzy and her headlight had gone out. She said she was crying and screaming when he suddenly disappeared, walking ahead and leaving her behind.Grossglockner mountain in AustriaAccording to reports in the Austrian media, the court heard how the mountain rescue team found Kerstin's body hanging upside down from a rock face.\"We were amazed that she remained in that position,\" one of the rescuers told the court. If the wind had been any stronger, \"she would have fallen over the south face\".The prosecution said there were strong winds of up to 74 km/h (45 mph), and was very cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20C, they said.They argued that as the more experienced climber, Thomas P was \"the responsible guide for the tour\". They said he failed to turn back or call for help in time to help his girlfriend.Thomas P should never have allowed himself to get into this situation, the prosecutor said.Thomas P pleaded not guilty. He told the court he was deeply sorry. He said he had loved his girlfriend, who was very sporty and that they had planned the trip together.His lawyer Kurt Jelinek said the couple had found themselves in a really difficult and stressful situation.He said Kerstin was not inexperienced and knew what she was getting into.www.foto-webcam.euThis still from webcam footage shows the couple still climbing at 21:00 on 18 JanuaryProsecutors say the couple got stuck on the mountain and that the man failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:30.Video footage from the helicopter showed the couple still climbing. The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.The defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.But shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin became exhausted close to the summit.The defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.At 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police.

The 69-year-old was now at home and recovering from a stroke which had affected his speech, his wife Marina Adamovich said.Statkevich spent more than five years behind bars after receiving a 14-year sentence for organising what the authorities called \"mass riots\" in 2020-21. He had run unsuccessfully against Alexander Lukashenko in a 2010 presidential poll.More than 1,000 political prisoners remain in jail in Belarus, rights groups say.\"He is at home, recovering,\" Adamovich said on Thursday. \"I really hope that everything will be fine. The main problem at the moment is his speech. It's bad, it's difficult to have a conversation.\"Meanwhile, exiled Belarusian leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she was relieved that Statkevich \"is free and able to hug his wife, who waited for him for so long\".\"I want to thank everyone who keeps fighting to release all political prisoners in Belarus. We must continue until every last one is free,\" she added in a post on X.They were jailed in 2020-21, when Lukashenko brutally stamped out protests after claiming victory in presidential elections that were widely condemned as rigged.Most agreed to be sent abroad into exile. Statkevich was the only one who refused to leave the country.In exchange for the prisoner release, the US pledged to relieve some sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia, allowing it to buy parts for its aircraft.Belarus is a close ally of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Lukashenko has been in power in Belarus since 1994, quashing all opposition.",

    "body": "11 hours agoAmy WalkerandTom Bateman,State department correspondent, Washington DCReutersThe UN estimates the cost of damage in Gaza at $70bnSeveral countries which have signed up to Donald Trump's Board of Peace have contributed more than $7bn (£5.2bn) towards a Gaza \"relief package\", the US president has said.Trump made the announcement during the first meeting of the organisation that many of US's Western allies have refused to join, fearing the body originally meant to help end the war between Israel and Hamas may be intended to replace the UN.  The second phase of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan includes the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza.It \"looks like\" Hamas would disarm, Trump told participants. However, there are few signs of the Palestinian group disarming. Gazans say it is extending its control over the Strip. Speaking as the Board of Peace convened on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had \"agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza\".The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 72,000 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.The enclave's economy is in ruins, with its buildings and infrastructure largely destroyed. The UN estimates the cost of damage at $70bn.Countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany have refused to join the Board of Peace that came into being last month.In an effort to address concerns that the organisation was meant as a way of sidelining the UN, Trump told the board's first meeting in Washington that \"we're going to be working with the United Nations very closely, we're going to bring them back\".Gaza, the US president said, was \"no longer a hotbed of radicalism and terror\". \"And to end that, we have today, and I'm pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7bn toward the relief package\".\"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability,\" he said, adding that the UN would contribute $2bn for humanitarian assistance, while football body Fifa would raise $75m for soccer-related projects in the Strip.Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician who has been given the title of high representative for Gaza as part of the board, said the process of recruiting a new transitional Palestinian police force had begun and \"just in the first few hours we have 2,000 people who have applied\".But both Israel and the US have insisted that the force is not drawn from the existing Hamas-controlled police without stringent vetting, nor do they want it simply made up of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. That means starting from scratch, and the task is daunting. Mladenov has previously said the Palestinian police force must be the primary security agency in Gaza, assisted by the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), and not vice-versa. According to the US plan, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.But Mladenov said there is little evidence such a force could yet oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian factions. Meanwhile, there was no indication at the meeting that Hamas was prepared to hand over its weapons, despite Trump's combination of optimism and threat on this point. So far, Hamas has publicly appeared to make handing over weapons contingent on - at least - Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.Progress on this issue is critical because none of Trump's proposals for reconstruction and governance can take place without a security force on the ground that has broad backing of the Palestinian population, given its role includes assuming a monopoly of force within Gaza.The Washington meeting itself was characteristic of Trump's approach to Israeli-Palestinian peace-making over his two terms - involving a future for Palestinians seen often through the lens of real-estate development and wealthy investor funding. Meanwhile Israel's leadership has been wary about some of Trump's efforts, particularly the invitations to his board for Turkey and Qatar, whom Israel does not want to see take a prominent role in decisions on the future of Gaza. Trump and his team have defended his unconventional approach saying it amounts to \"new thinking\" to try to solve the conflict. However, Mladenov has warned that without rapid progress, Gaza will remain split into two territories, one under continuing Israeli occupation and the other under Hamas control - and also split from the West Bank, making a future independent state unviable and failing to secure either Palestinians or Israelis.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBernd Debusmann JrWhite House reporter Getty ImagesTrump told the Board of Peace, Trump said that talks with Iran have been 'very good' but historically difficult. US President Donald Trump says the world will find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether the US will reach a deal with Iran or take military action.At the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington DC, Trump said of negotiations with the Islamic Republic about its nuclear programme: \"We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen.\" In recent days, the US has surged military forces to the Middle East, while progress was reported at talks between American and Iranian negotiators in Switzerland. The Iranian government has told the UN Secretary-General that it will regard US bases in the region as legitimate targets if used in any military aggression against Iran. Tehran's UN mission said in a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres that Trump's rhetoric signalled a real risk of an attack - but it said Iran did not want a war.Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, have voiced opposition to any potential military action in Iran without congressional approval.In his remarks, Trump noted that Special Envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is also Trump's son-in-law, had \"some very good meetings\" with Iran. \"It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran,\" he said. \"Otherwise bad things happen.\" One day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned that Iran would be \"very wise\" to make a deal with the US, adding that Trump was still hoping for a diplomatic solution over Tehran's nuclear programme. When Trump first announced the Board of Peace, it was thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. But in the last month its mission has appeared to go beyond one conflict, with many wondering if the Trump-chaired board, made up of about two dozen countries, is meant to sideline the United Nations.US missile and aircraft struck three Iranian nuclear facilities in June last year, and the White House was reportedly discussing new attack options this week. American forces have been ramping up their presence in the region in recent weeks, including the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.In previous military operations in the Middle East, the US used RAF Fairford, in Gloucestershire, and the UK overseas territory of Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean. Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces. \"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" one of Khamenei's posts read. \"However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.\"Several members of US Congress have expressed opposition to any military action against Iran. California Democrat Ro Khanna and Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie have said they will try to force a vote on the matter next week, citing the 1973 War Powers Act. The act grants Congress the ability to check the president's power to commit the US to armed conflict.\"A war with Iran would be catastrophic,\" Khanna posted on social media. \"Iran is a complex society of 90 million people with significant air defences and military capabilities.\"He also said thousands of US troops in the region \"could be at risk of retaliation\".The chances of passage in both chambers of Congress are not strong.In January, Senate Republicans blocked a similar war powers resolution that would have required the Trump administration to obtain congressional approval before launching further military operations in Venezuela following the capture of Nicolas Maduro.",

    "body": "Lion DNA helps convict poachers for first time8 hours agoAngus CrawfordBBC News InvestigationsGetty ImagesA male lion in Hwange National Park, ZimbabweLion DNA has been used to successfully prosecute poachers for the first time in the world, it has emerged.Wildlife crime experts have only just revealed how they were able to identify the individual animal from body parts found in a suspect's village, as they matched a profile on Zimbabwe's lion database.A blood sample had previously been taken from the male lion, which was being tracked by authorities in Hwange National Park - using a radio collar.Two poachers were convicted for the 2024 incident and sent to prison in what is thought to be the first prosecution of its kind.The details of the convictions and the role the DNA database played have been previously unknown.Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Traffic, which works to combat the illegal trade in wildlife, has shared the detail with us.In May 2024, authorities in Hwange National Park became suspicious after a radio collar worn by a male lion stopped working.Investigators and police traced its last known position and found a snare with lion fur attached to it.After collecting forensic evidence they questioned two men in a nearby village and discovered three sacks of meat, 16 lion claws and four teeth. These body parts would later be tested against the database, with the DNA from all matching the profile of that missing lion.TRACE, Simon DuresA lab in Zimbabwe created a DNA database of all lions in the countryBut possessing lion parts is not necessarily a crime in Zimbabwe.Having them can be explained away as old, traditional ornaments or as coming from an animal that died of natural causes.This has been an obstacle to prosecutions in the past.But thanks to a breakthrough in DNA profiling, that's now changed.The lab generated a DNA profile from the recovered body parts and compared this to the profile previously generated from a blood sample of the lion with the radio collar.The two profiles matched and scientists were able to identify the specific missing animal.TRACE, Simon DuresThe scientist was able to match the two DNA profilesOver the last eight years the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust (VFWT) has received about £250,000 from the People's Postcode Lottery in the UK to build up the DNA database of lions in Zimbabwe.The scientist at the trust, who made the discovery, asked to remain anonymous for his own safety, but said:\"Before we had access to this technology, we were only able to do species identification, but sometimes that's not enough.\"We can essentially match those claws or those products to the lion of interest that we are looking for.\"Within 10 days of the killing, the DNA evidence was presented in court.Two men pleaded guilty and were given 24 month prison sentences.The hearing was told the value of the lion was about $20,000.Richard Scobey, Traffic's executive director, said \"countries now have the forensic capability to bring, solid science-based evidence to court\" and that it will have global impact.TRAFFIC, Viv WilliamsLion bones are sold for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Teeth and claws are bought as jewelleryThis is understood to be the first time that DNA from an individual lion has been identified and used to prosecute poachers.Professor Rob Ogden has been closely involved in setting up the project and is co- founder of the organisation Trace, which promotes the use of forensic science in wildlife law enforcement.He says the prosecution gives \"a message of hope\" and shows what can be done using a combination of training, research and development and forensic casework.Recent figures suggest an increase in the number of lions being killed for their body parts which are then sold both as cultural objects in Africa and for traditional Chinese medicine.It is thought the rise may be down to organised crime gangs also involved in the illegal trade in Rhino horn and ivory trafficking.In Mozambique between 2010 and 2023, 426 lions were killed as a result of contact with humans with a quarter linked to deliberate poaching. A measure of the scale of the trade is also the number of seizures by the authorities in recent years.That includes 17 lion skulls found in Lusaka in 2021, reportedly en-route from South Africa, and a 2023 seizure in Maputo of more than 300kg of lion body parts.Which is why this breakthrough on DNA identification is seen as sending an important message to would-be poachers.",

    "body": "Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal23 hours agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos dealDonald Trump has thrown the UK's Chagos deal into doubt as he launched a stinging criticism of the plan that would see the UK hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a joint UK-US military base.The US president urged Sir Keir Starmer not to \"give away Diego Garcia\" - the largest island on the archipelago and home to the base. Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.Under the deal - which was announced last May - the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years at an average cost of £101m a year. Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.The US president's position on the issue has seen rapid U-turns in recent months - from describing the planned transfer as an \"act of great stupidity\" to saying the deal was the \"best\" the prime minister could make.UK ministers have previously said that the deal could not go ahead unless it had the support of the US.The bill, aimed at enshrining the agreement into UK law, has been delayed and there is no date set for the next stage. UK Minister Alex Davies-Jones said the bill would return to the House of Lords \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\".Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.\"Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: \"It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether.\"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history.\"Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Misley Mandarin - one of the Chagossians who had travelled to the islands - said they would have to \"drag me from my beach\".He said \"there's no reason\" for the deal \"because Mauritius never owned Chagos Islands in the first place\".\"Keir Starmer, you could be a hero right now - don't ratify that deal, cancel that deal and let Chagossians come back to their homeland as British,\" he added.The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.",

    "body": "1 day agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGettyDanika Mason is one of Australia's most prominent sports reportersAn Australian sports presenter has apologised after a clip of her slurring her way through a live cross from the Winter Olympics in Italy went viral, with even Australia's prime minister weighing in.Channel Nine reporter Danika Mason said she had \"misjudged the situation\" by drinking ahead of her appearance on live television, also blaming the altitude, the cold and her failure to eat dinner.\"I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself,\" she said during another appearance a day later, adding that she was \"embarrassed\".Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was \"pro-Danika\" and that there was \"nothing to see here\" suggesting she had been affected by jet lag.Mason stumbled over her words and talked about iguanas and the price of coffee as she reported on the day's sports events.\"Literally like the price of coffee over here is actually fine, it's more the price of coffee in the US that we're gonna have to get used to. I'm not sure about the iguanas, where are we going with that one?\" she said during her cross to the breakfast television show Today on Wednesday, apparently in response to comments from the studio hosts.With glazed eyes she then stumbled through the rest of her sports report, mixing up her words as well as the UK and the US, while studio host Karl Stefanovic could be heard laughing in the background.\"Look the cold weather is a thing, right,\" Stevanovic said unprompted afterwards. \"You can't actually move your lips.\"Social media clips of her report prompted mixed reactions from Australians. \"Good on her, nothing wrong with this. You can tell she's having an absolute ball over there,\" said one person on X, while another commented: \"If it's not a health issue, she should be sacked on the spot - very unprofessional.\"Mason, a prominent sports reporter best known for her National Rugby League coverage, appeared again on the Today show on Thursday morning.After she delivered her live report, she told viewers she wanted to \"take a moment, if that's OK, just to apologise\" for her previous appearance.She thanked viewers for messages of concern and continued: \"I'm OK, probably just a little embarrassed. \"Look, I totally misjudged the situation, I shouldn't have had a drink, especially in these conditions, it's cold, we've got altitude, and not having had dinner probably didn't help as well. But I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself.\"So in saying that, I'm genuinely really sorry and I'm thanking everyone for those messages I've received as well.\"The Today show host Jayne Azzopardi responded saying \"we know how hard you work, Danika\" while Stefanovic called her a \"legend\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent, IstanbulReutersKhaled Meshaal, part of Hamas's \"old guard\", who has already led the group, is said to be one of the frontrunnersHamas is holding an election for a new interim leader, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the armed group's affairs has told the BBC.Voting is taking place across Gaza, the occupied West Bank and among Hamas's members elsewhere. The outcome may signal which direction the movement intends to take - particularly as the US and other mediators discuss post-war governance of Gaza, reconstruction efforts and the future status of armed groups there.The elections come after most of Hamas's senior leadership were killed in Israeli strikes following the group's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage.People in Gaza have already cast their votes in secret, according to the source, but it is unclear whether the process has concluded elsewhere. When announced, the new leader will hold office for a year.Hamas governs the Gaza Strip and in recent years has had growing support in the West Bank, though its activities there are heavily constrained by the Israeli military and Palestinian Authority security forces.A US-backed ceasefire in Gaza came into effect in October, and negotiations continue over the deal's later phases.Under the proposed terms of the US plan, Hamas would have no role in the future governance of the territory. Governance would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, once it has undergone reforms.Yahya Sinwar, the overall head of Hamas, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza in October 2024, and its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an Israeli attack in Iran in July that year. Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif was also killed that July, in an Israeli air strike on Gaza.The position of overall head of Hamas has remained vacant since the deaths of Haniyeh and Sinwar, with the movement being led by an interim committee headed by Qatar-based Mohammad Darwish after the latter was killed.Under the movement's rules, the head of Hamas is chosen by an electoral college of around 86 members drawn from the General Shura Council, Hamas's top decision-making body representing Gaza, the West Bank, Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and officials based abroad.According to the official, the race is primarily between:Khalil al-Hayya, who leads Hamas in Gaza and is widely seen as aligned with Sinwar and HaniyehKhaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas abroad and one of the movement's veteran figures, who previously served as its overall leader for nearly two decadesMeshaal is currently thought to reside in Doha, Qatar.Other internal discussions have included additional names, but no formal shortlist has been announced.Impact of warThe war that followed Hamas's 7 October attack has had a deep impact on the movement's internal politics. Israeli strikes have killed senior Hamas figures and significantly diminished the group's military and political structures, weakening the influence of its Gaza-based leadership.More than 72,000 people have been killed in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says, though it does not distinguish between civilians and fighters.For years, Hamas has been shaped by a persistent internal rivalry between two broad currents.One, often described as aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, and represented by Meshaal and parts of the external leadership, is viewed by observers as more pragmatic and less ideologically rigid. The other was seen as closer to Iran, a vital Hamas ally that supplies financial backing and weaponry, and was represented most prominently by Sinwar and leaders inside Gaza.In 2017, when Haniyeh became head of the political bureau and Sinwar assumed leadership inside Gaza, decision-making shifted heavily towards the territory. The recent war, however, appears to have reopened space for figures from the movement's so-called \"old guard\", traditionally linked to Meshaal.Getty ImagesKhalil al-Hayya, seen here meeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in February, is considered ideologically close to Yahya SinwarUnder Hamas's internal regulations, its political leadership is composed of 18 members: six representing Gaza, six representing the West Bank and prisoners, and six representing Hamas abroad.Figures associated with the \"old guard\" appear to be regaining more prominence after years of Gaza-dominated decision making, according to officials familiar with the discussions.With Gaza devastated by years of conflict and its political landscape in flux, the selection of a new leader is seen as a critical step in determining how Hamas navigates mounting internal and external pressures in the year ahead.",

    "body": "Samba school that praised Brazil's Lula  at Rio Carnival relegated22 hours agoYang TianGiant robot tribute to Brazil's Lula comes last at Rio CarnivalRio de Janeiro's annual carnival parade competition continued its tradition of vibrant dance and colour, with samba school Viradouro taking the crown for its tribute to its legendary drum director.But there was an added element of entertainment this year: political controversy.An homage to the life of Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva by samba school Acadêmicos de Niterói came in last place after it received political backlash even during rehearsals.It will now be demoted from the top tier of samba schools and will have to take part in the \"second division\" Série Ouro (Gold Series) in 2027. The performance charted Lula's path from poverty as a shoeshine boy to eventually reaching the highest post in the country. Tiago Martins, a carnival parade designer at the school, called it a deeply personal story.\"The samba says it: there are children of the poor becoming doctors, and me, a child of the poor, becoming a carnival designer,\" he told Reuters. \"We wanted to tell the story of a man who did a lot for the poor and for Brazil.\"Getty ImagesMembers of Acadêmicos de Niterói perform However, the opposition criticised the decision to spotlight a sitting president as a sign of early campaigning ahead of the October elections, with Lula seeking a fourth term.Several lawsuits alleging that Lula could gain a political advantage from the tribute were filed but rejected by the courts, with opposition parties even requesting the parade to be blocked.Lula himself gave his blessing to the performance of Acadêmicos de Niterói and watched it with thousands of people from the stands in the city's giant Sambadrome arena.Getty ImagesBrazil's president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva watching the show from the standsAnother pointed political message during Acadêmicos de Niterói's performance was a display of former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro as Bozo the Clown sitting behind bars.The ex-president's son Flávio Bolsonaro has vowed to appeal a decision by the electoral court after it rejected requests by two opposition parties to prevent the parade.Many on social media also took issue with a performance by dancers dressed as a traditional family preserved in a tin can titled \"preserved neoconservatives\" as mocking Christian values.Getty ImagesBolsonaro depicted as Bozo the Clown by Acadêmicos de NiteróiGetty ImagesRevellers of the Unidos do Viradouro samba school who took the crownDespite the controversy, the parade of giant lions, dancing books and rainbow coloured plumes still delighted the crowds.The performances are judged over 10 categories by a total of 40 judges, with the top 12 samba schools competing for the title.Getty ImagesA float of the Unidos do Viradouro samba schoolGetty ImagesDancing books, anyone?Getty ImagesA sea of green and yellow celebrates the colours of the Brazilian flagGetty ImagesColour, colour and more colour was the night's unofficial theme",

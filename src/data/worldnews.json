    "body": "At least 90 people have died and another 12 are missing after days of heavy rain in Vietnam led to flooding and landslides.The Vietnamese government says 186,000 homes have been damaged across the country, with more than three million livestock swept away. Officials estimate there has been hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage.The mountainous province of Dak Lak has been severely impacted, recording more than 60 deaths since 16 November, according to news agency AFP.The floods are the latest extreme weather event to hit Vietnam in recent months, after typhoons Kalmaegi and Bualoi hit the country within weeks of each other.Some 258,000 people were without power on Sunday morning and sections of major motorways and train tracks were blocked, officials said.Military and police resources have been mobilised to assist in the hardest hit areas.The government said the most severe impacts had been observed in five provinces - Quang Ngai, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Khanh Hoa, and Lam Dong - clustered in south and south-central Vietnam.Mach Van Si, a farmer in Dak Lak, told AFP: \"Our neighbourhood was completely destroyed. Nothing was left. Everything was covered in mud.\"Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính chaired a virtual emergency meeting on Sunday morning from South Africa, where he had been attending the G20 summit. Rainfall had exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas leading up to Friday, with some areas surpassing a 5.2m level not seen since 1993. The rain is forecast to ease in the coming days.Scientists say that Vietnam has been left more exposed to extreme weather events by human-driven climate change, which has made typhoons stronger and more frequent.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsThe G20 summit in South Africa, a gathering of the world's major economies, has ended with a joint declaration committing to \"multilateral co-operation\". The declaration, which covered climate change mitigation and economic inequality, was adopted despite objections from the US, which boycotted the meeting in Johannesburg.Speaking at the closing ceremony on Sunday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the agreement showed \"shared goals\" outweighed the countries' differences.American President Donald Trump chose to abstain from the G20 because of a  widely discredited claim that South Africa's white minority is the victim of large-scale killings and land grabs. It was the first time a G20 summit was held in Africa. Indonesia, India and Brazil have led the summit over the past three years.The US will host the G20 in 2026, with the summit expected to be held at Trump's golf course in Florida. The ceremonial handover of the presidency which was meant to happen at the end of the summit on Sunday did not take place. It is expected to take place next week, involving junior officials.Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said \"it didn't matter much\" that Trump had not attended, adding that multilateralism was \"more alive than ever\".German Chancellor Fredriech Merz said it had not been a \"good decision\" for the US to abstain. He told Reuters news agency that what he had noted at the G20 was that \"the world is currently undergoing a realignment and that new connections are being formed\". Delegates also reached consensus on working towards \"just, comprehensive, and lasting peace\" in Ukraine, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the \"Occupied Palestinian Territory\".The inclusion of Sudan is significant, according to Sudanese commentator and journalist Saeed Abdalla.\"I think for the first time, [at] the G20 now they bring the Sudan conflict [to the forefront] after more than two years,\" he told local broadcaster Newzroom Afrika.",

    "body": "11 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsAn Australian man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed Hollywood star Ariana Grande has been deported and banned from Singapore.Johnson Wen, 26, was sentenced to nine days in prison for being a public nuisance and has now been \"barred from re-entering Singapore\", the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) told local media. Wen pushed past photographers and charged at the actress and singer, who was attending the Asian premier for Wicked: For Good on 13 November. Co-star Cynthia Erivo wrestled him away from Grande. Wen has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, with many accusing him of re-traumatising Grande. The pop star has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her concert in Manchester in May 2017 killed 22 people and injured hundreds.During Wen's trial, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the film's premiere twice, according to Singaporean media.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and pinned him down.Wen later posted videos thanking Grande for letting him on the carpet and said he was \"free\". Police arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance, to which Wen pleaded guilty. The District Judge Christopher Goh was quoted by Channel News Asia as saying that Wen was \"attention seeking\", adding that he was wrong to think he would not suffer any consequences. Grande has not commented on the case. Erivo spoke about the incident to NBC, saying that she \"just wanted to make sure my friend was safe\".\"I'm sure he didn't mean us harm, but you never know with those things, and I wanted to make sure that she was OK. That was my first instinct,\" she said. ",

    "body": "The granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy has announced her diagnosis with an aggressive form of cancer.Tatiana Schlossberg said she has been given less than a year to live.The 35-year-old shared the news in an essay published in The New Yorker on Saturday - the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather's assassination.The mother-of-two climate journalist has been an outspoken opponent of her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's position as US health secretary under President Donald Trump. In her essay, Schlossberg describes her alarm at watching her cousin be approved to the post as she was battling her illness. Schlossberg is the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy. She is the granddaughter of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. According to Schlossberg's essay titled A Battle With My Blood, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia after giving birth in May 2024.She described her previously healthy lifestyle, which included running, skiing and even once swimming in New York's Hudson River, \"eerily, to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society\".Despite treatment, including a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, she said doctors have told her the outcome does not look good. \"During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,\" she writes. \"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me.\" Schlossberg's son was born in 2022 and her daughter in 2024.Schlossberg, whose uncle John F Kennedy Jr died in a plane crash at age 38 and whose grandmother Jacqueline died of cancer when Schlossberg was a toddler, also describes the pain she fears her death will cause her mother, who previously served as US ambassador to Australia and Japan. \"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" she writes. \"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\" She also described her upset at watching her cousin, known as RFK Jr - whose father Robert F Kennedy was also assassinated while running for president - become Trump's health secretary.\"I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having worked in medicine, public health, or the government,\" she writes. \"Suddenly, the healthcare system on which I relied felt strained, shaky.\"Earlier this month, her brother Jack Schlossberg announced that he is planning to run for Congress in New York. He shared her essay online on Saturday, with the caption: \"Life is short - let it rip.\"The Kennedy family's generations-spanning participation in US politics - along with the personal tragedy which has often touched its members - has garnered it a prominent reputation in American life.",

    "body": "23 hours agoAleks PhillipsAFP via Getty ImagesAir traffic above the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven was suspended for several hours on Saturday after unidentified drones were spotted near the airport.Drones were first observed late on Friday over the nearby Volkel air force base. Weapons were deployed to try to shoot them down but the devices got away.After more sightings on Saturday, airspace around the airport was closed  until around 23:00 local time (22:00 GMT). Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans said authorities had \"taken measures\" without elaborating. It is the latest in a series of incidents at military installations and airports in northern Europe in recent months. Russia has denied accusations it was involved in them.As well as being used by the Royal Netherlands Air Force, Volkel Air Base hosts a US Air Force squadron as part of Nato.Officials said that for security reasons they would provide no details about how the drones were first spotted on Friday or what action was taken to try to bring them down.Drones have been sighted at other Dutch air bases in the past few weeks, as well as facilities in neighbouring Belgium, Denmark and Germany.A lack of evidence pointing to their origins has plagued investigations into the incidents since they began in September, as in many cases the drones depart after a while.Some European officials have attributed the sightings to \"hybrid warfare\" on the part of Russia, as the nations that have been targeted are all allied to Ukraine.But the Kremlin has denied it has anything to do with past incursions. Defence ministers from 10 EU countries have agreed to create a \"drone wall\" in response to the sightings, while some individual nations have sought to secure anti-drone defence measures.",

    "body": "42 minutes agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, BeirutIsrael's military has killed a senior member of the militant group Hezbollah in an air strike on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, despite a ceasefire.It described Haitham Ali al-Tabtabai, Hezbollah's chief of staff, as a veteran of the group who had held a series of senior positions.Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people were killed and 28 others wounded in the strike, which hit an apartment building in the densely populated Dahieh district.Hezbollah confirmed Tabtabai's death, adding Israel had crossed a \"red line\" in carrying out the strike.The strike is Israel's first on southern Beirut for months.It comes as Israel has escalated its campaign on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group supported by Iran - despite a ceasefire brokered by the US and France that came into effect last November.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been trying to rebuild its military capabilities, is smuggling weapons into Lebanon and stepping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles, and there are growing fears of an escalation of hostilities.In a statement after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Under my leadership, the State of Israel will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild its power, and we will not allow it to once again pose a threat to the State of Israel.\"He said he expected the Lebanese government \"to fulfill its commitment to disarm Hezbollah\".Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel - which continues to occupy at least five locations in southern Lebanon - to stop the attacks and withdraw from the country, saying the Israeli actions are a violation of the agreement that put an end to 13 months of conflict.The Lebanese government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but the group has rejected calls to discuss the future of its weapons before Israel stops its attacks, fully withdraws from Lebanon, and releases Lebanese prisoners. A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the authorities are under pressure from the Trump administration, which is growing impatient with what they see as the slow progress against the group, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and UK.The latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.The US government imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016 and designated him a terrorist. It has a $5m (£3.8m) award on offer for information about him.The US described him as a key Hezbollah military leader who once commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen, adding his actions in these countries were part of a larger Hezbollah effort to provide training, material, and personnel \"in support of its destabilising regional activities\".",

    "body": "23 hours agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, Istanbul and Jon Donnison,correspondent, JerusalemAt least 22 Palestinians have been killed in a series of Israeli air strikes across northern and central Gaza, Hamas medical and civil defence officials have said.They said five sites had been hit, including residential homes. A senior Hamas commander was among the dead, according to local sources.The Israeli military said it had struck targets in Gaza in response to an incident earlier on Saturday, when it said an \"armed terrorist\" had fired at soldiers after crossing the Strip's so-called \"yellow line\" designating areas under full Israeli control. Hamas denied this.Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire deal agreed on six weeks ago.More than 310 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire came into force, according to Gaza's health ministry.The territory's civil defence said Saturday's strikes by Israel targeted Gaza City in the north, as well as Deir al-Balah and Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.The Hamas officials said five people had been killed at the Abbas junction in the densely populated Rimal area of Gaza City. Witnesses said an Israeli strike set a car on fire.In addition, three people were killed near a mosque in Deir al-Balah, the officials said.Two houses were targeted in Israeli strikes in Nuseirat, they added, with three killed after the home of the Abu Amouneh family was hit. Seven others were killed in another strike targeting the house of the Abu Shawish family.Three more people were killed later on Saturday when a house in western Gaza City was hit, officials reported.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a later statement: \"Today, Hamas violated the ceasefire again, sending a terrorist into Israel held territory to attack IDF soldiers. In response, Israel eliminated five senior Hamas terrorists.\"The statement also called on mediators to \"insist that Hamas fulfil its side of the ceasefire\".Following the strikes, Hamas said the army's westward push of the yellow line and continued bombardment of eastern Gaza amounted to a \"blatant breach\" of the agreement.The group called on mediators and the US to intervene urgently, warning that Israel was attempting to impose \"new facts on the ground\" and undermine the ceasefire.The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "A Ukrainian refugee has become the first person from his country to win an elite-level sumo tournament.Danylo Yavhusishyn - known by his sumo ring name Aonishiki - arrived in Japan as an 18-year-old in 2022 after the Russian invasion of his country.Now aged 21, he is the first Ukrainian to claim the prized Emperor's Cup and the first European in almost eight years to do so.He is now on the verge of being promoted to the second-highest rank of Ozeki, in what would be the fastest promotion in history.Aonishiki finished the 15-day tournament in Fukuoka, Japan, with a record of 12 wins and three losses and went on to win the championship play-off against Yokozuna grand champion Hoshoryu, a 26-year-old Mongolian who won last month's London tournament.In his winning ceremony interview, Aonishiki was asked if he felt satisfied with his results after three years in sumo.\"No, I think this is just the beginning,\" he replied.The name Aonishiki contains the Japanese character for \"blue\" - a reference to the Ukrainian flag.Aonishiki is only the second Ukrainian in the top division in sumo. He first tried sumo aged seven, after also practicing judo and freestyle wrestling.He impressed in youth amateur sumo competitions, and fled to Germany with his family after Russia's invasion.He moved to Japan by himself in April 2022, without knowing the language, with the help of a university sumo club captain he met previously at a youth championship event.Despite only being in professional sumo for a short time, he has gained fans in Japan and worldwide with his impressive skills, constant improvement and competitiveness.He often defeats opponents with seldom-used techniques, receiving praise from both professionals and sumo enthusiasts.Aonishiki, who was one of the most cheered wrestlers at last month's Grand Sumo Tournament at the Royal Albert Hall in London, is tipped by many to become the first-ever European to reach sumo's highest rank of Yokozuna grand champion.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRichard Kagoe,Nairobi, Kenya and Wedaeli ChibelushiFifty of the 315 children kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in Nigeria's Niger State on Friday have escaped. The Christian Association of Nigeria says they have been reunited with their families.A major military-led search and rescue operation is under way for the remaining 265 children and 12 teachers who were taken with them.Authorities in several Nigerian states ordered schools to shut following the mass abduction in Niger and another smaller hostage-taking in Kebbi state on Monday when 20 pupils were kidnapped from a boarding school.  In another development, 38 people abducted from a church service in Kwara state last week were freed on Sunday, the state governor said.Two people were killed in the attack on Christ Apostolic Church in Eruku.Orders were given for many schools to close in the states of Kebbi, Niger, Katsina, Yobe and Kwara.News of the children's escape brought welcome relief for families and for a country that has been agonising over the fate of hundreds of schoolchildren abducted in Nigeria's northwest. According to a Christian group involved in the case, the pupils managed to escape between Friday and Saturday in what is being described as a brave and risky attempt to flee their captors.The students and teachers were taken from St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state. Earlier reports spoke of 303 students and 12 teachers being taken. Their number surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.Local police say armed men stormed St Mary's at around 02:00 (01:00 GMT), abducting students staying there.Niger state governor Mohammed Umaru Bongo announced on Saturday that all schools in the area would close, warning that was \"not a time for blame game\".Calling for the release of the abductees, Pope Leo XIV expressed \"immense sadness\" and urged the authorities to act swiftly.Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... It took everybody by surprise.\"One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"The military, police and local vigilantes are conducting a search for the children, combing nearby forests and remote routes believed to have been used by the gunmen.Authorities in Niger state said St Mary's School had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks. The school has not commented on that allegation.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs, but it has had little effect.On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state.Authorities there have now ordered all secondary schools and colleges to close.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu postponed foreign trips - including to this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.This week's attacks follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians. The Nigerian government has dismissed this claim.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority-Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok in 2014.The incident drew international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Many have since either escaped or been freed, but as many as 100 remain missing.",

    "body": "9 hours agoImran Qureshi and Jessica RawnsleySeven people have been arrested in India after a daring 70m rupees ($800,000; £600,000) heist in which armed men posing as central bank officials robbed an ATM cash van.On Saturday police in the southern city of Bengaluru said they had cracked the case and recovered 57.6m rupees of the money stolen three days earlier.Bengaluru police commissioner Seemant Kumar Singh told the BBC on Sunday that a seventh man had been arrested in Bengaluru, adding it would take time to determine the amount of money \"in his possession.\"Singh said the police are still looking \"for two or, maybe, three more,\" suspects.Those arrested include Gopal Prasad, an employee of cash transport company CMS, J Xavier, a former CMS worker, and Annappa Naik, a local police constable.The robbery took place in broad daylight in the Lalbagh area of Bengaluru. The thieves pretended to be officers of the Reserve Bank of India. They stopped the transport vehicle saying they had to check the paperwork for such a large amount of money.The vehicle's cash custodian and two security guards were instructed to get into an SUV, while one of the gang members took control of the van, police said.Police said the gang had changed vehicles, used fake registration plates and selected locations with minimal CCTV coverage to transfer the boxes of cash.A massive hunt was launched on Wednesday, with more than 200 police officers deployed across Karnataka state and the neighbouring Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Goa states.Detectives are investigating the role of CMS and possible violations of guidelines for transferring cash, Singh said.\"The vans should not follow the same route and timing repeatedly so as to become predictable,'' he added.",

    "body": "20 hours agoNicole Kolsterin CaracasBBCLike Alejandro Orellano, many Venezuelans say they are more worried about their personal finances than about a US invasionWhile Nicolás Maduro's government lives on edge under a military threat from US President Donald Trump, ordinary Venezuelans spend their time trying to figure out what to eat each day.It's Wednesday morning at Quinta Crespo, a popular market in downtown Caracas. Here, a possible escalation of the conflict is not the main concern of Venezuelans, who glance at the news while checking their wallets to find enough cash to pay.\"There's not going to be an intervention, nothing like that. What's really troubling us is the rise of the dollar,\" Alejandro Orellano tells BBC Mundo as he savours a coffee, waiting for customers who never seem to arrive.In the past weeks, Trump's government has deployed thousands of troops and military assets to within striking distance of Venezuela, including the world's largest warship. On Saturday, at least four international airlines cancelled flights into or out of the country after a Friday notice from US aviation authorities warned of \"heightened military activity in or around Venezuela\".This comes after a series of US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific killed more than 80 people.It's part of a broader effort the administration says is necessary to stem the flow of narcotics into the US, but Maduro insists the sabre-rattling is designed to push him out of office.In the streets of Caracas, daily life continues while the government tells the population that they must be ready for a US invasionAlejandro downplays the rhetoric between Washington and Caracas.He's been selling vegetables in this market for five years. \"Look, look how empty this is,\" he insists, pointing to a long, lonely aisle full of fresh fruits and vegetables.A Christmas carol plays, but the festive atmosphere feels overshadowed.The common enemy of the people is here: the sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. In part, this is due to the rapid depreciation of the bolívar, which will have lost 80% of its value this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures.A kilo of chicken, for example, costs about four times the official monthly minimum wage. And although the government offers bonuses to retirees and public workers, the money is still not enough to cover the basic food basket.Consuelo, 74, is sceptical about an armed conflict with the US and says Venezuelans cannot afford to stock food in preparation for a war.\"Let whatever happens happen! And that's it!\" she tells the BBC, adding that worrying about the spectre of war doesn't help much.\"Is it true? Is it false? That just makes you sick, walking around nervous, it's better to stay calm. Emotions can also affect your health,\" continues this retired university professor who still works.\"I haven't done any panic buying; you need a lot of money to do that.\"Two economists living in Venezuela consulted by the BBC for this report preferred not to comment for fear of government reprisals.\"Inflation has reached levels of around 20% monthly,\" another expert who requested anonymity pointed out.The IMF projects a 548% price increase this year and says it will be worse in 2026, when it could soar to 629% - the highest figure on the continent.Others see a potential US intervention as an opportunity for regime change but are afraid to speak openly about it.\"We're scared, silent, afraid they'll throw us in jail. I used to post things, but not anymore - I shouldn't - because I don't know who might turn me in,\" a merchant from Ciudad Bolívar (in Bolívar state, south) tells the BBC by phone.\"There's hope, faith, but people are quiet out of fear. You don't hear anyone talking about it; it's just at home, with your family, but there's a hint of joy,\" says the woman anonymously.Consuelo says that uncertainty also makes Venezuelans nervousMuch of society avoids speaking openly about issues that could be sensitive for Maduro's government, after a wave of arrests followed anti-government protests over the disputed 2024 presidential elections, which have been widely rejected by the international community. The opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.After the elections, more than 2,000 people were arrested, official figures show. At present, 884 individuals remain in prison for political reasons, according to the non-governmental organisation Foro Penal.Barbara Marrero, a 40-year-old pastry chef, says: \"We're all waiting for something to happen because it's fair and necessary. We've been living in absolute misery for years.\"Venezuelans live day by day waiting for something to happen, but everyone is afraid [to speak] and nobody says anything.\"Esther Guevara, 53, who works in a medical lab, doesn't hide her concern amid tensions over the US naval fleet deployment.\"I'm worried because I don't really know what's happening - they might invade, strike… people think it will be ok, but this is serious,\" she says. \"A lot of innocent people could die.\"\"I feel like something's cooking out there, but I'm waiting,\" she adds.Javier Jaramillo also does not believe that an attack on Venezuela is imminentIt's now midday.Everything goes on as usual along a busy boulevard in eastern Caracas. Street vendors pushing sales. Pedestrians coming and going.There's Javier Jaramillo, 57, looking for goods to resell at Christmas. He's curious about the USS Gerald R Ford, the aircraft carrier Washington moved to the Caribbean.\"I don't think that attack will happen. I think there could be dialogue, an agreement, or a deal.\"Still, he says that when there are power cuts, he thinks: \"'They've come in,' 'They're going to come in.'\"Trump has suggested he is open to a diplomatic dialogue with Maduro, but also said he would not rule out military action.Either way, Javier repeats: \"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive.\"",

    "body": "20 hours agoOlga Prosvirova & Zlata OnufrievaBBC News RussianAishat Baimuradova/Getty/BBCAishat told her friends she had been raised in a strictly religious familyWhen 23-year-old Aishat Baimuradova fled her home earlier this year, she believed she finally had a chance to live the way she wanted.Coming from Chechnya, a conservative Muslim republic in Russia, she cut her hair short, stopped covering her head, shaved off part of her eyebrow and posted quirky selfies on Instagram.She told her new friends she could finally breathe.In October, Aishat was found dead in a rented flat in neighbouring Armenia. Police say she was murdered.Two people were seen leaving the building where she was found, including a woman Aishat had befriended not long before her death. Both reportedly left for Russia soon afterwards.Russians do not need a passport to enter Armenia; their internal ID is enough. That also makes it an easy route for anyone trying to flee.Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus, is often described by rights groups as a state within a state - a place where power is highly personalised and loyalty to long-standing leader Ramzan Kadyrov often over-rides laws and formal institutions.For years, human rights organisations have documented enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings in the republic, as well as systematic persecution of those who dissent.Chechen officials have consistently denied these allegations, complaining of fabrications aimed at discrediting the region.Aishat Baimuradova/InstagramHer friends say Aishat was a very open person seeking connection with peopleSeveral high-profile critics of Chechen authorities have been killed abroad.In 2009, Umar Israilov, a former bodyguard of Ramzan Kadyrov, was shot dead in Vienna, where he had sought asylum. Austrian authorities called the assassination politically motivated and linked the killers to Chechnya.Former Chechen rebel Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, in an attack blamed on Russian security services.But Aishat Baimuradova is the first known Chechen woman to have died in suspicious circumstances, not long after fleeing Russia.Like many other women who escape the region, she had complained of being controlled by her family. She said she was forced into a marriage, monitored, and barred from leaving home or using her phone. The BBC was not able to reach her family for a comment.Aishat arrived in Armenia with the help of SK-SOS, a crisis group that helps people facing danger in the North Caucasus. She had complained openly of conservative gender rules and the suffocating control women face in Chechnya.At first, she worked in a small town, then moved to the capital, Yerevan, hoping for a better job and more opportunities.To many who flee, such visibility is unthinkable. Most use false names, avoid showing their faces, and refuse to meet new people. Aishat chose a different path. \"She really wanted a normal life,\" her friend who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC. \"And she wanted to trust people.\"ReutersRamzan Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya since 2007. Critics accuse him of turning the Russian republic into a state within a stateHer family tried to persuade her to come back, but when nothing came of it they disowned her, according to SK SOS.\"They said to her: 'You are no longer our daughter or our wife. We won't touch you - just don't touch us,\" Alexandra Miroshnikova, spokesperson for SK SOS, told the BBC.Her uncle told local media the family had no involvement in her death.On the night of her death, Aishat was with a woman she had recently met online, who claimed to come from Dagestan, another Russian republic in the North Caucasus.People who knew Aishat told the BBC it was the woman who had first made contact with her on social media, later coming to Armenia and inviting her to parties.A man captured with her on CCTV as they left the building where Aishat's body was found was reported by a popular Russian Telegram channel to be of Chechen origin. Investigative outlet Agentstvo identified him as a relative of a businessman close to Ramzan Kadyrov.Chechen authorities deny any connection to Baimuradova's death, condemning such suggestions as a \"terrorist information attack\". Officials have also criticised groups assisting women who flee, accusing them of \"destroying family traditions\".VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty ImagesChechen women who have sought refuge in Europe often avoid communicating with the diasporaArmenian authorities say they are investigating two unnamed people in connection with Aishat Baimuradova's murder, but they have released no further details about them.Ramzan Kadyrov is sensitive to people criticising Chechnya from abroad, says Michael Dennis, an expert on Chechen politics at the University of Texas.\"The very existence of a diaspora is a clear signal to the entire world that something is wrong in Chechnya. It's a matter of personal pride and political image,\" Mr Dennis told the BBC.Since the early 2000s, asylum seekers from Chechnya have been coming to Europe - fleeing first the war and later Kadyrov's repressive rule.But changes to EU migration policy, followed by visa restrictions for Russians because of the war in Ukraine, have all but closed that route.That leaves the South Caucasus, where Russians can travel visa-free, as the easiest escape route, but far from the safest.In July, another escapee, 24-year-old Laura Avtorkhanova, was found in a shelter in Georgia by a group of male relatives who reportedly tried to coerce her into returning to Russia. After being questioned by police she was able to stay safely in Georgia.For other Chechen women who have fled, Aishat's death has reinvigorated a fear that has haunted them since they left Russia.Several have told the BBC how even before her murder they had steered clear of community events, avoided speaking Chechen in public and restricted their social media presence. Now they worry it may not be enough to hide from those who may want to punish them.\"The fear I've lived with all my life - embedded in my DNA - has reawakened with renewed vigour,\" said one escapee living in Western Europe, who asked to hide her name and precise location.\"It's like sleep paralysis: a monster appears, and I lie there frozen, staring into its eyes. It's the fear of being killed.\"\"You can escape,\" she said, \"but you never really feel free.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, WashingtonKey moments from Trump and Greene's public falloutMarjorie Taylor Greene came into Congress as one of Donald Trump's staunchest defenders. Sworn into office just days before the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, Greene supported the president - and echoed his contention that the 2020 presidential election was \"stolen\" - when many in the Republican Party disavowed him.Now, five years later, Greene will leave Congress having been branded a \"traitor\" by the man she once revered.Over the course of just a handful of months, Greene broke with Trump in the most dramatic fashion. Although Greene had criticised Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran, his support for Israel during the Gaza War and a lack of sufficient regulation of big technology companies earlier this year, the final fracture began over Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile who had connections to the wealthy and powerful. She condemned Trump's unwillingness to order his justice department to fully release its files on the case, and appeared alongside Epstein's victims – and Democrats - to force a House vote on the matter.It didn't end there, however.Greene would also question Republican strategy during the recent government shutdown, siding with Democrats in calling on her party to address expiring healthcare subsidies for low-income Americans.She publicly berated Trump for what she said was an undue emphasis on foreign policy at the expense of addressing economic and affordability concerns.\"The American people aren't motivated by foreign wars or bailouts for other countries,\" she wrote on X earlier this month. \"They want leaders who show up, do the job, and fight for them every single day!\"Getty ImagesGreene spoke at a press conference alongside US lawmakers and Epstein's accusers at the US Capitol in SeptemberGreene continued to insist that she supported Trump, but it became increasingly clear that she has a view of the \"America First\" movement that differs from the US president's. An activist turned congresswoman who made her name railing against the political establishment had now found that the Maga – \"Make America Great Again\" - movement she supported had become the establishment.And as the weight of Trump's power focused on her ouster – she broke for the exits with a few parting shots.\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better,\" she said in her resignation statement. \"If I am cast aside by Maga Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can't even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.\"Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene announces resignation in video messageThroughout her career, she often embraced controversy and leaned into conflict. A gym instructor in Georgia, she began engaging in politics in 2016, as Trump started his successful campaign for the White House. She made frequent trips to Washington DC, where she would berate Democratic members of Congress for what she said were their socialist and pro-Islam policies.She promoted baseless QAnon conspiracy theories, questioning whether shootings in a US school were \"staged\" and alleging that the Democratic party was secretly run by a group of powerful paedophiles.Once in Congress, she clashed with Democrats - and members of her own party. Although she renounced some of her past conspiratorial views, the House voted to remove her from her committee assignments shortly after she took office.When Republicans returned to power in Congress she had a political rehabilitation of sorts, working with then Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy to consolidate conservative support in the chamber. When McCarthy was ousted, Greene fought with his replacement, Mike Johnson, and launched an unsuccessful bid to remove him as well. In 2023, she was expelled from the conservative House Freedom Caucus.She had become a political wildcard – still despised by many on the left but also viewed with suspicion by conservatives. She still had close ties with Trump, which gave her influence in Washington. And then she didn't.AFP via Getty ImagesGreene and Trump on the campaign trail in 2024In a brief interview on Friday night, Trump told ABC News that Greene's departure from Congress was \"great news for the country\".He would later post on Truth Social that Greene \"went bad\" but that he would \"always appreciate Marjorie and thank her for her service to our country\".Greene said she will return to her home in Georgia and a \"new path ahead\". Although she had reportedly expressed interest in the state's governor race next year, she recently said she would not seek that office – or seek to unseat incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff.Her decision to resign effective 5 January, however, leaves open the possibility that she could change her mind and run for office in a state where Republican politicians, like the current Georgia governor Brian Kemp, have shown that it is possible to win elections even without Trump's support.The move also allows Greene to reposition herself politically, as the Republican Party begins grappling with an environment where public support for Trump - particularly his handling of the economy - appears to be souring and the president, limited by the constitution, will never appear on a presidential ballot again.At 51, Greene's tenure in Congress may be at an end, but her involvement in American political life may be far from over.More on this story",

    "body": "1 day agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentBBCRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change. And this is not the fault of the current government or even its predecessors — it's their fault that it is so expensive, but the root cause of the problem is in Moscow.\"Top image credit: Ministry of Defence /PA Wire/ Getty Images.

    "body": "The number of Indigenous people who have died in custody in Australia has hit the highest level since records began in 1980.New data from the Australian Institute of Criminology showed 33 of the 113 people who died in custody in the 12 months to June this year were Indigenous, up from 24 compared to the previous corresponding period.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, making up more than one-third of all prisoners, despite being less than four per cent of the country's population.The figures come more than three decades after a landmark inquiry into Indigenous deaths in custody which made hundreds of recommendations.Of the 33 Indigenous deaths in custody between last July and this June, 26 died while in prison custody, an increase from 18 in the previous 12-month period.One died in youth detention and all except one were male. The remaining six Indigenous deaths in custody happened in police custody, where someone has died while police were detaining or attempting to detain them.The main cause of Indigenous deaths was categorised as \"self-inflicted\" followed by \"natural causes,\" the report found. Hanging was found to be the cause in eight of the deaths.The Australian state of New South Wales recorded the highest number of Indigenous deaths in prison custody with nine, followed by Western Australia with six. Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory each had three deaths.The NSW state coroner recently described the rising number of Indigenous deaths in custody in her state as a \"profoundly distressing milestone\".In October, Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan said the upward trend was not \"mere statistics\" and the deaths needed \"independent and careful scrutiny, respect and accountability\".The average age of Indigenous deaths in custody was 45 years, and 11 of those who died were awaiting a sentence.University of Melbourne associate professor of criminal law Amanda Porter told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the figures reflected a \"national crisis\" that required \"leadership and political action\".Ms Porter, who has attended several coronial inquests with families of those that have died, said little had changed since the royal commission in 1991 that aimed to address the crisis.\"It's maddening to see the number of inquests that I attend, the number of funerals that families have to attend, and the fact that we are 30 years after the royal commission, and the situation is getting increasingly worse,\" she told the ABC.Since the royal commission, 600 Indigenous people have died in custody which includes six in youth detention, the report said.",

    "body": "15 hours agoMahfouz Zubaide,Afghanistan producerandMattea BubaloFour Afghan men were ordered to report to the Taliban government's department of vice and virtue for dressing in costumes inspired by the TV series Peaky Blinders.The friends were told that their clothing was \"in conflict with Afghan and Islamic values\", a Taliban spokesman told the BBC, adding the values in Peaky Blinders went against Afghan culture.In videos posted online, the men, who have been released, can be seen posing in flat caps and three-piece suits similar to those worn in the series set in England soon after World War One.Since the Taliban seized power in 2021, they have imposed a number of restrictions on daily life in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.\"Even jeans would have been acceptable, but the values in the Peaky Blinders series are against Afghan culture,\" Saiful Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Taliban government's provincial department of Vice and Virtue in Herat city told the BBC.The men, all in their early twenties, come from the town of Jibrail in Herat province. They were ordered to report to the Taliban's \"morality police\" on Sunday, and presented themselves for questioning in Herat the following day.\"They were promoting foreign culture and imitating film actors in Herat,\" Khyber wrote on social media, adding that they had undergone a \"rehabilitation programme\". They were not formally arrested, \"only summoned and advised and released\", Khyber told the BBC's US partner CBS News.\"We have our own religious and cultural values, and especially for clothing we have specific traditional styles,\" he said.\"The clothing they wore has no Afghan identity at all and does not match our culture. Secondly, their actions were an imitation of actors from a British movie. Our society is Muslim; if we are to follow or imitate someone, we should follow our righteous religious predecessors in good and lawful matters.\"The men could be seen thanking officials for their advice and saying they were unaware they had violated any laws in a video released by the ministry after they were questioned - though it is unclear under what circumstances the interview was recorded. \"I have innocently been sharing content that was against Sharia which had many viewers,\" one said in the recording.He said he had been \"summoned and advised\", and would no longer do \"anything like this\".In an interview with YouTube channel Herat-Mic uploaded at the end of November, before they were summoned, the friends said they admired the fashion displayed in the series, adding that they had received positive reactions from locals.\"At first we were hesitant, but once we went outside, people liked our style, stopped us in the streets, and wanted to take photos with us,\" one of the men said, according to a translation by CBS News.",

    "body": "At least 22 people have been killed and a further 16 injured after two buildings collapsed in the Moroccan city of Fez.The two four-storey residential buildings that came down early on Wednesday morning contained eight families, state media reports, citing local officials.Several Moroccan news outlets report that the buildings - located in the south-westerly Al Massira suburb of the new part of the city - had shown signs of deterioration for several years. An investigation is now under way.Fez, in north-eastern Morocco, is one of the North African nation's oldest cities, with parts dating back to the 8th Century, as well as being its third-most populous.A search and rescue operation is ongoing to find anyone who may still be trapped under the rubble. Footage from the scene shows people and diggers sifting through the debris under the cover of darkness.In one clip, published by news site Akhbarona, a body can be seen being carried away on a stretcher by emergency services.Residents of nearby buildings have been evacuated as a preventative measure, state media reports.Those taken to hospital suffered varying injuries.The public prosecutor's office in Fez said one of the buildings had been empty but that the other had been hosting a celebration for the birth of a child when the incident occurred, state media reports.It has now opened an investigation into the cause and circumstances of the collapse, local media reports. Residents were quick to blame haphazard construction.\"People shouldn't keep building and encroaching on the next building [over],\" one of them, Abdelali, told Hespress, adding that one of the buildings had fallen onto the other.Another, Idris, said the whole incident had occurred in less than two minutes.\"It was a sudden thing,\" he told the news site. \"We were shocked, we couldn't sleep, we ran away from our homes and went outside.\"Fez was among Moroccan cities caught up in youth-led anti-government protests a few months back, with improved housing and infrastructure among demonstrators' demands.The country's housing minister Adib Ben Ibrahim said in January that around 13,700 buildings nationwide were under imminent risk of collapse.Nine were killed when a condemned building collapsed in a different neighbourhood of Fez in May.Prior to that, five people were killed when a house in the old city crumbled in February 2024, following heavy rain and strong winds.",

    "body": "Italian cooking has been awarded special cultural heritage status by the United Nations' cultural agency Unesco. National favourites including pizza are already on Unesco's list of \"intangible cultural heritage\", but now Italian cooking traditions and the way they are practiced and transmitted have been awarded. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has been pushing for her country's cuisine to be recognised since her election, said: \"For us Italians, cuisine is not just food or a collection of recipes. It is so much more: it is culture, tradition, work, wealth.\" For millions of fans the news confirms what they already believed - from Sicilian Cannoli to Calabrian 'Nduja - Italian is the best. The announcement was made during a Unesco assembly meeting in the Indian capital Delhi on Wednesday. The cultural agency described Italian cuisine as a \"means of connecting with family and the community, whether at home, in schools, or through festivals, ceremonies and social gatherings\". Koshary, the spicy dish of lentils, rice, and pasta available at countless Egyptian food stalls, was also added to the list of intangible cultural heritage. Other countries have had their \"practices, skills, traditions and social practices related to foodways\" recognised by Unesco, a spokesperson from the agency told the BBC. Previous examples include \"Washoku, traditional dietary cultures of the Japanese, notably for the celebration of New Year, Breakfast culture in Malaysia: dining experience in a multi-ethnic society, or the Gastronomic meal of the French,\" the spokesperson added. Speaking to La Repubblica, the Rome-based daily newspaper, chef Michelangelo Mammoliti said the news filled him with a great sense of pride both personally as an Italian, as well as professionally as a chef. \"Italy is one of the nations where regional cuisine has a very big impact on culture and traditions,\" said the chef, whose restaurant La Rei Natura in Piedmont is the only new three-star restaurant in the 2026 Michelin Guide. Italy's industry leaders and government ministers will be hoping that the move further boosts tourism to the country, which already welcomes 80 million international visitors annually.Luigi Scordamaglia, CEO of Filiera Italia, which represents all the food and wine companies in the production chain, told Ansa news agency that the move from Unesco marked a success \"for the entire Made in Italy supply chain\". Mr Scordamaglia also spoke about the role of the Mediterranean diet in promoting good health.He added: \"When we talk about the Mediterranean diet, we're talking about our wonderful Italian cuisine, which shares its principles, first and foremost those of balance and variety.\"Swimming pool culture in Iceland; the practice of Cuban Son music and dance; and the art of playing, singing and making the lahuta from Albania also entered Unesco's list of intangible cultural heritage.

    "body": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles and ordered the troops be returned to the state governor's control.In June, Trump sent thousands of National Guard troops to the California city in the wake of protests over his administration ramping up immigration raids in Los Angeles. US District Judge Charles Breyer said the Trump administration had not proven that that the city's protests against immigration justified taking federal control of the state's National Guard. The Trump administration still has control over 300 California National Guard troops six months after they were federalised, Judge Breyer said.Breyer also denied the Trump administration's argument that the courts should not weigh in on a president taking control of state National Guard troops during an emergency.\"The Founders designed our government to be a system of checks and balances,\" Judge Breyer wrote in his ruling. \"Defendants, however, make clear that the only check they want is a blank one.\"Judge Breyer said his order would not go into effect until 15 December, giving the Trump administration time to make its expected appeal to a higher court.\"President Trump exercised his lawful authority to deploy National Guard troops to support federal officers and assets following violent riots,\"  said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in a statement to the BBC, adding \"we look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.\"This year, Trump has sent National Guard troops to several cities, including Portland, Oregon, and Washington DC, where the deployments have also been contested in courts and, in some cases, blocked by judges.California Governor Gavin Newsom sued soon after Trump first deployed thousands of troops in June, but a court of appeals sided with the administration, saying the protests in Los Angeles justified Trump's federalisation of the National Guard.Newsom filed a new legal challenge in November, arguing the protests in the city had largely subsided and therefore the troops were no longer necessary.In a hearing in the case on Friday, lawyers for the Trump administration said the troops should stay in LA because federal immigration agents there were still being targeted.But Judge Breyer seemed to question the need for troops to remain in the city months later.\"I think experience teaches us that crises come and crises go,\" he said, according to the Associated Press.In his ruling, Judge Breyer said the Trump administration was \"effectively creating a national police force made up of state troops\" by sending California's National Guard troops to other states as well.Judge Breyer previously ruled that the way Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles this summer was illegal.All 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and several territories have their own contingent of National Guard troops.President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard to several US cities has drawn a round of legal challenges by state and local officials.Trump has argued that his use of the troops is necessary to quell violence in Democratic-controlled cities, crack down on crime and support his deportation initiatives.",

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has launched a scheme offering fast-tracked US visas to wealthy foreigners who can pay at least $1m (£750,000).The card will give buyers a \"direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,\" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.The Trump Gold Card, which was first announced earlier this year, is a US visa awarded to those who can demonstrate they will provide a \"substantial benefit\" to the country, according to the scheme's official website.It comes as Washington intensifies its immigration crackdown, including raising work visa fees and deporting undocumented migrants.The Gold Card scheme promises US residency in \"record time\" and will require a $1m fee which is \"evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States\", the programme's website said.Businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m, along with additional fees. A \"platinum\" version of the card that offers special tax breaks will also be available soon for $5m, the website said.Extra fees to the government may be charged depending on each applicant's circumstances, the site said. Individuals are also required to pay a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee before their application is reviewed.The gold card scheme has faced criticism since it was first announced in February, with some Democrats saying that it would unfairly favour wealthy individuals.When Trump first unveiled the plan he described the visas as similar to green cards, which allow immigrants of various income levels to live and work permanently in the US. Green card holders typically become eligible for citizenship after five years.But the Gold Card is aimed specifically at \"high-level\" professionals, Trump said, emphasising, \"we want people that are productive\".\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"The scheme comes as the Trump administration has devoted significant resources to deporting immigrants.The US has also paused immigration applications by individuals from the 19 countries, mostly in Africa and in the Middle East, which are subject to the president's travel ban.The government has also halted all decisions on asylum applications and said it would review thousands of cases that were approved under the administration of President Joe Biden.In September, Trump also signed an order to charge a $100,000 fee for applicants of the H-1B visa programme for skilled foreign workers. The decision caused panic among overseas student in the US and technology firms. The White House later clarified that the fee would apply only to new applicants who are currently abroad.",

    "body": "11 hours agoAoife WalshWashingtonReutersA federal judge in New York has ruled the US Department of Justice can publicly release grand jury records from Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case. US District Judge Richard Berman's ruling reverses his previous decision to keep the material sealed. He cited a new law passed by Congress requiring the justice department to release files about Epstein.In his latest ruling, Judge Berman said the victims have the right to \"have their identity and privacy protected\", adding that their \"safety and privacy are paramount\".Esptein was charged with sex trafficking in July 2019. He died in a New York prison cell a month later while awaiting trail. Judge Berman in August had denied the justice department's request because of concerns about \"possible threats to victims' safety and privacy\".But in Wednesday's ruling, he said the materials could now be released because of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was signed into law by US President Donald Trump last month.The law requires the justice department to release investigative material related to Epstein by 19 December, including unclassified records, documents and communications.It also allows the department to withhold files that involve active criminal investigations or raise privacy concerns.Judge Berman is the third federal judge to grant similar requests from the justice department since the new law was introduced. On Tuesday, another judge made a similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating Epstein's abuse.During her trial, prosecutors argued Maxwell recruited and groomed girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year sentence. Last Friday, a judge in Florida granted a different request to unseal grand jury transcripts from another investigation into Epstein from 2005 and 2007. Getty ImagesA judge made a similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell on TuesdayThe Trump administration has faced months of pressure over the Epstein files. The president was a friend of Epstein's, but has said they fell out in the early 2000s, years before the disgraced financier was first arrested. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. During the 2024 presidential campaign, he promised to make the files public, and early in the year his administration released thousands of pages of documents from the Epstein investigation – mostly flight logs. However, justice department officials in July said in a memo no further material would be released. That prompted anger from within both parties, and lawmakers introduced a resolution forcing the files' release.Trump, who previously dismissed calls to release the files, signed the bill into law in November marking a major reversal in his position. The family of Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim who died by suicide earlier this year, said Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\".The files which must be made public this month are different to the documents released by the House Oversight Committee, which had subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier in the year.US CongressImages were recently released by a congressional committee showing Epstein's home in the US Virgin IslandsThose documents included images of Jeffrey Epstein's US Virgin Islands home, which showed several bedrooms, a room with masks on a wall and a phone with names written on speed-dial buttons.Multiple survivors have alleged that they were trafficked to and abused on the island, known as Little St James, which Epstein purchased in 1998.The images from 2020 also showed what appeared to be a dental chair, and another room that had a black chalkboard on the wall with the words \"truth\", \"deception\" and \"power\" scrawled across it. The committee's Democratic leader, Robert Garcia, said the material was released to \"ensure public transparency\".Republicans, who are in the majority on the committee, criticised Democrats for releasing selective information in advance and then released a further batch of documents.",

    "body": "36 minutes agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoShares of cloud computing giant Oracle plunged more than 10% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company's revenues fell short of Wall Street expectations.The company reported revenue of $16.06bn (£11.99bn) for the three months that ended in November, compared with the $16.21bn projected by analysts.Revenue growth was up 14%, with a 68% surge in sales at its AI business, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), the company said.OCI services major AI technology developers whose demand for Oracle's AI infrastructure helped the company's shares reach new highs this fall but Wednesday's results failed to quell fears about a potential AI bubble.In September, Oracle agreed a highly sought-after contract with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which agreed to purchase $300bn in computing power from Oracle over five years.Oracle chairman and chief technology officer Larry Ellison briefly became the world's richest man in after the announcement.But the firm's shares have lost 40% of their value since peaking three months ago. Still, they are up by more than a third since the start of the year.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr Ellison struck a cautious tone.\"There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes,\" he wrote.Mr Ellison also appeared to snub Nvidia, the designer of highly-sophisticated AI chips, saying Oracle would buy chips from any maker in order to serve clients.\"We will continue to buy the latest GPUs from Nvidia, but we need to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy,\" Mr Ellison declared in a policy he called \"chip neutrality\".Oracle is involved in multiple AI infrastructure arrangements that have raised the prospect that major players in the sector are participating in 'circular financing' deals whereby companies finance purchases of their own products and services.\"Oracle's earnings arrive as investors weigh whether its massive OpenAI partnership might mean overexposure with a customer currently in the spotlight over profitability concerns,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne following the release of the company's quarterly report.Mr Bourne said Oracle faced mounting scrutiny over the increased debt the company has amassed to fund building data centres.But others said Wall Street's negative reaction was unfounded.\"This was nothing but a great quarter for Oracle,\" said Cory Johnson, Chief Market Strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research. \"Revenue growth of 14% is accelerating.\"Including the OpenAI deal from September, Mr Johnson noted, Oracle has signed $385bn in contracts over six months, and \"those new clients are the likes of Meta and Nvidia.\"\"But AI sentiment is so bad right now, that's seen as a bad thing for Oracle,\" he added.Oracle raised a record $18bn in a massive bond sale in September, one of the largest debt issuances ever in the tech sector.\"Although Oracle's shares are buoyed by its September surge, this revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending,\" Mr Bourne said.The Ellison family, supporters of US President Donald Trump, also recently purchased Paramount and have spearheaded a bid to take over another major Hollywood studio, Warner Brothers Discovery.",

    "body": "16 hours agoMatt MurphyBBC Verify      Getty ImagesTwo US fighter jets were tracked circling the Gulf of Venezuela on Tuesday as tensions continue to escalate between the two countries.The F/A-18 Super Hornets appeared on flight tracking sites near Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city, at around 13:00 (17:00 GMT), before circling the gulf for about 40 minutes.A US defence official told the Associated Press the F/A-18 jets had conducted a \"routine training flight\" in the area.The incident comes amid a wave of US strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea, which the White House said were trafficking drugs to the US from Venezuela. Experts have raised questions over the legality of the strikes, which have killed more than 80 people.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using the strikes to destabilise the country and oust him from power.In an interview conducted with Politico the day before the jets approached Venezuela's coastline, Trump declared that Maduro's days in power were \"numbered\", and declined to comment on whether US troops could be deployed to the country.A separate jet, an EA-18G Growler, also appeared just before the F/A-18s on the tracking site FlightRadar24. Data shows the jet flew loops just north of Venezuela's coast.They are the latest in a number of unusual US air force activities that have been tracked since September. B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers previously flew up to and along the Venezuelan coast.But the F/A-18s, which are capable of engaging targets both on the ground and in the air, appear to be the first to approach the Venezuelan coastline so publicly in recent months. The F/A-18s came within 20 nautical miles of the coastline, flight tracking data showed, but the US official said the jets remained in international airspace. Neither the F/A-18s or the Growler showed a point of origin or a destination on FlightRadar24, and all three aircraft only turned on their transponders when they arrived near the Venezuelan coastline. Justin Crump, head of the risk consultancy Sibylline, suggested the move was intended to \"support the administration's signalling and put pressure on the [Venezuelan] leadership\".The F/A-18s - which operated under the callsigns RHINO11 and RHINO12 - flew six loops up and down the Gulf of Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Growler jet - flying under the codename GRIZZLY2 - also flew circles along the coast. Greg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshal and president of the Air and Space Power Association, told BBC Verify that the flights appeared to be \"probing\" Venezuelan defence and trying to check for responses such as radio traffic and encrypted signals related to defence systems.\"The Growlers would have been listening for [signals intelligence], whilst the Super Hornets would have been providing air defence cover for the Growlers,\" Baswell said. He said the Growlers would also detect \"active missile sites\".\"It could be construed as the early gathering of intelligence for subsequent operations, or just a warning of such,\" he added.Crump said the jets also had the capacity to test out \"jamming capabilities\", adding: \"This also helps send a message, when successful, potentially indicating to Venezuela's leadership that these systems cannot or should not be relied upon,\" he said.The US has deployed troops, ships and jets to the Caribbean in recent months, which officials have said is to combat drug trafficking in the area.On Tuesday the US Southern Command published photos of an F/A-18 operating from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which has been sent to the Caribbean.Analysis of satellite images and ship tracking websites by BBC Verify has made it possible to identify at least nine military vessels that have been deployed to the region over recent weeks.Satellite images also show that an airbase in Puerto Rico, which was closed in 2004 by the Pentagon, has been re-activated. Repairs have been carried out to the runway at Roosevelt Roads base and F-35s - America's most advanced fighter - have been sent to the base.",

    "body": "4 hours agoYuna Ku,BBC KoreanandKoh EweGetty ImagesPark Na-rae, one of the country's most successful female comedians, has now left her popular variety shows amid allegations of workplace bullyingIn a matter of days, three big names in South Korea's entertainment industry have made headlines in separate scandals that could derail their careers.The allegations that have embroiled comedians Park Na-rae and Cho Sae-ho, as well as veteran actor Cho Jin-woong, are all different - ranging from workplace abuse to previous teenage detention to associations with a gang member.But the results have been the same: departures from the television screens where they had worked their way up to become household names.The scandals have also raised questions about the standards to which South Korea's public figures are held - especially in the entertainment industry.What are the scandals about?Park Na-rae, one of the country's most successful female comedians, made headlines last week when two of her former managers lodged criminal complaints claiming she had verbally abused and physically assaulted them.The 40-year-old had also made them do her personal chores, they alleged.Park has denied these allegations and sued the former managers for blackmail, her agency said over the weekend.She is separately being accused of receiving IV drips illegally at home, which violates the local medical law, local media reported - prompting a police investigation.On Monday, Park Na-rae announced on social media that she had talked things through with her accusers, but would halt all broadcasting activities until things were \"clearly resolved\".\"As a comedian whose job is to bring laughter and joy, I cannot continue to be a burden to my programmes and colleagues,\" she wrote on social media.Getty ImagesCho Sae-ho came under fire for his alleged links to a local gang memberAnother comedian who has come under scrutiny over the past week is Cho Sae-ho.Rumours started swirling last week that the 43-year-old was friends with a prominent local gang member and had received money to promote the latter's business.Backlash came swiftly, as social media users demanded that Cho Sae-ho be removed from the popular variety shows he hosted, You Quiz on the Block and Two Days and One Night.On Tuesday, Cho Sae-ho's agency announced that he would leave the shows - though it denied his links to the gang's business activities.In a social media statement, Cho Sae-ho said he \"should have been more careful\" with the people he met at events.He added that he had decided to step down from the shows because he did not want to \"burden\" the programmes and their production teams.The downfall that has generated the most debate comes from veteran actor Cho Jin-woong, who said over the weekend that he would quit acting.Getty ImagesCho Jin-woong announced his retirement from acting amid allegations of robbery and sexual assault as a teenThe abrupt announcement came after a viral news report that said Cho Jin-woong, as a teenager in the 1990s, had been sent to a juvenile detention centre on allegations of robbery and sexual assault. As an adult, he also assaulted a person in his theatre troupe and had his driving licence suspended for drink driving, the report said.The 49-year-old's agency said that Cho Jin-woong had confirmed wrongdoing in his youth, but denied sexually assaulting anyone.Broadcasters have scrambled to erase Cho Jin-woong from their platforms. A documentary series he narrated has now had the narration re-recorded, while the fate of Second Signal, the sequel to his hit TV series, remains unclear.A debate over cancel cultureThe allegations Cho Jin-woong faces have stirred heated debate about how much public figures should be forgiven for past mistakes.\"Why does Cho Jin-woong need to retire?\" reads one social media comment. \"Why should a flawed past remain the standard by which a person is judged decades later?\"Others, however, have argued that seeing him on screen could retraumatise his past victims.\"There are people who defend [Cho Jin-woong] by saying everyone makes mistakes when they're young, but not everyone commits this level of crime,\" wrote one social media user.More broadly, the recent string of celebrity scandals has raised bigger questions about the standards to which South Koreans hold their celebrities. It's a system that has sent rising stars into hiatus for being school bullies, and squeezed apologies out of them for simply dating other celebrities.Culture critic Kim Sung-soo tells the BBC that in South Korea, audiences want to correct behaviour that they deem unacceptable - which, in the case of celebrities, often means disappearing from the screens.\"Celebrities are easy targets because their careers depend on reputation and popularity - things that are granted by the public,\" culture critic Kim Sung-soo tells the BBC.Now, just as Park, Cho Sae-ho and Cho Jin-woong promised to \"reflect deeply\" on their actions, it appears some among their audiences are also reflecting on how celebrities are treated.\"It's absurd that people mistake this recurring pattern of targeting celebrities online - digging for flaws and pushing them out - as a moral issue,\" one person wrote on X.\"I'm tired of this cancel-culture cycle, and I think it's time for our society to seriously rethink online communities.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgA daughter of South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has been sworn into parliament, less than a fortnight after her half-sister was forced to step down.Brumelda Zuma became one of South Africa's newest MPs on Wednesday, representing uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), the opposition party led by her father.Her half-sister, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, resigned from parliament following allegations that she had tricked 17 men into fighting for Russia as mercenaries in Ukraine. Zuma-Sambudla has denied these accusations. Brumelda Zuma's appointment suggests the former president intends to ensure his family is represented in parliament.She was sworn in alongside three other MK members, who, the party said, \"bring a wealth of experience and dedication\" to parliament.She said she would focus mostly on ensuring that South Africans had \"good public services\" because \"that is what I studied\". MK said Brumelda Zuma had a degree in public administration. Brumelda Zuma has not previously had a national profile, unlike her half-sister who had represented South Africa in the Pan-African Parliament.MK previously said it was Zuma-Sambudla's decision to resign as she wanted to focus her efforts on ensuring the return of those trapped in Ukraine's war-torn Donbas region.She was implicated in the Russia recruitment scheme after South Africa's government revealed it had received distress calls from more than a dozen citizens who had joined mercenary forces.The men are aged between 20 and 39 and are trapped in Donbas.One of Zuma-Sambudla's most prominent accusers is another half-sister,  Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube.Zuma-Mncube filed a criminal complaint against Zuma-Sambudla and two other people, accusing them of luring the men to Russia \"under false pretences\" and then handing them to a Russian mercenary group \"without their knowledge or consent\".She said that eight of them were her relatives.Police have confirmed they are carrying out an investigation. Working as a mercenary or fighting for another army is illegal under South African law, unless the government authorises it. Zuma-Sambudla has said in an affidavit that she thought the men were going to Russia for \"lawful\" training.She is currently also on trial on terrorism-related charges over social media messages she posted during deadly protests in 2021. She has denied the charges.Jacob Zuma formed MK in 2023 after a massive fall-out with current President Cyril Ramaphosa. The MK party came in third place in South Africa's general election last year, and became the main opposition party in parliament after the second-biggest party joined a coalition government led by Ramaphosa.",

    "body": "Elon Musk says he would not lead the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) if he had his time again, but has maintained that its tumultuous efforts to shrink the size of the US government under President Donald Trump was \"a little bit successful\".The billionaire boss of Tesla and SpaceX gave his reflections during a nearly-hour long interview on The Katie Miller Podcast on Tuesday.Musk left Doge in May after initially promising to save as much as $2tn (£1.5tn) a year by slashing federal jobs and shuttering government programmes, among other cost-cutting measures.Doge's website, which was last updated on 4 October, claims to have saved an estimated $214bn so far this year.Conservative podcast host Miller, a former White House adviser herself who worked as a spokesperson for Doge, asked Musk whether he would do his work for the organisation again if he could rewind to the start of the year.\"I mean no, I don't think so,\" Musk replied.Instead, he said he would have \"worked in my companies, essentially\", explaining that \"they wouldn't have been burning the cars\".His comments reference a series of vandalism attacks on Tesla showrooms and vehicles earlier this year, which came in response to the highly visible political role in the Trump administration for the world's richest man.Musk's involvement in US politics sparked global protests and boycotts against Tesla, and led to a spike in vandalism of Tesla's Cybertruck vehicles. In April, the firm said sales had fallen to their lowest level in three years and warned investors that \"changing political sentiment\" could continue to hurt demand.But Musk said he believed Doge had been \"a little bit successful, we were somewhat successful\".\"You really want the least amount done by government as possible,\" he explained, adding that Doge had \"stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense\".Musk told Miller that Doge, which was created by an executive order on Trump's first day back in the White House, was a \"made-up\" name \"based on internet suggestions\". The advisory group, which is not an official government department, tackled Musk's vision at a fierce pace. It pushed for massive reductions in the federal workforce, as well as the shuttering of programmes and even agencies such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Some of Doge's moves were met with legal fights, or were reversed. When the group's cost-cutting resulted in bird flu officials at the US Department of Agriculture being fired, the Trump administration looked to re-hire them days later.Musk's time at the helm of Doge not only appeared to cause issues for his business empire - it also led to an explosive falling-out with the president himself.Musk donated millions of dollars to the Trump campaign during the election and was a fixture at the White House for months, speaking at cabinet meetings and standing behind the president at events in the Oval Office.But that relationship came to a grinding halt in June when Musk broke with the White House narrative and criticised a Trump-backed spending bill. It led to a war of words on social media, with Trump at one point threatening to order Doge to look into Musk's own business dealings with the US government.The pair's relationship now seems to be mended. Musk was spotted at a White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in November.And Musk spoke positively of Trump in his interview with Miller, saying the president was the funniest person he knows and has \"great sense of humour\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisReutersThe former French president wrote about his brief imprisonment for criminal conspiracyRushed out in under three weeks,  Nicolas Sarkozy's new book \"A Prisoner's Diary\" has plenty of colour about what it's like for a former president to find himself in the isolation wing of a French jail.We learn that prisoner number 320535 had a 12 square metre cell, equipped with a bed, desk, fridge, shower and television. There was a window, but the view was blocked by a massive plastic panel placed outside.\"It was clean and light enough,\" writes Sarkozy. \"One could almost have thought one was in a bottom-of-the-range hotel – were it not for the reinforced door with an eye-hole for the prison guards to look through.\"Sarkozy, 70, was released from La Santé prison in Paris last month after serving 20 days of a five-year jail sentence for taking part in an election campaign funding conspiracy. This is his 216-page memoir.Told he would have to spend 23 hours out of 24 in his room – and that contact with anyone other than a prison employee was forbidden – the former president chose not to take the option of a daily walk in the yard, \"more like a cage than a place of promenade\".Instead he took his daily exercise on a running machine in the tiny sports room, which \"became – in my situation – a veritable oasis\".Media thronged Sarkozy's book signing in central Paris on WednesdayThere is plenty more like this: how he was kept awake on his first night by a neighbour in the isolation wing singing a song from The Lion King and rattling his spoon along the bars of his cell.How he was \"touched by the kindness, delicacy and respect of the prison staff… each one of who addressed me by the title Président\".And how he was able to cover the walls of his cell with postcards from all the people writing to express their support. \"Touching and sincere, it bore witness to a deep personal bond even though I'd left office so long ago,\" he writes.The details fascinate. Perhaps more consequential are the ruminations on fate, justice and politics.Sarkozy was sent to jail after a court found him guilty of criminal association for allowing subordinates to try to raise election money 20 years ago from Libya's Colonel Gaddafi.At the end of the trial in October, the judge – who could have allowed Sarkozy to remain at liberty pending his appeal – ruled instead that he should go to jail. Three weeks after his incarceration, he was allowed out following a plea from his lawyers.The former president strongly denies the charges against him, and claims to be the victim of a politically-motivated cabal within the French justice system.This is all rehearsed again in the book. Indeed at one point Sarkozy compares himself with France's most famous victim of justice, Alfred Dreyfus – the Jewish officer who was sent to Devil's Island on a trumped-up espionage charge.\"For any impartial observer who knows their history, the similarities are striking,\" he writes.\"The Dreyfus affair originated from fake documents. So did mine… Dreyfus was degraded in front of the troops, when they stripped him of his decorations.  I was dismissed from the Legion of Honour, in front of the whole nation.\"And Dreyfus was imprisoned in the Santé – a place which I now know well,\" he writes.AFP via Getty ImagesThe former French president signed copies of his prison diaries at Lamartine bookshopSarkozy's dismissal from the Legion of Honour - in which as president he had served as Grand Master – is the occasion to settle accounts in the book with France's current president Emmanuel Macron.From being a close supporter of Macron, Sarkozy now says he has \"turned the page – without going so far as to enter systematic opposition to his politics or person.\"Emmanuel Macron already has too many declared enemies, vilifiers and disappointed friends for me to add to their number.\"Sarkozy's beef is that Macron never had the \"courage\" to call him in person to explain why he was being discharged from the Legion. \"Had he telephoned, I would have understood his arguments and accepted the decision,\" he writes. \"Not doing it showed his motives were at the very least insincere.\"But it is Sarkozy's relations with another political leader – Marine Le Pen – which have attracted most attention in France among reviewers of the book.  This is because of the unwonted affection that the former president displays to his one-time arch-rival.\"I appreciated the public declarations she made following my conviction, which were brave and totally unambiguous,\" he writes.Sarkozy telephoned to thank her and he says they had a friendly conversation, at the end of which he undertook not to be party to any future \"Republican Front\" designed to keep her National Rally from winning an election.Later he goes on: \"Many voters [for the RN] today were supporters of me when I was politically active… Insulting the leaders of the RN is to insult their voters, that is to say people who are potentially our voters.\"I have a lot of differences with the leaders of the RN… But to exclude them from the Republican fold would be a mistake.\"Such accolades from the mainstream are rare for Marine Le Pen and her young co-leader Jordan Bardella.Coming from a former president who still wields much influence among the traditional French right, the words are like political gold dust.",

    "body": "Venezuelan opposition leader makes first public appearance after months in hiding52 minutes agoKayla EpsteinandTiffany WertheimerWatch: Moment Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado appears on Oslo balconyVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has been in hiding for months, has told the BBC that she knows \"exactly the risks\" she's taking by travelling to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize.Machado appeared in Oslo in the middle of the night, waving from the balcony of a hotel. It was the first time she has been seen in public since January.She made the covert journey despite a travel ban and a threat from the Venezuelan government that she would be labelled as a fugitive if she made the trip.In an emotional moment, Machado waved to cheering supporters who had gathered outside the Norwegian capital's Grand Hotel, blowing them kisses and singing with them.To their delight, she then came outside and greeted them in person, climbing over the security barricades to get closer.\"Maria!\" \"Maria!\" they shouted, holding their phones aloft to record the historic moment.Earlier on Wednesday, her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa, accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her mother's behalf.The Nobel Institute awarded Machado the prize this year for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\" in Venezuela.Machado had not seen her children in about two years, having sent them away from Venezuela for their own safety. In an interview with the BBC's Lucy Hockings after her balcony appearance, Machado said she had missed their graduations, and the weddings of her daughter and one of her sons.\"For over 16 months I haven't been able to hug or touch anyone,\" she said in the interview. \"Suddenly in the matter of a few hours I've been able to see the people I love the most, and touch them and cry and pray together.\"During the BBC interview, Machado had many rosary beads hanging around her neck, which she said people had given to her outside the hotel.ReutersMaría Corina Machado jumps over barricades outside the Grand Hotel in Oslo to greet cheering supportersMachado has long denounced President Nicolás Maduro's government as \"criminal\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it.She has long been one of the most respected voices in the country's opposition but was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office. Many nations view his rule as illegitimate.Last month, Venezuela's attorney general said Machado would be considered a fugitive if she travelled to Norway to collect her prize, saying she was accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, and terrorism\".The details of her journey from Venezuela to Norway were kept so tightly under wraps, that even the Nobel Institute did not know where she was or whether she would be in Oslo in time to collect her award at the prize ceremony.Jorgen Watne Frydnes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, had described her journey as \"a situation of extreme danger\".Sitting next to her during the BBC interview, Frydnes said it was an \"emotional\" moment for him.\"In the middle of the night to have you here, it's incredible,\" he said. \"It's hard to describe what it means to the Nobel committee and to all of us.\"The Wall Street Journal reports that to escape Venezuela, Machado wore a disguise, managed to get through 10 military checkpoints without being caught, and left on a wooden fishing skiff at a coastal fishing village.The plan was two months in the making, it reports, citing a person close to the operation, and she was assisted by a Venezuelan network that helps people flee the country. The US was also involved, the report says, but it is unclear to what extent.However Machado did not give details of her journey when asked by the BBC.\"They [the Venezuelan government] say I'm a terrorist and have to be in jail for the rest of my life and they're looking for me,\" she said. \"So leaving Venezuela today, in these circumstances, is very, very dangerous. \"I just want to say today that I'm here, because many men and women risked their lives in order for me to arrive in Oslo.\"María Corina Machado and Jorgen Watne Frydnes, from the Norwegian Nobel Committee, spoke to the BBC's Lucy Hockings after arriving in OsloThere has been much speculation about whether Machado will be able to safely return to Venezuela. \"Of course I'm going back,\" she told the BBC. \"I know exactly the risks I'm taking.\"\"I'm going to be in the place where I'm most useful for our cause,\" she continued. \"Until a short time ago, the place I thought I had to be was Venezuela, the place I believe I have to be today, on behalf of our cause, is Oslo.\"After her Peace Prize win, Machado made a point to praise US President Donald Trump, who is open about his own ambitions for the Peace Prize and is locked in ongoing military tension with Venezuela.On Wednesday, he announced the US military had seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a sharp escalation in Washington's pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro's government.The Trump administration alleges the vessel was under sanction and was involved in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".The Venezuelan government accused the US of theft and piracy.",

    "body": "21 hours agoEmily AtkinsonGetty ImagesA senior staff member at France's presidential palace will stand trial over the alleged theft of precious tableware, including Baccarat Champagne glasses and Sèvres porcelain plates. Around 100 objects that were reported missing from the presidential collection were allegedly later found in the locker, car and home of Thomas M, who is reported to be the Élysée Palace's chief butler. He will stand trial alongside two others. Investigators say they found some of the items - thought to be worth between €15,000 and €40,000 (£13,000 and £35,000) - on his Vinted account. It comes just months after the Louvre Museum in Paris suffered a brazen heist in which jewels worth €88m (£76m) were taken. French media reported that Thomas M's role as head butler and keeper of precious silver involved setting the tables at state dinners and other prestigious events.He is accused of siphoning off the items over several months and falsifying the records to cover his tracks.Also among the alleged stolen goods are solid silver cutlery and a René Lalique figurine.The inventory kept by Thomas M suggested he was planning to steal more goods, prosecutors say.The Élysée has already posted a job advertisement to find his replacement, according to French media outlet TF1 Info. Officials at Sèvres - France's state-owned porcelain factory - also identified some of their items on online auction sites, including a plate embossed with an air force stamp and ashtrays.Thomas M was arrested on Tuesday 16 December on suspicion of theft, alongside his partner Damien G - a collector and manager of an online auction company.A third man, Ghislain M, was arrested a day later, accused of receiving stolen goods. His \"passion\" for rare antiques has been put forward by his lawyer as being behind his alleged involvement.According to Le Parisien - which first reported on the case - he was working as a guard at the Louvre at the time and has been barred from returning until the trial is completed.The trial is scheduled for February.More on this story",

    "body": "21 hours agoAlex BoydandLaura GozziBBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg on scene of Moscow car bombingA Russian general has been killed in a car bombing in Moscow, officials have said.Russia's Investigative Committee said Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died on Monday morning after an explosive device planted under a car detonated.He is the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department, the committee said.It added one theory being investigated was that the bomb was planted with the involvement of Ukrainian intelligence services. Ukraine has not commented.Sarvarov died in hospital as a result of his injuries, the committee said, adding it had opened an investigation into murder and illegal trafficking of explosives.Investigators have been sent to the scene, in a car park near an apartment block in the south of Moscow.Images from the area show a badly damaged white Kia Sorento with the doors blown out, surrounded by other vehicles. According to Russian media, Sarvarov previously took part in combat operations during the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the Chechen wars in the 1990s and early 2000s, and also led operations in Syria between 2015-2016. ReutersInvestigators could be seen working at the scene on Monday morningVladimir Putin was informed of Sarvarov's death immediately, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of military officials and high-profile individuals have been targeted in the Russian capital.Darya Dugina, the 29-year-old daughter of a prominent nationalist figure and Putin close ally, was killed in a suspected car bombing in 2022.Gen Yaroslav Moskalik was killed in a car bomb attack last April, while Gen Igor Kirillov died in December 2024 when a device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely.A Ukrainian source later told the BBC that Kirillov was killed by Ukraine's security service, though this was never confirmed on the record. As a matter of policy, Ukraine never officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks.",

    "body": "Ecuadorean soldiers jailed for 34 years over boys' forced disappearance18 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterJONATHAN MIRANDA/EPA/ShutterstockEleven Ecuadorean soldiers have been sentenced to 34 years in prison each after being found guilty of the forced disappearance of four boys last year.The discovery of the beaten and burned remains of the four boys, aged between 11 and 15, shocked the violence-wracked nation.The court found a military patrol had picked up the boys as they returned from playing football in the city of Guayaquil, forced them to strip off their clothes, beat them and left them naked in a desolate, dangerous and abandoned location.One of the boys called his father but, by the time he arrived, they were no longer there. Their burned bodies were found days later close to a military base near Guayaquil. In total, 17 soldiers were on trial over the disappearance of 15-year-old Nehemías Arboleda, 11-year-old Steven Medina, and brothers Ismael, 15, and Josué Arroyo, 14.Eleven of the soldiers were sentenced to 34 years and eight months in prison and five were given reduced sentences of two and a half years for co-operating with the prosecution.A lieutenant-colonel who had not been on patrol with the rest of the group was declared not guilty. The soldiers had been sent on patrol as part of the government's crackdown on criminal gangs in the country, which has seen its crime rate skyrocket as the gangs' power has expanded. Defence officials had originally said that the four children, who became known as The Malvinas Four after the neighbourhood the were from, had been stopped by the patrol because they were suspects in a robbery.But the judge ruled that they had been \"innocent victims of a state crime\" and ordered that their families be issued with an official apology and that the four victims be commemorated with a plaque.He also ordered that military personnel undergo human rights training.The judge said that evidence provided by the five soldiers who had co-operated with the prosecution had revealed the cruelty with which the 16 soldiers on patrol had acted. He said that they had deliberately taken the four boys to a desolate area, where they subjected them to racist insults, beatings and even a simulated execution.Defence lawyers had argued that because the boys were alive when the soldiers left, the accused were not responsible for their death.But the judge concluded that leaving them in such a dangerous and desolate location \"was the cause of the victims' death\". It is not known who burned the bodies.",

    "body": "Spain's Christmas lottery has been welcomed as an \"injection of hope\" in the northwest of the country, where the jackpot handed out hundreds of millions of euros just months after wildfires had caused devastation.Most of the first-prize-winning tickets in the lottery, known as El Gordo, had been bought by people in small towns in the province of León. A single ticket, or décimo, costing €20 (£17), is worth €400,000 (£349,484) if it bears the winning number, in this case 79432. Décimos come in strips of 10 and when many strips of the same number are sold to a group of neighbours or workmates, there is potential for a massive jackpot.People in the town of La Bañeza shared out €468m (£409m). Among the recipients were members of a local football club in the town, which has a population of around 11,000.The jackpot came four months after forest fires had torn through León, burning 8,000 hectares (31 sq miles) of land surrounding La Bañeza and killing a local man, 35-year-old Abel Ramos. The sparsely populated, heavily forested north-west of Spain is used to wildfires, although during this record-breaking year, the area was particularly severely affected. Firefighters battled enormous blazes in León and the neighbouring Galicia region throughout much of August and during the summer 0.8 percent of the country's total surface area was burned.According to the mayor of the town, Javier Carrera, the lottery win \"means for La Bañeza an injection of excitement and hope,\" he told Spanish media. Carrera also mentioned the closure this year of a local sugar-beet factory which caused the loss of dozens of jobs.Another town in the León province that was heavily affected by the summer's fires, Villablino, also took a massive share of the jackpot, receiving €200 million (£175m).\"We needed some good news,\" said the mayor, Mario Rivas.On top of the blazes, five local men were killed in two separate mining accidents in nearby Asturias this year.\"It doesn't make up for the loss of the lives of our friends, but this shows us that there can also be good news,\" said Rivas.Most of the winning tickets in Villablino were sold by a local Alzheimer's association.In addition, the town of La Pola de Gordón, also in León and with a population of 3,000, shared out 60 million euros. Sixty-four million euros of jackpot money also went to a working-class district in Madrid.In Villablino, Maribel Martín had one of the winning décimos, worth €400,000 (£349,484). She was out doing grocery shopping when her son called her to give her the good news.\"We were really down and 200 million euros is a wonderful thing,\" she saidShe is clear what she wants to do with the prize money. \"Spread it around a bit and enjoy life,\" she said.",

    "body": "11 hours agoKwasi AsieduandOsmond ChiaThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy, according to pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.It is the first pill of its kind to receive approval from the regulator, marking a new era for weight-loss drugs.Wegovy's Danish makers Novo Nordisk said the once-daily pill was a \"convenient option\" to the injectable and would provide the same weight loss as the shot. It comes after Wegovy was approved by the FDA specifically for weight loss.Others like Ozempic, which has similar weight-loss effects, were primarily approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.The BBC has contacted the FDA for comment.The Wegovy pill showed an average weight loss of 16.6% during Novo Nordisk's trials, the firm said on Monday.A third of around 1,300 participants experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the same trial, it added.The pill is expected to be launched in the US in early January 2026.\"Patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy injection,\" said Mike Doustdar, the firm's chief executive.The pill version of Wegovy could give Novo Nordisk's sales a boost after a challenging year which saw its shares slide as it warned over its profits.The company has faced intense competition in the weight-loss market from rival drugmakers like Eli Lilly.Novo Nordisk's shares rose by almost 10% in after-hours trade in New York after the announcement.",

She had maybe three inches of air gap to breathe in.\"And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.\"Earlier the Mexican Navy Secretariat said search and rescue operations were under way in co-ordination with the US Coast Guard.Video taken near Scholes International Airport in Galveston showed rescuers including a dive team working in dense fog.In a statement shared on X, the Michou y Mau Foundation sent \"our deepest condolences to the families of the victims of this tragedy\".",

    "body": "Vince Zampella, who co-created the  popular video game series Call of Duty, has died in a car crash in California, aged 55. Zampella's death was confirmed by Electronic Arts, which owns Respawn Entertainment, a game studio he co-founded.The influential video game developer was travelling in a Ferrari with another person, when it crashed and caught fire on a highway in Los Angeles on Sunday. \"This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince's family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,\" a spokesperson for Electronic Arts told the  BBC.Officials said the person on the vehicle's passenger seat was ejected while the driver remained trapped. It is unclear if Zampella was driving the car and who the other person inside was. Both people inside the vehicle died. \"For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed,\" the California Highway Patrol said in a statement to the BBC. Zampella created Call of Duty with his long time collaborators Jason West and Grant Collier in 2003. Partly inspired by events in World War II, the game has sold more than 500 million copies making owners Microsoft's Activision one of the most profitable gaming companies. It has also spawned an upcoming live-action film.The Call of Duty franchise was not his only success. He was also behind other widely popular games including the Medal of Honor, Titanfall and Apex Legends.Journalist and Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, who wrote a book about the making of Titanfall, called Zampella a \"dear friend\" in a post on X and a \"visionary executive\" who \"never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency\".\"While he created some of the most influential games of our time, I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him,\" he said. \"It's heartbreaking that we'll never get to play it.\"\"He really cared about the player experience,\" Keza MacDonald, the Guardian's video games editor, told BBC Newshour.\"He cared about making games, he cared about how people felt when they played and that really came across whenever you spoke to him.\"In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which publishes the Call of Duty games, and the pair were subsequently locked in a long dispute with the company which they settled out of court in 2012.At Electronic Arts, Zampella worked on Battlefield 6, which is seen as a direct competitor to Call of Duty.Infinity Ward, the American company that developed Call of Duty, said Zampella \"will always have a special place in our history\".\"Your legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment is immeasurable,\" the company said in a statement on X.",

    "body": "33 minutes agoEmir Nader,JerusalemandDavid GrittenIsrael's parliament has extended an order allowing the government to shut down foreign broadcasters operating in the country.The legislation, passed by 22 votes to 10, expands temporary powers introduced during the Gaza war to shutter outlets seen as a threat to national security.It allows the government for the next two years to cease operations of a foreign outlet even in peace time and without the need for a court order.Originally dubbed the \"Al Jazeera Law\", the powers were used to shut down the Qatari-owned channel's offices and block its broadcasts in May 2024.Israel accused Al Jazeera - which has been a strong critic of Israel's military campaign in Gaza - of anti-Israel bias and of supporting Hamas in its coverage.Al Jazeera denied the accusations and condemned Israel's actions, calling it a \"criminal act\" and an attack on press freedom.The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) said last year that the temporary order violated \"freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press, and blocks citizens and residents from receiving a variety of information that does not fit the Israeli narrative or is not broadcast on Israeli media channels\".The legislation extending the order was passed hours after the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to shut down Army Radio, or Galei Tzahal (GLZ), a state-funded station that is operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) but is editorially independent.Under the plan proposed by Defence Minister Israel Katz, the station will cease operations by 1 March 2026.Katz argued that Army Radio, which employs both active duty soldiers and civilians, \"no longer serves as a mouthpiece and ear for soldiers and broadcasts political and divisive content that is not in line with IDF values\".Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the cabinet meeting that a station broadcasting under the authority of the military was highly unusual. \"I think it exists in North Korea and maybe a few other countries, and we probably don't want to be counted among them,\" he said.The Union of Journalists and Journalists' Organisations said they would petition the High Court of Justice against the decision, calling it \"a severe and unlawful infringement on freedom of expression and freedom of the press\". The Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) think tank said shutting Army Radio constituted a serious violation of freedom of expression and effectively wiped out half of Israel's independent public radio news broadcasts.\"The decision to shut down a public media organisation is not an isolated move. It is part of a broader and worrying pattern of ongoing harm to Israeli democracy,\" it warned.",

    "body": "'A miracle': Officer shot in head during Bondi attack home from hospital6 hours agoYang TianSydneyPA MediaJack Hibbert had been working as a police officer for just months before he was shotA young police officer who was shot in the head during the Bondi Beach attack has been released from hospital.Probationary Constable Jack Hibbert - who is just four months into the job - was patrolling a Hanukkah event when two gunmen opened fire, injuring over 40 people and killing 15.The 22-year-old, who was also hit in the shoulder, has lost vision in one of his eyes but is now recovering at home, his family confirmed in a statement.\"As a family, we couldn't ask for anything more - having our Jack home, especially for Christmas, truly feels like a miracle.\"They thanked the public for their \"overwhelming support\" and praised medical staff for their \"exceptional\" care and dedication.\"While he is home, he is still recovering and will need space, support, and continued positive thoughts during this time,\" the statement added.Even after he was shot during the attack, Constable Hibbert continued to help festival attendees until he physically couldn't, his family previously said.\"Many of his colleagues who were present on the night of the incident have visited in hospital and given testaments to Jack's bravery during the incident... They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger,\" they said.He was one of two police officers injured in the shooting, with the second officer Constable Scott Dyson, 25, still recovering from his injuries in hospital, according to the last police update.Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon visited Constable Hibbert in hospital, praising him as a \"positive young man\".Lanyon added that the force would rally around Constable Hibbert and find \"appropriate duties for him\" after his recovery.Police have alleged the suspected gunmen were inspired by Islamic State ideology and targeted the Jewish festival in what has been declared a terror attack.Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.On Monday, new court documents alleged the pair \"meticulously\" planned the attack for months, and two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.",

    "body": "10 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA top Amazon executive has said the US technology giant has blocked more than 1,800 job applications from suspected North Korean agents.North Koreans tried to apply for remote working IT jobs using stolen or fake identities, Amazon's chief security officer Stephen Schmidt said in a LinkedIn post.\"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" he said, adding that this trend is likely to be happening at scale across the industry, especially in the US.Authorities in the US and South Korea have warned about Pyongyang's operatives carrying out online scams.Amazon has seen a nearly one-third increase in job applications from North Koreans in the past year, said Mr Schmidt in his post.He said the operatives typically work with people managing \"laptop farms\"  - referring to computers based in the US that are run remotely from outside of the country.The firm used a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and verification by its staff to screen job applications, he said.The strategies used by such fraudsters have become more sophisticated, Mr Schmidt said.Bad actors are hijacking dormant LinkedIn accounts using leaked credentials to gain verification. They target genuine software engineers to appear credible, he said, urging firms to report suspicious job applications to the authorities.Mr Schmidt warned employers to look out for indicators of fraudulent North Korean job applications, including incorrectly formatted phone numbers and mismatched education histories.In June, the US government said it had uncovered 29 \"laptop farms\" that were being operated illegally across the country by North Korean IT workers.They used stolen or forged identities of Americans to help North Korean nationals get jobs in the US, said the Department of Justice (DOJ).It also indicted US brokers who had helped secure jobs for the North Korean operatives.In July, a woman from Arizona was sentenced to more than eight years in jail for running a laptop farm to help North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at more than 300 US companies.The DOJ said the scheme generated more than $17m (£12.6m) in illicit gains for her and Pyongyang.",

    "body": "In rebel-held Myanmar, civilians face devastating air strikes and a sham election2 days agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent in MyanmarAamir Peerzada/BBCSome Burmese refugees who fled Chin state are now taking shelter across the border in IndiaLate one night last month Iang Za Kim heard explosions in a neighbouring village, then fighter jets flying overhead. She ran out of her home to see smoke rising from a distance.\"We were terrified. We thought the junta's planes would bomb us too. So we grabbed what we could – some food and clothes and ran into the jungles surrounding our village.\"Iang's face quivers as she recounts the story of what happened on 26 November in K-Haimual, her village in Myanmar's western Chin State, and then she breaks down.She's among thousands of civilians who've fled their homes in recent weeks after the Burmese military launched a fierce campaign of air strikes, and a ground offensive in rebel-held areas across the country, to recapture territory ahead of elections starting on 28 December.Four other women sitting around her on straw mats also start crying. The trauma of what they've gone through to make it to safety is clearly visible.While the air strikes were the immediate cause for Iang to flee, she also doesn't want to be forced to participate in the election.\"If we are caught and refuse to vote, they will put us in jail and torture us. We've run away so that we don't have to vote,\" she says.Aamir Peerzada/BBCIang Za Kim had to flee her home after the junta launched air strikes nearbySome from Chin state have described the junta's latest offensive as the fiercest it has launched in more than three years.Many of the displaced have sought refuge in other parts of the state. Iang is among a group that crossed the border into India's Mizoram state. Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.Indian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.Ral Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.\"We're afraid of our own government. They are extremely cruel. Their military has come into our and other villages in the past, they've arrested people, tortured them, and burned down homes,\" he says.It isn't easy to speak to Burmese civilians freely. Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.During its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.The Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.The BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October. Two students –Johan Phun Lian Cung, who was seven, and Zing Cer Mawi, 12 - were killed as they were attending lessons. The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.Myanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.This is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family – a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village. Now they're homeless again.\"I can't find the words to explain how painful and hard it is and what a difficult decision it was to make to leave. But we had to do it to stay alive,\" he says.\"I want the world to know that what the military is claiming – that this election is free and fair – this is absolutely false. When the main political party is not being allowed to contest the election, how can there be genuine democracy?\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCBawi Nei Lian (left) says the scheduled elections are a shamThe National League for Democracy party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, will not be contesting as most of its senior leaders including  Suu Kyi are in jail.\"We don't want the election. Because the military does not know how to govern our country. They only work for the benefit of their high-ranking leaders. When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's party was in power, we experienced a bit of democracy. But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.Iang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"The election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January. Rebel groups have called it a sham.At the base of the Chin National Front in Myanmar, the most prominent rebel group operating in the state, the group's Vice Chairman Sui Khar says: \"This election is only being held to prolong military dictatorship. It's not about the people's choice. And in Chin State, they hardly control much area, so how can they hold an election?\"He points out the areas where the most intense fighting is ongoing on a map and tells us nearly 50 rebel fighters have been injured in just the past month. There have been deaths too, but so far the groups have not released a number.\"There are columns of hundreds of soldiers trying to advance into the northern part of Chin state from four directions,\" Sui Khar says. \"The soldiers are being supported by air strikes, artillery fire and by drone units.\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCAbel lost his right leg and his hands were severely wounded fighting against the juntaAccess to the base is extremely rare. Set amid thickly forested mountains, it is the heart of the resistance against the junta in Chin state.Sui Khar takes us to the hospital at the base. We see a group of injured fighters who were brought in overnight and had to undergo hours of surgery. Some of them have had to undergo amputations.Many of them were just schoolboys when the coup occurred in 2021. Just about adults now, they've let go of their dreams to fight on the frontline against the junta.Abel, 18, is in too much pain to speak. He was with a group of fighters trying to take back territory the junta captured a week ago. They won the battle, but Abel lost his right leg and has serious injuries to his hands as well.In a bed next to him is Si Si Maung, 19, who's also had a leg amputated.\"As the enemy was retreating we ran forward and I stepped on a landmine. We were injured in the explosion. Then we were attacked from the air. The airstrikes make things very difficult for us,\" he says. \"I've lost a leg, but even if I've to give up my life I'm happy to make the sacrifice so that future generations have a better life.\"The impact of the ferocity of the latest offensive is visible in room after room at the hospital.Yet, it's the support and grit of tens of thousands of youngsters like Si Si Maung, who picked up arms to fight against the junta, that have helped the rebels make rapid advances against a much more powerful rival in the past four-and-a-half years.Some like 80-year-old Ral Uk Thang hope that after the election, the junta will retreat, and he will be able to go back home.\"But I don't think I will live to see democracy restored in Myanmar,\" he says. \"I hope my children and grandchildren can witness it some day.\"Additional reporting by Aamir Peerzada, Sanjay Ganguly and Aakriti Thapar",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said the US will keep or sell the crude oil contained on tankers it has seized off the coast of Venezuela, as well as the vessels themselves.The US president's comments came as Washington continues to pressure the South American country's leader Nicolás Maduro to stand down.Speaking to reporters in Florida on Monday, Trump said of the oil \"we're going to keep it\", adding: \"Maybe we will sell it, maybe we will keep it. Maybe we'll use it in the Strategic Reserves. We're keeping the ships also.\"The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil revenues to fund drug-related crime, while Caracas has condemned the seizures as \"piracy\".The US military has seized two oil tankers this month, including one on Saturday.Trump issued his latest warning as the US Coast Guard continued to pursue a third oil tanker, which authorities described as part of a Venezuelan \"dark fleet\" used to evade US sanctions.\"It's moving along, and we'll end up getting it,\" Trump said. Separately on Monday, the US military said it carried out a strike on what it said was a suspected trafficking vessel in international waters in the eastern Pacific. US Southern Command said one person was killed.When asked whether the goal of the seizures was to force Maduro from power, Trump responded: \"Well, I think it probably would... That's up to him what he wants to do. I think it'd be smart for him to do that. But again, we're gonna find out.\"The US has been building up its military presence in the Pacific and Caribbean Seas and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.It has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.Speaking on Monday, Trump repeated that the US intends to strike targets on land too.He said: \"We'll be starting the same programme on land. If they want to come by land, they're going to end up having a big problem. They're going to get blown to pieces, because we don't want our people poisoned.\"Speaking on state television, Maduro responded to Trump by saying: \"He would be better off in his own country dealing with economic and social issues and the world would be better off if he focused on his own country's affairs.\"Since returning to office in January, Trump has doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture, accusing him of being \"one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world\".The Trump administration has designated Maduro's government as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO), and last week ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela.As the Venezuelan government relies heavily on oil exports to finance public spending, the latest measures have sparked outrage among officials in Caracas.At Venezuela's request, the UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss what the government has described as \"ongoing US aggression\".",

    "body": "Officials from Thailand and Cambodia will meet next week to discuss the possibility of reviving a ceasefire, Thailand's foreign minister said, as deadly border clashes entered a third week. Both countries had signed a ceasefire earlier in July, brokered by US President Donald Trump. But fighting broke out again earlier this month - which both countries have blamed each other for. On Monday, top officials from both countries met at a summit in Malaysia, their first first face-to-face meeting since fighting resumed.Speaking afterwards, Thailand's Foreign Minister said the July ceasefire was \"rushed\", saying it was because the US \"wanted the declaration signed in time for Trump's [visit]\".\"We were sometimes in a rush because the US wanted it signed by the visit of President Trump,\" said Sihasak Phuangketkeow.\"But sometimes we really just [need to] sit down, trash things [out]...  make sure that the ceasefire reflects... the situation on the ground. And the ceasefire is one that really holds.\"Mr Phuangketkeow said a meeting between military officials from both Thailand and Cambodia would take place on 24 December, and that this would need to happen before any ceasefire agreement could be reached. Cambodia has yet to comment on the matter. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the renewed fighting this month. Both countries have blamed each other for the fresh hostilities. The most recent fighting has seen the exchange of artillery fire along the 800km (500-mile) border. Thailand has also launched air strikes targetting Cambodian positions.At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) meeting on Monday, Malaysia's foreign minister had asked both sides and other Asean members to give the matter \"our most urgent attention\".\"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation for the people we serve,\" Mohamad Hasan told his counterparts, according to news agency AFP.The conflict has been the worst between Asean member states since the association was founded in 1967. The failure to contain it represents a serious blow to the bloc's credibility.The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.China's special envoy for Asian affairs, Deng Xijun, visited Phnom Penh last week. A statement from Beijing said he reaffirmed that China would continue to play a constructive role in facilitating dialogue between Cambodia and Thailand.On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at the daily press briefing that China had been mediating the confict in its own way since fighting restarted this month. He added that Beijing would release information on the mediation conducted by Deng \"in due course\".The argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years. But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on  24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.The two countries later agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump - who at the time threatened to stop tariff negotiations until the hostilities stopped.The US president later oversaw the signing of what he dubbed \"the Kuala Lumpar peace accord\" in October. Thailand refused to call it that - instead referring to it as \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\".But that ceasefire fell apart in December, with both sides blaming each other for re-igniting the fighting, which has seen air strikes and exchanges of artillery fire.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Thanyarat Doksone",

    "body": "It was supposed to be just another Thursday in Laos, where Anthonin's father was born.Instead, the 30-year-old French citizen found himself among more than 140 people, mostly tourists, on a ferry that capsized in the Mekong River. All but three are thought to have made it to safety.Videos online show a scene of chaos - people screaming for help, children crying and passengers scrambling to get their belongings.Anthonin, who declined to give his full name, recalls seeing a mother and her two children on board the ferry - but they were nowhere to be seen on the rescue boat.On Monday, Lao media reported that the body of a woman, named Pany Her, had been retrieved from the river. Rescuers then found the body of a one-year-old, who they believe was one of her children. Efforts to find a second child are continuing.The boat was making its way last Thursday from the riverside town of Huay Xay to the historic city of Luang Prabang in northern Laos, a common route along the Mekong - and popular with visitors to the country.There were 118 tourists and 29 locals, including four crew, on board the boat when it struck underwater rocks, according to an official report carried by the Laotian Times.Within minutes, the ferry began to sink.\"The [crew] were just totally unprepared for that. There was a lot of confusion... it happened really, really fast,\" Anthonin said.\"What was, you know, puzzling and alarming is that there were very few life jackets, around like, 15 life jackets maximum... [it] was really bad.\"As the boat continued to capsize, passengers shouted to a passing boat for help, but it did not stop - possibly because, according to him, it was relatively small.The second one, however, did stop and take them in. However, according to British tourist Bradley Cook, another passenger on board, that briefly \"made it worse\".The 27-year-old told the BBC that as the rescue boat came closer to their ferry, people started to shift and put weight on one side of the ferry, causing water to fill up the hull even quicker.Mr Cook went to the other side to climb up on the roof, from where he jumped onto the rescue ferry.Some people managed to climb over to the ferry, while others swam for it, hung onto the rails and got pulled up by others. Both Anthonin and Mr Cook were among those rescued.But others were less fortunate.Anthonin says he was helping some other passengers retrieve their luggage at the back of the sinking ferry when he saw a Lao mother and her two children.However, when he was on the rescue ferry, he realised they weren't there.\"Some people were crying, panicking. It was a mess,\" he said. \"[But] I didn't fear for my life... I was more affected by the three missing people.\"Lao media later reported that the body of the Lao woman Pany Her and a one-year-old child were found, separately, near Luang Prabang.Another passenger, Gabrielius Baranovičius, 19, told the BBC that he and his friend, both of whom are from Lithuania, did not panic at first.\"We were just joking around,\" Mr Baranovičius said, adding that his attitude quickly changed when he realised they were sinking.After getting on the rescue boat, Mr Baranovičius said he starting filming what was happening on board \"but then I heard other people screaming so [I] turned off the camera and went straight to help other people in the water get on the boat.\"Tens of thousands of tourists use slow boat and speedboat services every year along the 300km (185-mile) route connecting Huay Xay, Pak Beng and Luang Prabang, according to the Mekong River Commission.For Mr Cook, the experience was \"terrifying\" and it made him want to get out of Luang Prabang, \"although everyone's really friendly here\", because it was a constant reminder of his narrow escape.Speaking to the BBC from Vang Vieng, a town in northern Laos, Mr Cook said he planned to file for insurance claims for his electrical items that were broken and for cash that was lost, though he was not sure who would be held responsible.\"I'm assuming it's just a freak accident,\" he said, though he added he \"was not sure how avoidable\" the ferry capsizing was.It's not the first time such a sinking has occurred in Laos.In September 2023, a passenger boat, which travelled on the same river corridor between Huay Xai and Luang Prabang, capsized in the Mekong in Pakbeng district, resulting in three deaths.The boat reportedly became entangled in a fishing net, causing loss of control and the vessel overturning in strong currents.",

    "body": "Baby followed by BBC back in Gaza hospital after treatment abroad17 hours agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondentBBCSiwar Ashour spent six months in Jordan after being evacuated from GazaA one-year-old Palestinian girl evacuated from Gaza with severe nutritional problems is back in hospital in the territory after being returned there from Jordan. Siwar Ashour, whose story the BBC has followed for several months, was repatriated to Gaza on 3 December after completing her medical treatment in Amman.She'd spent six months in hospital there under a medical evacuation programme run by the Kingdom of Jordan. Her grandmother, Sahar Ashour, said she became ill three days after coming back.\"She started having diarrhoea and vomiting and her situation keeps getting worse. The diarrhoea won't go away,\" she told a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering Gaza independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago.Siwar is being treated at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza Strip where Dr Khalil al-Daqran told the BBC she is \"receiving the necessary treatment, but the situation is still bad for her\". The doctor said Siwar was suffering from a gastro-intestinal infection. She has an immune system deficiency which makes it hard for her to fight bacteria. She also struggles to absorb nutrition, meaning she requires specialised baby formula.Dr Khalil al-Daqran said poor hygiene conditions had disease to spreadDr Daqran said that hospitals in Gaza - many of which were badly damaged by Israeli bombing and fighting nearby with Hamas before a ceasefire took effect in October - were seeing an increase in child admissions. Poor hygiene conditions caused by the destruction of vital infrastructure have led to the spread of infections and disease.\"Since the ceasefire was announced, the number of child patients arriving at Gaza Strip hospitals is three times the capacity… The situation at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is no different from other hospitals in the Gaza Strip.\"It suffers from a severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies, and a major shortage regarding electric generators, which are the main artery to keep a hospital going.\"The World Health Organization (WHO) described humanitarian needs in Gaza as \"staggering, with current assistance addressing only the most basic survival requirements\".Siwar was evacuated to Jordan in June after the BBC reported on her case and raised it directly with the Jordanian authorities.Jordan's Minister of Communications, Dr Mohammed al-Momani, told us that Siwar was among 45 children returned to Gaza after completing their treatment. Under the evacuation scheme all patients are sent back after medical attention.I put it to Dr al-Momani that people might find it hard to accept that a child in such a vulnerable condition could be sent back to Gaza in the current conditions.\"No patient is sent back before they finish their medical treatment… the first reason [why they are returned] is that this will allow us to bring more patients from Gaza. We cannot take all of them at once. We have to take them in batches. So far we have taken 18 batches. \"The second reason is that we don't want to contribute in any shape or form to the displacement of Palestinians from their land and all patients are told… after treatment you are sent back so other patients and other children can be brought in for treatment.\"Dr Mohammed al-Momani says patients are sent back from Jordan after medical treatment to allow authorities to bring in new patients from GazaJordan also treats war wounded at its field hospital in Gaza and has supplied aid via air drops and road convoys. The kingdom hosts more than 2 million Palestinian refugees, who fled conflicts with Israel since 1948, and 500,000 refugees from other countries, mostly Syrians.Since last March some 300 sick and wounded children and 730 parents and guardians have been brought to Jordan out of 2000 scheduled for treatment. Other countries in the region like the United Arab Emirates and Turkey have treated thousands of sick civilians from Gaza.The specialised formula milk Siwar needs was either not available or in very short supply during the ongoing conflict. In March, Israel imposed a total blockade on aid into Gaza that was lifted partially after 11 weeks. Since the ceasefire there has been a surge in aid deliveries, although the UN and aid agencies say not enough humanitarian supplies are flowing.Siwar's family are trying to get her evacuated once more due to her conditionThe Jordanian authorities gave Siwar's family a supply of 12 cans of the hypoallergenic Neocate formula on their departure for Gaza. However her mother Najwa told us that Israeli officials confiscated much of what they'd been given -  nine of their 12 cans were taken. \"They told us, 'It is forbidden to take more than these cans,'\" said Siwar's mother, Najwa Ashour. \"Even though it is therapeutic milk and they said that treatment is allowed, yet they took them.\"She also said that extra clothing the family had been given in Jordan was taken. \"They searched us from top to bottom. When they saw us wearing clothes over each other [layered] they refused to let us out, and told us, 'You must take off all the clothes, down to one outfit.'\"I asked the Israeli government why the milk formula and clothing were confiscated? They replied that limits were placed on what could be taken back for \"security considerations.\"They said only minimal luggage was allowed and this had been conveyed to the Jordanian authorities and the returning families. \"In cases where the luggage exceeded the approved scope, its entry was denied.\"The WHO has appealed for more countries to offer medical evacuation to patients who cannot get the necessary treatment in Gaza.It has also called on the Israeli government to allow patients to be treated in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank \"which is the most time and cost effective route.\" Israel stopped allowing such evacuations after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.Cogat, the Israeli military bosy in charge of aid, said the process for Gazan residents' departure to third countries had been substantially eased.Siwar's family has been given Neocate milk formula since returning to Gaza. There have also been donations of money, including funds raised from online appeals. Jordanian representatives in Gaza have also visited the family to provide assistance.The Ashours are trying to have Siwar evacuated once more - a process that has begun with the issuing of a permit by Palestinian health officials. It will be managed by the WHO which deals with all evacuation requests from a place the UN calls \"a wasteland\". With additional reporting by Malak Hassouneh, Suha Kawar and Alice Doyard.",

    "body": "Three French teens drown after car crashes upside down in swimming pool12 hours agoLaura GozziAFPFirefighters were called several hours after the accident to remove the car from the pool (file pic)Three teenagers were killed when their car skidded off the road in southern France, went through a wall and crashed upside down in a private pool, trapping them inside. The vehicle was a similar size to the pool and the teenagers - aged 14, 15 and 19 - were unable to open the doors and drowned.The freak accident occurred in the town of Alès in the early hours of Wednesday. \"It's truly the height of horror,\" said public prosecutor Abdelkrim Grini. \"It wasn't the impact of the accident that killed them. They found themselves upside down in icy water, unable to get out. They had no chance.\" Unconfirmed reports suggest the youngest of the three victims was at the wheel of the car at the time.The accident, which happened during a night of heavy rain, was the result of an \"unbelievable series of circumstances,\" the prosecutor told AFP news agency.The prosecutor described how the car had smashed through a low-level garden wall, flipped over and landed \"with all four wheels in the air\".It was not for several hours that the alarm was raised and firefighters were called to drain the pool and remove the vehicle. BFMTV reported that the pool was about 1.5m (5ft) deep.A mangled car was pulled on to a firefighters' truck during the morning and video from the scene showed the private swimming pool next to the collapsed wall. Canisters of nitrous oxide were found in the car, according to French reports. The substance is used by recreational users as it can make people feel relaxed, light-headed or dizzy.An investigation has been opened into the cause of death. The three victims' bodies  have been taken to the forensic institute in Nîmes for post mortem examinations, AFP said.",

    "body": "The search for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will resume on 30 December, over a decade after the aircraft with 239 people on board vanished, Malaysian authorities have said.This fresh search, which will run for 55 days, had begun in March but was suspended shortly after because of poor weather conditions.\"The latest development underscores the [Malaysia's] commitment to providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy,\" the transport ministry said on Wednesday, according to local media.Flight MH370, a Boeing 777, disappeared in 2014 while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and sparked the largest search in aviation history.Exploration firm Ocean Infinity is leading the current search under a \"no find, no fee\" arrangement. It will receive $70m (£56m) if the wreckage is found, Transport Minister Loke Siew Fook earlier said.Previous attempts include a multinational search involving 60 ships and 50 aircraft from 26 countries, which ended in 2017, and a 2018 effort by Ocean Infinity ended after three months.Flight MH370 lost contact with air traffic control less than an hour after take-off on 8 March 2014, and radar showed it had deviated from its original flight path.It remains one of the greatest aviation mysteries, which continues to haunt the families of those on board. Over the years, many had called for a new search, noting their struggle to find closure.The incident has also given rise to a host of conspiracy theories, including speculation that the pilot had deliberately brought the plane down or that it had been hijacked.An investigation in 2018 found that the plane's controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course, but drew no conclusions behind it.Investigators said at the time that \"the answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found\".",

Officer Martin said the animal had fallen through one of the ceiling tiles before going \"on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything\". Only one blurry CCTV image of the boozy break-in exists, so it's unknown just how much alcohol the thirsty creature consumed before passing out in the bathroom.In a social media post, the store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter for its professionalism and providing its visitor with a \"sober ride home\".Officer Martin said it was \"just another day in the life of an animal control officer\".

    "body": "The EU's former foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has been accused of fraud as part of an EU investigation into the misuse of funds, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) has said.The EPPO said searches were carried out on Tuesday at the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, headed by Ms Mogherini, as well as the European External Action Service (EEAS) in Brussels - the office she ran for five years as the bloc's top diplomat.The investigation relates to EU-funded training for junior diplomats, the EPPO said. As well as Ms Mogherini, a senior College of Europe staff member and a senior official from the European Commission were detained, the prosecutor's office added.According to the EPPO, the three were formally told of the allegations against them: \"the accusations concern procurement fraud and corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy.\"They were all subsequently released as they were not considered a flight risk and their homes were also searched.Under Belgian law, a person can be arrested then released without being charged, while remaining a suspect.The EPPO said the investigation focused on a tender that the EEAS awarded to the College of Europe in 2021-2022. It added that there were \"strong suspicions\" of favouritism related to the tender for  a nine-month training course for junior diplomats.The EPPO, which investigates alleged crimes against the financial interests of the EU, has not released the names of the individuals held, but said the immunity of several suspects had been lifted as part of this investigation.The College of Europe is an independent school attended by aspiring EU civil servants. It is closely associated with and partly funded by the EU. ",

    "body": "8 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterGetty ImagesCongressman Henry Cuellar was criminally charged last year US President Donald Trump has said he will pardon Democratic congressman Henry Cuellar, who was charged last year with accepting around $600,000 (£478,000) in bribes. On social media, Trump said he would issue a \"full and unconditional\" pardon of the Texas representative and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, who was also charged in the case.\"Henry, I don't know you, but you can sleep well tonight - Your nightmare is finally over!\" the president, a Republican, wrote. He added that he thought Cuellar was charged by former President Joe Biden because he \"bravely spoke out against Open Borders\". Cuellar and his wife, who posted bail after they were charged, maintain their innocence. On Wednesday morning Cuellar filed for re-election as a Democrat, scotching speculation that he might be poised to switch parties and pad the Republicans' narrow majority in the House.Biden's Department of Justice had alleged that Cuellar, who has been representing Texas' 28th congressional district since 2005, illicitly received money from an Azerbaijani government-owned oil company and a Mexican bank.The indictment alleged that, in exchange for the money, Cuellar agreed to influence US foreign policy in favour of Azerbaijan - and to advocate for measures that would benefit the Mexico City bank.Companies owned by Imelda Cuellar allegedly laundered the money, which the family used to pay off debts and make purchases.Among them was $58,000 (£46,000) in credit card payments, $18,000 at wholesale stores and $12,000 for a custom gown, the indictment said.The couple faced charges of conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud, money laundering and violating a ban on acting as agents of a foreign organisation.Though he's a Democrat, Cuellar's politics sit to the right of many members of his party. He's been called the \"last pro-life Democrat\" for his moderate stance on abortion. \"My faith is clear: abortion must be rare and safe,\" he has said in the past. In a letter to Trump, Cuellar's daughters also said they believe their father's stance on immigration may have led to his arrest. They wrote that their father believed in \"securing the border\" and that his \"independence and honesty\" may have been the reason behind his indictment. Trump seemed to agree, saying on Truth Social that Biden \"went after the Congressman, and even the Congressman's wonderful wife, Imelda, simply for speaking the TRUTH\".This is Trump's third act of clemency this week. He pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine to the US, and of possessing machine guns.On Monday, Trump also commuted the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was just days into a seven-year prison sentence for fraud.So far in his second term, the president has pardoned or commuted the sentences of multiple people convicted of various types of fraud or financial crimes.

    "body": "India has scrapped an order making it mandatory for smartphone makers to  preload a state-run cyber safety app on new phones after a public furore. The order gave smartphone makers 90 days to pre-load new phones with its new Sanchar Saathi app which could not be \"disabled or restricted\", sparking privacy and surveillance concerns. The government argued the move was necessary to verify the authenticity of handsets, but cybersecurity experts said it impinged on citizens' right to privacy.Withdrawing the order on Wednesday, the government cited the app's \"increasing acceptance\". It came after Apple and Samsung had reportedly resisted the directive to pre-install it on their devices.So far 14 million users have downloaded the app, reporting 2,000 frauds daily, and on Tuesday alone 600,000 new users registered - a tenfold spike, according to India's telecom ministry.But the order - passed last week but made public on Monday - to make the registration mandatory had led to a major backlash from several cybersecurity experts. Smartphone giants like Apple and Samsung also resisted the directive to pre-install the app on their phones. Sources told the BBC the companies were concerned the directive was issued without prior consultation and challenged user privacy norms. While the order has now been withdrawn, India's Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia dismissed concerns that the app could be used to increase surveillance.\"Snooping is neither possible nor will it happen with the Sanchar Saathi safety app,\" Scindia said. The government's decision to reverse the order was welcomed by digital advocacy groups. \"This is a welcome development, but we are still awaiting the full text of the legal order that should accompany this announcement, including any revised directions under the Cyber Security Rules, 2024,\" the Internet Freedom Foundation said on X. \"For now, we should treat this as cautious optimism, not closure, until the formal legal direction is published and independently confirmed.\" Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "Watch: Australia's social media ban explained... in 60 secondsYouTube says Australia's \"rushed\" new laws to block teens from its platform will mean children will be less safe as its \"robust parental controls\" will be stripped away.Parents will \"lose their ability to supervise their teen or tween's account\" such as content settings or blocking channels from 10 December when a social media ban for under-16s starts. Children will still be able to view videos but without an account.Communications Minister Anika Wells responded by saying it was \"outright weird\" that YouTube was highlighting the dangers of its platform for children.\"If YouTube is reminding us all that it is not safe ... that's a problem that YouTube needs to fix,\" Wells said on Wednesday.The platform's statement comes as Australia's internet regulator sets her sights on two little-known apps that teens have flocked to in the lead-up to the country's social media ban.Lemon8, owned by the creators behind TikTok, and Yope are video and photo-sharing apps that have seen a rise in downloads recently, prompting eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant to ask them to self-assess if they fall under the ban.The government reversed an exemption for YouTube from the ban in July, with the eSafety Commissioner saying it was \"the most frequently cited platform\" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw \"harmful content\".In a statement on Wednesday, the video-sharing platform said it would comply but that the new law undermined more than a decade's work in  building \"robust protections and parental controls that families rely on for a safer YouTube experience\".\"Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,\" wrote Rachel Lord, public policy senior manager at Google and YouTube Australia, adding that parents and educators shared these concerns.She labelled the ban - which comes under the Social Media Minimum Age Act - as \"rushed regulation that misunderstands our platform and the way young Australians use it\".From 10 December, anyone under 16 will be automatically signed out of their YouTube account, meaning they cannot upload content or post comments. YouTube Kids is not part of the ban. In addition, default wellbeing settings such as reminders to take a break or go to bed will no longer be available to children as they only work for account holders. Ms Lord said the legislation had \"failed to allow for adequate consultation and consideration of the real complexities of online safety regulation.\" YouTube's parent company, Google, has reportedly considered launching a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion in the ban. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.In a speech on Wednesday, exactly a week before the ban kicks in, Wells said teething problems were expected in the first few days and weeks.\"Regulation, and cultural change, takes time. Takes patience,\" she said.Wells said Gen Alpha - anyone under 15 years - were connected to a \"dopamine drip\" from the moment they got a smartphone and social media accounts.Previous generations had dealt with bullying or potentially harmful content but it was limited, she said. New technology meant children today had \"constant access\" with algorithms and notifications \"stealing their attention for hours every day\".\"With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine.\"Tech companies will have to provide regular six-monthly reports on how many accounts they have for under-16s, she said.Under the ban, tech companies can be fined up to A$49.5m (US$33m, £25m) if they don't comply with the age restrictions. They will need to deactivate existing accounts and prohibit any new accounts, as well as stopping any work arounds.The other platforms that fall under the ban are Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, X, Twitch, Threads, Reddit and Kick.

    "body": "9 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorWhat does the latest round of diplomacy on Ukraine tell us about Russian President Vladimir Putin's mood and intentions?For starters, that he's not ready to sign a peace deal. At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "18 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPrada announced on Tuesday that it has acquired Versace, bringing two major Italian luxury fashion houses under one roof.The $1.38bn (£1.04bn) deal is well below the roughly $2bn that Versace's former parent company, Capri Holdings, paid for the brand in 2018.The acquisition expands Prada's portfolio of designer brands - including Miu Miu - as it seeks to compete with rivals including French conglomerate LVMH, which owns Dior and Fendi in addition to Louis Vuitton.Storied designer Donatella Versace stepped down as the brand's creative chief in March after 27 years at the fashion company, known for its glamorous styles and the iconic Medusa head logo. She took over the company in 1997, after the murder of her brother Gianni. She was replaced by Dario Vitale, formerly a design director of Miu Miu, Prada's youth-focused luxury brand.The company is being sold at a roughly $700m loss after Versace's sales slowed, along with the sale of Capri Holdings' other brands, which include Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.During Capri Holdings' ownership, Versace shifted from its recognisable ornate designs to embrace a more minimalist trend – while hiking prices.Prada said in a one-line statement on Tuesday that it has successfully completed the acquisition of Versace, having received all required regulatory clearances.Proceeds from the sale will help cut debt for Capri Holdings, Versace's former parent company, the firm said. Capri chief executive John D Idol said: \"We plan to use the proceeds to repay the majority of our debt, which will substantially strengthen our balance sheet.\"Andrea Guerra, the chief executive of Prada, said earlier this year that Versace has \"huge potential\".\"The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience,\" he said.

    "body": "A New Zealand man has been charged for theft after he allegedly stole a diamond-studded locket in a rather unusual way - by swallowing it. The ingested loot - a Fabergé egg locket valued at NZ$33,585 ($19,300; £14,600) - has not yet been recovered, police told local media outlets.Police were called to Partridge Jewellers in central Auckland last Friday afternoon and the 32-year-old man was arrested in store minutes later.  He has undergone a medical assessment and remains in custody, police say. The allegedly stolen Fabergé egg is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, according to the jeweller's website, and opens to reveal an 18-carat gold miniature octopus.The Octopussy egg, as it is named, was inspired by the 1983 James Bond film of the same name, which centres on an elaborate Fabergé egg heist.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.The suspect is due to appear in court again on 8 December.According to reports, he has also been charged with allegedly stealing an iPad from the same jewellery store on 12 November and making away with cat litter and flea control products worth NZ$100 from a private address a day after.",

    "body": "Cyclone catastrophe in Sri Lanka awakens volunteer spirit1 day agoIshara Danasekara,News Editor, BBC News SinhalaandKoh EweWatch: Sri Lankan communities under water after catastrophic floodingSri Lankan actor and musician GK Reginold rides a motorised fishing boat through Colombo's suburbs, hoping to bring food and water to those in desperate need.Some of the families, Mr Reginold says, have not received aid for days, isolated by the South Asian island nation's worst weather disaster in recent years.Cyclone Ditwah lashed the country last week, bringing catastrophic floods and landslides that killed more than 460 people, left hundreds missing and damaged some 30,000 homes.But the deluge has also inspired volunteerism among its people, as they face what their president has described as the \"most challenging natural disaster\" in its history.\"The main reason why I wanted to do this, is to at least help them to have one meal,\" Mr Reginold tells the BBC. \"And I was so happy that I was able to do that.\"BBC SinhalaVolunteers have been taking fishing boats out to rescue flood victims and deliver aidMore than one million people have been affected by the disaster and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency.Sri Lanka's military has deployed helicopters for rescue operations, while humanitarian aid is flowing in from foreign governments and non-governmental organisations.But it will be a long journey to recovery for Sri Lanka, which has seen its fair share of turmoil in recent years.Activists volunteer in community kitchenIn Colombo's Wijerama neighbourhood, activists who protested against former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 are now helping run a community kitchen that churns out food aid.The protests from three years ago were fuelled by a spiralling economic crisis that caused shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

    "body": "Israel has announced it will open the key Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt in the coming days to allow Palestinians to leave the territory.Israeli military body Cogat said exits would be \"facilitated through co-ordination with Egypt, following security approval by Israel and under the supervision of the European Union mission\". It added that this would be \"similar to the mechanism that operated in January\", when the crossing opened during a previous ceasefire.An Israeli security official said it was an expression of Israel's support for the current ceasefire with Hamas, which began seven weeks ago.However, Egypt denied it was co-ordinating with Israel to reopen the Rafah crossing.The State Information Service cited an official Egyptian source as saying that \"if an agreement is reached to open the crossing, it will be in both directions, to enter and exit the Gaza Strip, in accordance with the plan of US President Donald Trump\".Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan states that \"opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism\" implemented under the January ceasefire deal.The crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. Before then, it was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the conflict and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. At least 16,500 severely ill or injured Palestinians in need of lifesaving medical treatment abroad are currently waiting to be evacuated from Gaza, according to the World Health Organization. It says only 235 patients, almost all of them children, have been evacuated via crossings with Israel since the ceasefire took effect.Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that Palestinian Authority (PA) forces would assist in operating the reopened Rafah crossing alongside the EU's Border Assistance Mission.It cited a European source as saying Palestinian representatives had also helped during the previous ceasefire but without wearing PA insignia due to \"Israeli sensitivity\" over their presence in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any role in the future governance of the territory for the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.Haaretz also reported that Netanyahu had so far blocked the reopening of the Rafah crossing because of the delayed return of the bodies of deceased hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza.Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian. In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.One of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli – Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is a Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.The Israeli prime minister's office said on Wednesday morning that forensic testing had shown that human remains handed over by Hamas in Gaza the previous day did not belong to either of the two men.On Wednesday afternoon, the military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, said it had recovered the body of a hostage in northern Gaza. The body will be transferred later to Israeli forces via the Red Cross, according to Hamas's military wing.The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Delhi records 200,000 acute respiratory illness cases amid toxic air18 hours agoAbhishek DeyDelhiGetty ImagesSome hospitals in Delhi now have clinics to treat pollution-related illnessesMore than 200,000 cases of acute respiratory illnesses were recorded in six state-run hospitals in Delhi between 2022 and 2024 as the Indian capital struggled with rising pollution levels, the federal government has said.The government said in parliament that more than 30,000 people with respiratory illnesses had to be hospitalised in these three years.Toxic air is a recurring problem in Delhi and its suburbs, especially during winters.For weeks now, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) - which measures different types of pollutants, including PM2.5, a fine particulate matter that can clog lungs - has been more than 20 times the limit recommended by the World Health Organization.There isn't a single cause behind the problem, but it's attributed to a mix of factors like industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, dropping temperatures, low wind speeds and the seasonal burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states.Delhi's six major hospitals recorded 67,054 acute respiratory cases in 2022, 69,293 in 2023 and 68,411 in 2024.\"Analysis suggests that increase in pollution levels was associated with increase in number of patients attending emergency rooms. However, this study design cannot provide confirmation that the association is causal,\" the government told parliament.Delhi's average AQI has crossed the \"severe\" 400 mark many times over the past decade, especially in winter -  levels that can harm even healthy people and pose serious risks to those with existing illnesses.On Wednesday morning, Delhi's average AQI was around 380, according to the government-backed Safar app.The BBC reported last week how many hospitals in Delhi and its suburbs are seeing an influx of children who are sick because of the toxic air.The Delhi high court is set to hear a petition on Wednesday calling for urgent measures to curb hazardous air pollution.Over the past few years, India's top court has also raised concerns about the air quality in Delhi and surrounding areas.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

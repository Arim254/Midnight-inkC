    "body": "3 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterREUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoFrank Gehry, one of the most influential architects of the last century, has died aged 96.Gehry was acclaimed for his avant garde, experimental style of architecture. His titanium-covered design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, catapulted him to fame in 1997. He built his daring reputation years before that when he redesigned his own home in Santa Monica, California, using materials like chain-link fencing, plywood and corrugated steel.HIs death was confirmed by his chief of staff Meaghan Lloyd. He is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Leslie and Brina; his wife, Berta Isabel Aguilera, and their two sons, Alejandro and Samuel, Getty ImagesThe Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, one of Gehry's most famous worksBorn in Toronto in 1929, Gehry moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to study architecture at the University of Southern California before completing further study at  the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1956 and 1957.After starting his own firm, he broke from the traditional architectural principles of symmetry, using unconventional geometric shapes and unfinished materials in a style now known as deconstructivism. \"I was rebelling against everything,\" Gehry said in an interview with The New York Times in 2012.His work in Bilbao put him in high demand, and he went on to design iconic structures in cities all over the world: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park, the Gehry Tower in Germany, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. \"He bestowed upon Paris and upon France his greatest masterpiece,\" said Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, the worlds largest luxury goods company which owns Louis Vuitton.With a largely unpredictable style, no two of his works look the same. Prague's Dancing House, finished in 1996, looks like a glass building folding in on itself; his Hotel Marques in Spain, built in 2006, features thin sheets of wavy, multicoloured metal; his design for a business school in Sydney looks like a brown paper bag.Gehry won the coveted Pritzker Architecture Prize for lifetime achievement in 1989, when he was 60, with his work described as having a \"highly refined, sophisticated and adventurous aesthetic\".\"His designs, if compared to American music, could best be likened to Jazz, replete with improvisation and a lively unpredictable spirit,\" ther Pritzker jury said at the time.Gehry was awarded the Order of Canada in 2002 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the US, in 2016.

    "body": "7 hours agoAnbarasan EthirajanGlobal affairs reporterGetty ImagesFile picture of a Royal Bengal tiger in Assam State ZooA woman accused of being one of the world's most wanted traffickers of tiger body parts has been arrested in India, officials have said. Yangchen Lachungpa, who was detained earlier this week, is accused of playing a critical role in building trafficking corridors leading out of the country to smuggle  tiger parts out of the country. Lachungpa had been on Interpol's most-wanted list, and her bail plea was rejected during a court appearance on Thursday. Wildlife officials said that Ms Yangchen's arrest was a major breakthrough in the battle against poaching in India. It is rare for a woman to be arrested in connection with the illegal trade of animal body parts. Police had been looking for Lachungpa for several years. She was arrested following a co-ordinated operation between the Madhya Pradesh State Tiger Strike Force and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, the environment ministry said on Friday.  It added that Lachungpa was a key member of an organised trafficking network which has links to Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan, as well having operations in several Indian cities including Delhi.Lachungpa had been arrested in 2017but disappeared after being granted bail.Another man accused at the time, Jai Tamang, and who was arrested in 2015, told police that he had given Lachungpa wildlife contraband in exchange for shelter. Tiger parts are in demand in China where they have been used in traditional medicine.The International Fund for Animal Welfare says that there were 26 documented cases of tiger poaching in 2024, with 56 cases the proceeding year. But it adds that there were likely \"many more\" tigers were likely poached as many are found dead without evidence of poaching. ",

    "body": "The man accused of assassinating former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has apologised to the ex-leader's family for the first time.Tetsuya Yamagami, who earlier pleaded guilty to murder, told the court on Thursday that he felt \"deeply sorry\" towards Abe's widow, Akie.Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. He died in the hospital on the same day.Abe's death sent shockwaves around the world. He was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\".\"I have caused [the family] three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse,\" Yamagami told the court on Thursday, according to local media.He reportedly told investigators he attacked Abe because he blamed the ex-prime minister for allegedly promoting the Unification Church, which Yamagami said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.Yamagami's allegations prompted investigations into the Unification Church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings.In March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the church to disband - a ruling that the church said it would \"fight to the end\".The Unification Church has drawn controversy even before Abe's assassination, for teaching that marriage is central to spiritual salvation.Abe's grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was also Japan's prime minister, was known to have been close to the Unification Church because of its anti-communist nature. Abe himself had spoken at events related to the group.During a hearing last month, prosecutors read out a statement from Abe's widow in which she wrote: \"The sorrow of losing a husband will not be relieved.\"",

    "body": "India's travel chaos has worsened after the country's largest airline IndiGo cancelled hundreds of scheduled flights on Friday after three days of widespread disruption across its network.The carrier, which has a 60% market share in India and flies more than 2,000 flights a day, has been facing pilot shortages after it failed to adapt to new crew rostering rules.Thousands of passengers are stranded across India in what's a busy travel season, with all IndiGo flights from the capital Delhi cancelled.IndiGo has said operations will return to full normalcy only by 10 February, and has sought temporary relief on the new rules that call for more rest hours and restricted night-duty.The airline has also said it will reduce its flight operations to minimise disruptions from 8 December. The government has said it is closely monitoring the situation with the federal aviation minister expressing \"clear displeasure\" with how the airline had handled the situation. In a separate statement, India's aviation regulator said the disruptions were primarily on account of \"misjudgment and planning gaps\" in implementing the new flight duty time limitation rules. The regulator has directed IndiGo to submit a detailed plan on crew recruitment,  training, roster restructuring, safety-risk assessments and other mitigation measures with immediate effect.Local media reports say IndiGo has been granted a waiver from the new pilot rest rules, and the ban on combining pilot leave with weekly rest has been eased to stabilise operations. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this.But the airline has attracted sharp criticism from the Airline Pilots Association of India, which said any relief granted to the airline on duty timings undermines the spirit of the new regulations and \"gravely\" compromises the safety of the flying public. Under the new rules pilots are given more rest, with one of the major changes mandating pilots to make two night-time landings per week, down from six under the old rules.December is a busy travel month in India, when school holidays and the peak wedding season gets under way. IndiGo has said it will waive off all cancellation/reschedule requests for travel between 5 and 15 December. It is also arranging for hotel rooms and food for passengers whose travel has been disrupted. But several passengers have taken to social media, expressing anger about not being given up-to-date information and remaining stranded at the airport without food. Singapore's High Commissioner to India Simon Wong said he was \"lost for words\" as he joined the thousands stranded at the airport, having to miss the wedding of his young staff member. Major airports in Delhi, Mumbai and other cities have issued advisories asking passengers to check the status of their flights before heading to the airport. ",

The alert reached people nearly 200 miles away in the San Francisco Bay Area, triggering automatic warnings advising residents to drop for cover.However, the agency then cancelled the alert minutes later and removed the corresponding entry from its website.\"There was no M5.9 earthquake near Carson City, NV,\" the USGS said on X.The USGS said the alert originated from its automatic earthquake detection system, which had erroneously generated the report. It said it was believed to be the first time the agency has issued a completely false earthquake notification.An investigation is under way to determine what caused the malfunction.Multiple law enforcement agencies in cities and counties near the reported epicentre confirmed the absence of any ground movement.A magnitude 5.9 earthquake is typically strong enough to cause noticeable shaking and slight property damage, according to the Michigan Tech Earthquake Magnitude Scale.",

    "body": "12 hours agoVikas Pandey,DelhiandRuth ComerfordRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide \"uninterrupted shipments\" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil.Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow.President Donald Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on most Indian products, arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies.Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a \"peaceful solution\" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas or Russia would seize it.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on \"the side of peace\", welcoming efforts to find a \"lasting\" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the \"connectivity\" of Russia and India was a \"major priority\" for India.In recent months, India-US ties have hit an all-time low as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable\" at the time.  In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US.\"The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,\" he asked.Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, Bloomberg reported in September - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May.  The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture.Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia.Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said.No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals.India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry.Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years.Modi said that \"energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership\", but made no specific reference to oil.India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions.Putin also referenced a \"flagship project\": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with.In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being \"reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms\".Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a \"more just\" and \"multi-polar\" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBrandon Drenon,Washington DC andMadeline HalpertThe US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on whether some children born in the US have a constitutional right to citizenship.On his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump signed an order to end birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are in the country illegally, but the move was blocked by multiple lower courts.No date has been set yet for the Supreme Court arguments, and a ruling is months away.Whatever the court decides could have major implications for Trump's immigration crackdown and for what it means to be an American citizen.For nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces.The language of the amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"Trump's executive order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or are in the country on temporary visas. It is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reform the nation's immigration system and combat what they have called \"significant threats to national security and public safety\".The administration has argued the 14th Amendment clause \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the amendment excludes children of people who are not in the country permanently or lawfully.Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, told the BBC's news partner CBS that no president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,\"  Ms Wang said in a statement. \"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term,\" she added.The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.After legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal  court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.Trump then went to the Supreme Court to fight the injunctions. In a win for Trump, the court ruled in June that the injunctions issued by the lower courts exceeded their authority, though it did not address the issue of birthright citizenship itself. The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.US Solicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the amendment was adopted \"to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens\".He has said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on US soil confers citizenship and has argued that that understanding has had \"destructive consequences\"About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2016 - a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007, according to The Pew Research Center.By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.A study published in May by the thinktank Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University's Population Research Institute suggested that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the size of the unauthorized population in the US by an additional 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.",

    "body": "A prominent Palestinian militia leader in Gaza who opposed Hamas has been killed.Yasser Abu Shabab headed the so-called Popular Forces group, which has dozens of fighters and operates in Israeli-controlled territory near the southern city of Rafah.The Popular Forces said in a statement that Abu Shabab was shot while \"attempting to resolve a dispute\" between members of the Abu Seneima family. It dismissed as \"misleading\" reports that he was killed by Hamas, which had accused him of collaborating with Israel.An earlier statement from Abu Shabab's Bedouin tribe, the Tarabin, said he had been killed \"at the hands of the resistance\", and accused him of betraying the Palestinian people.Other sources said his death was the result of an internal power struggle.A Hamas statement said the \"fate that befell\" Abu Shabab was \"the inevitable fate of all who betray their people and homeland and are content to be tools in the hands of the occupation [Israel]\", without claiming involvement in his killing.Israel's Army Radio cited a security source as saying that Abu Shabab had died of his wounds after being evacuated to Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. But the hospital denied that he died under their care.The statement from the Popular Forces pledged to continue on Abu Shabab's \"path until the last terrorist is eliminated from the soil of Gaza and a bright and secure future is built for our people, who believe in peace\".In June, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming Palestinian clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas.It came after Israeli media reported that he had authorised the supply of weapons to the Popular Forces. However, the militia denied that it was being armed by Israel.The Popular Forces have been accused of looting humanitarian aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, which the militia has also denied. Reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began almost eight weeks ago, Abu Shabab had reportedly been one of several anti-Hamas militia leaders jostling for position in the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.It would involve setting up an interim government, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.Under the first phase, Hamas agreed to return all 48 living and dead hostages it was still holding in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, as well as a partial Israeli withdrawal and a surge in humanitarian aid.The body of one dead Israeli hostage is yet to be returned.Israel's government has previously said it would not join talks on the second phase until Hamas has returned all the hostages. However, Trump said on Wednesday that the second phase was \"going to happen pretty soon\".The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,120 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Cyclone catastrophe in Sri Lanka awakens volunteer spirit3 days agoIshara Danasekara,News Editor, BBC News SinhalaandKoh EweWatch: Sri Lankan communities under water after catastrophic floodingSri Lankan actor and musician GK Reginold rides a motorised fishing boat through Colombo's suburbs, hoping to bring food and water to those in desperate need.Some of the families, Mr Reginold says, have not received aid for days, isolated by the South Asian island nation's worst weather disaster in recent years.Cyclone Ditwah lashed the country last week, bringing catastrophic floods and landslides that killed more than 460 people, left hundreds missing and damaged some 30,000 homes.But the deluge has also inspired volunteerism among its people, as they face what their president has described as the \"most challenging natural disaster\" in its history.\"The main reason why I wanted to do this, is to at least help them to have one meal,\" Mr Reginold tells the BBC. \"And I was so happy that I was able to do that.\"BBC SinhalaVolunteers have been taking fishing boats out to rescue flood victims and deliver aidMore than one million people have been affected by the disaster and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency.Sri Lanka's military has deployed helicopters for rescue operations, while humanitarian aid is flowing in from foreign governments and non-governmental organisations.But it will be a long journey to recovery for Sri Lanka, which has seen its fair share of turmoil in recent years.Activists volunteer in community kitchenIn Colombo's Wijerama neighbourhood, activists who protested against former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 are now helping run a community kitchen that churns out food aid.The protests from three years ago were fuelled by a spiralling economic crisis that caused shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

    "body": "Kenya has signed a historic five-year health agreement with the US, the first such pact since Donald Trump's administration overhauled its foreign aid programme.The $2.5bn (£1.9bn) deal is aimed at combating infectious diseases in Kenya, with similar agreements expected to be rolled out in other African countries aligned with Trump's broader foreign policy goals.The government-to-government deal aims to boost transparency and accountability but has raised fears it could give the US real-time access to critical health databases, including sensitive patient information.Kenya's Health Minister Aden Duale sought to allay such fears, saying \"only de-identified, aggregated data\" would be shared.On his first day in office in January, Trump announced a freeze on foreign aid as part of a government spending review, dismantled the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and cut billions in aid to poorer countries. This has led to a drastic reduction in the availability of some drugs in developing countries.In September, the Trump administration introduced an \"America First Global Health Strategy\", making aid dependent on negotiations that officials said would cut waste and advance US priorities.Under the deal with Kenya, the US will contribute $1.7bn, with the Kenyan government covering $850m and gradually taking on more responsibility.The deal targets the prevention and treatment of HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis, maternal care, polio eradication and infectious disease outbreak response and preparedness.Signing the agreement with Kenya's President William Ruto, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described it as a \"landmark agreement,\" and referred to Kenya as a \"longstanding American ally\".He praised Kenya for its role in leading and contributing to the UN-backed mission working to combat powerful gangs in Haiti.\"If we had five or 10 countries willing to step forward and do just half of what Kenya has done already, it would be an extraordinary achievement,\" said Rubio. The secretary of state explained that the US wanted its foreign aid to go directly to governments, rather than through aid agencies and charities.\"We are not going to spend billions of dollars funding the NGO industrial complex while close and important partners like Kenya either have no role to play or have very little influence over how health care money is being spent,\" he said.Kenya's president said the money would be used to work towards the country's priorities, such as buying modern equipment for hospitals and boosting the health workforce.\"I assure you that every shilling and every dollar will be spent efficiently, effectively, and accountably,\" Ruto added. However, some Kenyans are demanding the disclosure of the full agreement, with fears that it would allow the US to view personal medical records such as the HIV status, TB treatment history, and vaccination data of Kenyan patients. \"What specific data categories are being shared? Are genomic data, disease patterns, mental health data, insurance claims, hospital records, or biometrics included? If not, why is that not explicitly written?\" lawyer Willis Otieno posted on X. Well-known whistle-blower Nelson Amenya voiced similar concerns, urging the Kenyan government to release the full agreement so \"we can read it for ourselves\".Minister Duale has dismissed such fears, insisting that Kenya's health data remained secure and fully protected by Kenyan laws.\"Your health data is a national strategic asset,\" Duale added. US officials are yet to comment on the data concerns.A number of other African countries are expected to sign similar agreements by the end of the year, according to US officials. ",

    "body": "Olympian and other Eritreans freed after 18 years without trial, relatives tell the BBC11 hours agoTeklemariam BekitEditor, BBC TigrinyaThirteen people held for more than 18 years without trial in Eritrea have been released from a notorious military prison, relatives of the detainees have told the BBC.Among those freed were several prominent figures, including 69-year-old Olympian cyclist and businessman Zeragaber Gebrehiwot.They had been held at Mai Serwa prison, known for its harsh conditions and where many of the inmates are believed to be political prisoners.An unnamed source who was once detained in Mai Serwa told the BBC the prisoners were arrested in October 2007 following an assassination attempt on Col Simon Gebredingil, a senior internal security officer in President Isaias Afwerki's government.Around 30 people were initially detained, according to the source. Some have been released over the years, but about 20 remained in custody.Zeragaber competed in the Moscow Olympics in 1980 when Eritrea was part of Ethiopia.The mountainous country, which gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has a strong cycling culture and its cyclists have steadily gained international recognition over the past decade.Those released with Zeragaber on Thursday include prominent businessmen Tesfalem Mengsteab and Bekure Mebrahtu as well as the Habtemariam brothers - David, an engineer, and Matthews, a geometrist.Six senior police officers and an internal security agent were also freed.The Eritrean government has not issued any statement regarding the releases.Many of them are sick and this could explain why they have been released now.Families were not allowed to visit the prisoners throughout their detention, the relatives said.The UN and human rights groups have long accused the Eritrean government of gross human rights violations, including torture, forced disappearance and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of people in inhumane conditions.Mai Serwa prison, located about 9km (six miles) north-west of the capital, Asmara, has expanded over the years to include 20 metal shipping containers in which prisoners are held incommunicado, sources have told the BBC.Last year, Berhane Abrehe, who served as President Isaias's finance minister for 11 years until 2012, died in prison. He had spent six years in jail - detained after releasing a book in which he described the president as a \"dictator\" who needed to resign.He was also never taken to court. According to UK-based Human Rights Concern - Eritrea, he died in Asmara's Carshelli prison.Over the last three decades, Eritrea has remained a one-party state with no functioning constitution. It is one of the most militarised societies in the world, with indefinite military conscription.There has been no free press since the closure of independent newspapers and arrest of most of their editors and journalists in 2001.This was when the government arrested 15 politicians known as the G-15, along with 16 journalists, after they demanded that President Isaias implement the draft constitution and hold open elections.According to Amnesty International, the fate and whereabouts of 11 of the politicians, as well as the journalists accused of links to the G-15, remain unknown.Aged 79, President Isaias marked 32 years in power earlier this year and has still never faced an election.",

    "body": "Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has voted to introduce voluntary military service, in a move aimed at boosting national defences after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It marks a significant shift in Germany's approach to its military and follows Chancellor Friedrich Merz's push to create Europe's strongest conventional army.The change means that all 18-year-olds in Germany will be sent a questionnaire from January 2026 asking if they are interested and willing to join the armed forces. The form will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.Students at schools across Germany have said they will join strikes in as many as 90  cities on Friday to protest against the move.Many young Germans either oppose the new law or are sceptical.\"We don't want to spend half a year of our lives locked up in barracks, being trained in drill and obedience and learning to kill,\" the organisers of the protests wrote in a statement posted on social media.\"War offers no prospects for the future and destroys our livelihoods.\"In Hamburg alone, about 1,500 people were expected to join the protests, and school head teachers warned parents not to take their children out of school for the day.German MPs voted by 323 votes to 272 to back the change, making their country the latest European country to launch some form of revised military service. Last month, France said it was introducing 10 months of voluntary military training for 18- and 19-year-olds.The government says military service will be voluntary for as long as possible, but from July 2027, all 18-year-old men will have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for possible military service.Universal medical examinations were necessary, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said, so that in the event of an attack, Germany would not waste time determining \"who is operationally capable as a homeland protector and who is not\".Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, currently have around 182,000 service personnel, and Pistorius wants to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year.The long-term aim is to raise the number by the early 2030s to 260,000, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists, to meet new Nato force targets and strengthen Germany's defences.While the plan is for voluntary service, if the security situation worsens or if too few volunteers came forward, a form of compulsory military service could be considered by the Bundestag.If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Like other European countries, Germany ran down its armed forces during the peacetime years of the 1990s. During the Cold War it had an army of almost half a million.Compulsory military service in Germany was ended in 2011 under former chancellor Angela Merkel.But now, in the face of perceived threats from Russia and heavy pressure from Germany's traditional ally, the US, Friedrich Merz has pledged to rebuild the Bundeswehr into Europe's strongest conventional army.Nato countries have come under pressure from US President Donald Trump's White House to increase their spending on defence.Incentives for voluntary service are relatively high, with a promised salary of about €2,600 a month. In France, volunteers will be paid at least €800 (£700) a month.The Bundestag was also set to vote on Friday on a contentious pensions reform bill, which will keep the state pension at current levels until 2031.The bill is a key pillar of the coalition deal between Merz's conservatives and his centre-left partner, the Social Democrats, who have just a slender governing majority of just 12 votes.However, there had been doubts about whether it would pass the parliamentary vote, as  younger members of Merz's conservatives threatened to rebel. They say the plan is financially unsustainable and will leave younger generations shouldering the burden.But Germany's opposition far-left Left party said it would abstain from voting, which means the coalition needs fewer votes to pass it and so won't have to worry about potential rebels from its own ranks.A government crisis may narrowly have been averted.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesNetflix has agreed to buy the film and streaming businesses of Warner Bros Discovery for $72bn (£54bn) in a major Hollywood deal.The streaming giant emerged as the successful bidder for Warner Bros ahead of rivals Comcast and Paramount Skydance after a drawn-out battle.Warner Bros owns franchises including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, and the streaming service HBO Max.The takeover is set to create a new giant in the entertainment industry, but the deal will still have to be approved by competition authorities.Some in the film industry, including the Writers Guild of America, have criticised the deal, saying it would negatively impact workers and consumers.Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the streamer was \"highly confident\" it would receive the regulatory approval it needs and it was running \"full speed\" towards this. He said that by combining the library of Warner Bros shows and movies with the streaming platform's series such as Stranger Things, \"we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling\".\"Warner Bros have defined the last century of entertainment, and together we can define the next one,\" he said.Asked whether HBO should remain a separate streaming service, co-chief executive Greg Peters said Netflix believed the HBO brand was important for consumers, but added: \"We think it's quite early to get into the specifics of how we're going to tailor this offering for consumers.\"Netflix estimates it will find $2bn to $3bn in savings, mostly through eliminating overlaps in the support and technology areas of the businesses.Films made by Warner Bros will continue to be launched in cinemas, it said, and Warner Bros television studio will continue to be able to produce for third parties. Netflix will keep producing content exclusively for its own platform.Murray Close/Getty ImagesWarner Bros owns the rights to the Harry Potter filmsLabelling it a \"big day\" for the companies, Mr Sarandos acknowledged the acquisition may have surprised some shareholders but it was a \"rare opportunity\" to set Netflix up for success \"for decades to come\".David Zaslav, president and chief executive of Warner Bros, added the agreement would combine \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world\".\"By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come,\" he said.The cash and stock deal is worth $27.75 per Warner Bros share, with a total enterprise value - which includes the company's debts and the value of its shares - of about $82.7bn. The equity value, or cash price, is $72bn.The boards of directors from each company unanimously approved the deal.Some in the film industry have criticised the agreement.The Writers Guild of America's East and West branches issued a joint statement on Friday saying \"this merger must be blocked\".\"The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers,\" it said.  Michael O'Leary, chief executive of trade organisation Cinema United, said the merger posed \"an unprecedented threat\" to the global cinema business.\"The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,\" he said.Netflix will complete the takeover after Warner Bros finalises its previously announced plans to separate its streaming and studios division from its global networks division into two companies next year.Its global networks division will become Discovery Global and will include its cable channels such as CNN and TNT Sports in the US, as well as its Discovery and free-to-air channels in Europe. However, TNT Sports International will stay with the streaming and studios division being sold to Netflix.Hollywood shake-upPaolo Pescatore, founder and technology media and telecom analyst at PP Foresight, said the sale was \"a huge statement of intent and underlines Netflix aspirations to be a global leader in the new world order of streaming\".But he warned that while the \"surprising move\" made sense for Warner Bros, it could \"provide a headache for Netflix\" when trying to combine the companies given the size of the deal.While the agreed deal is for part of the Warner Bros business, rival Paramount had tabled a bid to buy the whole company, including its cable networks, in October. Warner Bros rejected this move before putting itself up for sale.Ahead of the announcement of the deal, Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the takeover would be approved by regulators, but if it went through it would have a massive impact on cinema.\"Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood,\" he said.Mr Harrington said there was likely to be \"big reductions\" in television and film output from a newly-merged company, which would lead to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant unions.For consumers, Mr Harrington said a merger was likely to lead to higher prices.\"Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be shuttered/become non-essential, the greater penetration of Netflix households would likely mean an increase in total overall subscription revenues.\"Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Netflix had \"offered an olive branch\" to Hollywood with the promise it would continue to release Warner Bros films on the big screen.\"If this deal can clear those significant regulatory hurdles quickly there are likely to be considerable cost savings to be made,\" she said. \"How much of those savings get passed to streaming platform subscribers or whether Netflix will be seen to have too much pricing power is one of the areas that will face a huge amount of scrutiny in the coming months.\"With additional reporting by Natalie Sherman",

    "body": "Deep-sea mining tests impact over a third of seabed animals - scientists17 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science correspondentNatural History Museum/ University of GothenburgA brittlestar found on the seafloor of the Clarion-Clipperton ZoneMachines mining minerals in the deep ocean have been found to cause significant damage to life on the seabed, scientists carrying out the largest study of its kind say.The number of animals found in the tracks of the vehicles was reduced by 37% compared to untouched areas, according to the scientists.The researchers discovered more than 4,000 animals, 90% of which were new species, living on the seafloor in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean.Vast amounts of critical minerals needed for green technologies could be locked in the deep ocean, but deep sea mining in international waters is very controversial and currently not permitted until more is known about the environmental impacts.Natural History Museum/ University of GothenburgThis sea urchin was one of the more than 4,000 creatures foundThe research by scientists at the Natural History Museum in London, the UK National Oceanography Centre and the University of Gothenburg was conducted at the request of deep sea mining company The Metals Company.The scientists said their work was independent and that the company was able to view the results before publication but was not allowed to alter them.The team compared biodiversity two years before and two months after the test mining that drove machines for 80km on the seafloor.They looked specifically at animals 0.3mm – 2cm in size, such as worms, sea spiders, snails and clams.In the tracks of the vehicle, the number of animals fell by 37% and the diversity of species by 32%.\"The machine removes about the top five centimetres of sediment. That's where most of the animals live. So obviously, if you're removing the sediment, you're removing the animals in it too,\" lead author Eva Stewart, PhD student at the Natural History Museum and the University of Southampton, told BBC News.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgThe scientists catalogued all the animals they found in the sediment, including this worm\"Even if they are not killed by the machine, pollution from the mining operations could slowly kill some less resilient species,\" said Dr Guadalupe Bribiesca-Contreras from the National Oceanography Centre.A few of the animals could have moved away, but \"whether or not they come back after disturbance is a different question\", she added.However, in the areas near the vehicle tracks, where clouds of sediment landed, the abundance of animals did not decrease.\"We were expecting possibly a bit more impact, but [we didn't] see much, just a shift in which species were dominant over others,\" Dr Adrian Glover, research scientist at the Natural History Museum, told BBC News.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgAn abyssal sea spider was another of macrofauna found during the research\"​We're ​encouraged ​by these ​data,\" a spokesperson for The Metals Company told BBC News.\"After ​years ​of ​activist ​alarm ​that ​our ​impacts ​would ​spread ​thousands ​of ​kilometers ​beyond ​the ​mine ​site, ​the ​data ​show ​that ​any ​biodiversity ​impacts ​are ​limited ​to ​the ​directly ​mined ​area,\" they added. But some experts do not think that this is good news for mining companies.\"I think the study shows that current technologies for harvesting are too damaging to permit large-scale commercial exploration,\" Dr Patrick Schröder, senior research fellow at the Environment and Society Centre at think tank Chatham House, told BBC News.\"These were only tests and the impact was significant. If they did that at large scale, it would be even more damaging,\" he added.Deep sea mining is controversial. At the heart of the debate is a difficult problem.The latest research took place in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a 6m sq km area of the Pacific Ocean estimated to hold over 21bn tonnes of nickel, cobalt and copper-rich polymetallic nodules.The world needs these critical minerals for renewable energy technologies to tackle climate change. They are essential components in solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles, for example.The International Energy Agency predicts that demand for the minerals could at least double by 2040.The minerals have to come from somewhere, but some scientists and environmental groups are gravely concerned that mining the deep seas could cause untold damage.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgAn abyssal sea star was also found during the researchSome fear that before we have the chance to explore the full nature of life in the undiscovered deep ocean, it could be endangered. Oceans play a critical role in regulating our planet and are already at severe risk from rising temperatures.The International Seabed Authority (ISA), which governs activity in international waters, has not yet approved commercial mining although it has issued 31 licences for exploration.A total of 37 countries, including the UK and France, are backing a temporary ban on mining.This week Norway postponed mining plans in its waters including the Arctic.But in April, US President Donald Trump called for domestic and international projects to be fast-tracked, as the US wants to secure the supply of minerals for use in weapons.If the ISA concludes that current mining techniques are too destructive, companies could try to develop less intrusive ways of extracting nodules from the seafloor.The research is published in the scientific journal Nature ​Ecology ​and ​Evolution.",

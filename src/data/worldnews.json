    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "A woman who raped and murdered 12 year-old Lola Daviet in Paris has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in a case that has shocked France. Dahbia Benkired, aged 27, must spend at least 30 years in prison after a panel of judges and a jury decided to impose the country's harshest possible penalty.A whole-life term is extremely rare in France and Benkired is the first woman to receive it.Those who have been given the sentence include serial killer and rapist Michel Fourniret and jihadist Salah Abdeslam, who took part in the 2015 Paris attacks which killed 130 people.Following the verdict, Lola's mother Delphine Daviet said: \"We believed in justice and we got it.\" Her brother Thibault, added: \"We have restored the memory of my sister, we have restored the truth.\"Warning: This story contains distressing detailsLola was murdered in October 2022. Her body was discovered in a plastic storage box in the courtyard of the building where she lived in north-eastern Paris. Benkired is an Algerian immigrant who was under orders to leave the country. French right-wing and far-right politicians have seized on the case.The prosecutor in trial had argued for Benkired to received the longest sentence possible. Benkired was examined by psychiatric experts and found to have \"psychopathic\" traits but otherwise sane.The prosecutor told a panel of three judges and six jurors: \"Make no mistake no drug treatment can fundamentally transform Ms Benkired's personality. When there is no illness, there is no treatment.\"Before jurors began their deliberations on Friday, Benkired told the court: \"I ask for forgiveness and what I did is horrible.\"That's all I have to say.\"CCTV footage from the afternoon of 14 October, 2022 showed Benkired, then 24 years-old, approaching Lola after she returned home from school.According to reports, Benkired lured Lola into an apartment her older sister was sub-letting in the building.   Over an hour-and-a-half, Benkired subjected the 12-year-old to a sexual assault before attacking her with scissors and a box cutter.Benkired bound Lola with duct tape, including around her head, leading to her death by asphyxiation.As he read out the verdict, the presiding judge referred to the \"extreme cruelty of the criminal acts\" which he described as \"true torture\".\"In determining the appropriate sentence, the court took into account the unspeakable psychological damage to the victim and her family in such violent and almost unspeakable circumstances,\" he said.Benkired was in France on a student visa but had failed to renew it. In July 2022, she was stopped at an airport in Paris and was given 30 days to leave the country. Days after Lola's murder in October that year, Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally party wrote on X that the woman \"had no business being in France\". Hard-right rival Éric Zemmour also took to social media to write: \"Lola's murderer should never have crossed her path.\"France's Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticised the \"indecency\" of politicians who, he said, \"should reflect on the consequences of their words\". Lola's mother and her father, Johan Daviet, denounced \"any use of the name and image of [our] child for political ends\".Mr Daviet died in 2024, aged 49.",

    "body": "9 hours agoRayhan DemytrieCaucasus correspondentGeorgia's former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili has appeared in court charged with large-scale money laundering - a shocking turnaround for one of the most loyal allies of billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, widely seen as Georgia's de facto leader.Prosecutors said when his home was raided by investigators earlier this month they discovered $6.5m (£4.9m) in cash.Garibashvili, 43, twice served as prime minister during the Ivanishvili years – first from 2013-15 and then again from 2021 until January last year.Now he has pleaded guilty to corruption charges that could carry a 12-year jail term and he has been granted bail of one million Georgian lari ($368,000; £277,000).The charges against the former prime minister are the latest in a string of detentions of ex-government officials.But the case against Garibashvili is the first prosecution of a senior member of Georgia's governing elite, and it comes amid the ruling party's authoritarian pivot away from the West.While serving first as defence minister and then as prime minister between 2019 and 2024, he is alleged to have \"secretly and covertly engaged in various types of business activities and received a particularly large amount of income of illegal origin\".He is accused of laundering this income and falsely declaring money as gifts from family members.His lawyer, Amiran Giguashvili, confirmed his client was working with authorities.\"The court took into account that Mr Irakli agrees to the charges, does not hide from the investigation and co-operates,\" he told the BBC.The corruption case marks a dramatic fall for a politician who worked in Ivanishvili's companies before entering politics in 2011 as part of the billionaire's Georgian Dream party, which has been in power since 2012.In February 2014, he signed Georgia's Association Agreement with the European Union.However, in recent years he has led Georgia's shift away from the EU. He developed close ties with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and said Nato's enlargement was one of the main reasons for the war in Ukraine.According to Georgian political analyst Ghia Nodia, the former prime minister's downfall reflects Bidzina Ivanishvili's mistrust of his former political appointees.\"Ivanishvili is really the driver, he decided for some reason that there is some kind of treason in his team,\" Nodia said.\"At this point, he trusts [current PM Irakli] Kobakhidze but stopped trusting his closest lieutenant, not just Garibashvili, but also [ex-security chief] Liluashvili and others.\"Meanwhile, Georgia's political turmoil continues, a year after Georgian Dream won contested parliamentary elections which the then president refused to recognise.There have been daily protests since the government's announcement in November 2024 that it would halt membership talks with the EU, and most opposition leaders are now in jail.New legislations have targeted civil society, pro-opposition media, and journalists and activists have been imprisoned.\"Ivanishvili seems like [he's] under siege,\" says Ghia Nodia. \"He believes these crazy deep state conspiracies that the West wants to destroy him through these continuous protests in Georgia.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoJack BurgessGetty ImagesEcuador's president has said someone attempted to poison him by putting three highly concentrated toxic substances in gifts of chocolate and jam.Daniel Noboa said his team had proof to support the claim, though he has yet to publicly provide any evidence.The South American leader told CNN on Thursday that he believed it was \"practically impossible\" that the three chemicals would be found in high concentrations in the items by chance.His comments come in the wake of violent clashes in Ecuador over a sharp rise in fuel prices under his presidency. The centre-right politician has brought in military crackdowns on drug gangs, but has also faced accusations of targeting protesters.Noboa has denied the allegations of attempts on his life - the third in two months - were a means of portraying his detractors as violent.\"No one throws a Molotov cocktail at themselves... or poisons themselves with chocolate, or throws stones at themselves,\" he said, referring to previous incidents.Early in October, Ecuador's government said five people were detained over what it described as an alleged assassination attempt.About 500 people threw rocks at the president's car and there were \"signs of bullet damage\" on his vehicle, according to the country's energy and environment minister, who added that Noboa was unharmed.The BBC was not able to independently confirm that a bullet had been fired.The government also said that, in late September, a humanitarian convoy containing Noboa was attacked and 17 soldiers taken hostage.Ecuadorian officials said the convoy - which included UN and EU diplomats - was delivering aid to communities affected by a national strike when ambushed by about 350 people, who attacked it with Molotov cocktails.Noboa posted photos of smashed windscreens and windows on the cars on social media.A national strike protesting against the government ending diesel subsidies came to a close on Thursday after several weeks.The strike was declared by the country's largest Indigenous organisation - the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) - with marches and roadblocks organised.The Conaie group led demonstrations that overthrew three presidents between 1997 and 2005.",

    "body": "The US has placed sanctions on Colombia's left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking. \"President Petro has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.Sanctions have also been imposed on Colombia's Interior Minister Armando Benedetti, as well as Petro's wife and eldest son. They include barring them from accessing assets and properties they may have in the US.Colombia was once a close ally of Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance. But Petro and Trump have clashed frequently since Trump's return to power.Bessent said that since Petro, a former guerrilla, came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\". He added that Trump was taking \"strong action\" and \"would not tolerate\" drug trafficking into the US. The Treasury said Colombia was the world's top exporter of cocaine, which it says poses a \"significant drug threat\" to the US.In a separate statement on Friday, the state department said it would will not certify Colombia's counter-narcotics efforts.Petro denied the accusations. In a post on X, he  said he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and had helped the US to reduce its cocaine consumption.\"A complete paradox - but not one step back, and never on our knees,\" he said. In recent weeks, the US military has ratcheted up activity in the southern Caribbean, striking vessels in international waters that it has alleged, without evidence, are carrying drugs.Last week Trump announced the suspension of payments and subsidies to Colombia. This came after Petro told BBC News in September airstrikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean were an \"act of tyranny,\", accusing US officials of murdering a Colombian citizen and violating his country's sovereignty. Imposing sanctions on a head of state is rare but not unprecedented. The leaders of countries including Russia, North Korea and Venezuela have previously been sanctioned. ",

She passed away \"peacefully\" in a Bangkok hospital at 21:21 local time (14:21 GMT) on Friday, according to the Thai Royal Household Bureau.Sirikit had \"suffered several illnesses\" while in hospital since 2019, including a blood infection this month, it added.For more than six decades, Queen Sirikit was married to Thailand's longest-reigning monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016.King Vajiralongkorn has ordered the Thai Royal Household Bureau to organise a royal funeral, the statement added.Queen Sirikit's body will lie in state at the Grand Palace's Dusit Thorne Hall in Bangkok, according to the palace.Thai royal family members will also observe a year of mourning.Queen Sirikit married the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1950Queen Sirikit met her future husband, King Bhumibol, while studying music in Paris, where her father was stationed as Thai ambassador to France.\"It was hate at first sight,\" she said in a 1980 BBC documentary about the Thai monarchy, Soul of a Nation, adding that he had arrived late to their first meeting. \"Because he said he would arrive at four o'clock in the afternoon. He arrived at seven o'clock, kept me standing there, practising curtsy and curtsy,\" she said.The couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before King Bhumibol was crowned in Bangkok.As a young couple in the 1960s, Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol travelled around the world, meeting US president Dwight Eisenhower, the late Queen Elizabeth II - as well as Elvis Presley.During that decade, she frequently made international best dressed lists.ReutersQueen Sirikit greeted the late Queen Elizabeth II during a 1996 state visit to ThailandIn the rare 1980 interview with the BBC, she also described the relationship between the monarchy and people in Thailand, which continues to observe strict lese-majeste laws forbidding insult of the monarchy. She said: \"Kings and queens of Thailand have always been in close contact with the people and they usually regard the king as the father of the nation.\"That is why we do not have much private life, because we are considered father and mother of the nation.\"She was seen as a key maternal figure for the country, with her birthday, 12 August, marked as Mother's Day since 1976.In 2008, she attended the funeral of an anti-government protester killed in violent clashes with police. Queen Sirikit suffered a stroke in 2012, after which she was rarely seen in public.She is survived by her son and three daughters. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoHugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  , Jerusalem and Raffi Berg,LondonUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said \"a lot of countries\" have offered to be part of an international security force for Gaza - a key part of President Donald Trump's peace plan - but added Israel would have to be comfortable with participants.Speaking on a visit to Israel, Rubio said talks on forming the International Stabilization Force (ISF) were continuing and that it would come into effect \"as soon as it possibly can\".It remained unclear, however, how such a force could be deployed without an understanding with Hamas.He said the Israel-Hamas ceasefire had made \"historic\" progress since it began two weeks ago, but warned to expect \"ups and downs and twists and turns\".\"There is no plan B,\" he said. \"This is the best plan. It's the only plan. And it's one that we think can succeed.\" Rubio said conditions had to be created \"so that never again will we see what happened on 7 October, so that you can actually be in a place [Gaza] that no longer has elements operating within it that are a threat to Israel or to their own people for that matter\".The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages.At least 68,280 Palestinians have been killed by the Israel military campaign that followed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the United Nations as reliable.Rubio said Hamas will be disarmed, as required by Trump's plan. \"If Hamas refuses to demilitarise, it'll be a violation of the agreement and that'll have to be enforced,\" he said.\"Hamas cannot govern and cannot be involved in governing the future of Gaza,\" he added.Rubio's visit caps a week in which senior American officials, including Vice-President JD Vance, came to Israel. It's a sign that Washington is determined to make Trump's plan for Gaza succeed and is concerned that actions by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government might collapse it. In Israeli media, the effort has been described as \"Bibi-sitting\", a play with the prime minister's nickname.In recent days, multiple reports have suggested the White House's frustration with the Israeli government, fuelled by the military's deadly response to an attack it blamed on Hamas in Gaza last weekend and the vote in the Israeli parliament towards the annexation of the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, while Vance was visiting.The Israeli Haaretz newspaper reported that American officials said they would \"not tolerate any surprises from Israel that could jeopardise the ceasefire\", and that they were expecting advance notice from Israel before any strikes in Gaza. \"In practice,\" the report said, \"the US [was] taking over certain security authorities from Israel\".In public, Netanyahu, whose coalition relies on the support of ultra-nationalist ministers, has rejected reports that Washington is making decisions on Israel's behalf, describing the country's relationship as a partnership. The apparent pressure from the country's most important ally, at a time when Israel faces unprecedented isolation, risks derailing his strategy to frame the war in Gaza as a victory at home. This narrative will be essential in the campaign for the next parliamentary election, which should be held by October 2026.Both Rubio and Vance tried to strike a positive tone in their public statements – both said they were optimistic the ceasefire would hold – while also acknowledging that the negotiations over the remaining points would be difficult and long. Those issues include the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, the future governance of Gaza and the formation of the ISF, as well as the disarmament by Hamas, and they offered no indication of how those talks would proceed.Rubio said there were \"a lot of countries\" that offered to take part in the ISF. \"Obviously, as you put together this force, it'll have to be people that Israel's comfortable, or countries that Israel's comfortable with as well,\" he added, without elaborating.This appeared to be a reference to Turkey, which has become a major player in the negotiations, amid reports Israel has vetoed the country's involvement.The scope of the ISF's mission remains unclear, as countries appear to be concerned with the possibility that its forces might end up confronting Hamas fighters if there is no agreement with the group over the ISF deployment.Seeing the peace plan through is \"not going to be an easy ride\", Rubio said. \"There are going to be bumps along the road, but we have to make it work.\"",

    "body": "A German company inadvertently embroiled in the Louvre Museum heist after one of its lifts was used in the theft is making the most of its free publicity - by launching a new advertising campaign.Werne-based firm Böcker this week published a social media post featuring the now-famous image of its furniture ladder extending up to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo. \"When you need to move fast,\" reads a banner under the image. \"The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min - quiet as a whisper.\"Video has emerged of the alleged thieves escaping on the mechanical ladder after stealing €88m worth (£76m; $102m) of France's crown jewels on Sunday.The company's managing director, Alexander Böcker, told news agency AFP on Wednesday that, when it became clear no one was injured in the heist, it had used \"a touch of humour\" to draw attention to the family-run business.\"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us,\" Mr Böcker said.\"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company.\" How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Reaction to Böcker's new campaign has been enthusiastic, with responses on social media including \"marketing genius\" and \"excellent, that is German quality\".\"Your messaging takes the crown,\" one commenter quipped.Mr Böcker told AFP that he recognised his company's device from news reports, saying the machine was sold \"a few years ago to a French customer who rents this type of equipment in Paris and the surrounding area\".The alleged jewel thieves had arranged to have the machine demonstrated to them last week and had stolen it during the demonstration, he said.The thieves arrived at the Louvre on Sunday shortly after the museum opened its doors.Within eight minutes, they had made off with some of France's most valuable treasures, including those belonging to former royalty and imperial rulers.Among the eight items stolen were diadems, necklaces, earrings and brooches adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.The Louvre reopened on Wednesday, a few days after what has been called France's most shocking theft.The museum's director admitted on Wednesday that security failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft and that CCTV around its perimeter was weak and \"aging\".\"We failed these jewels,\" Laurence des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she added.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors said they believed the robbers acted under orders from a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJaroslav Lukiv and Vitaliy Shevchenko,Russia editor at Downing StreetEPA/ShutterstockMore than 20 nations supporting Ukraine have pledged to \"take Russian oil and gas off the global market\" as part of efforts to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war.\"We're choking off funding for Russia's war machine,\" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, after hosting a summit of the \"coalition of the willing\" in London.The UK and US have in recent days sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies, while the EU targeted Moscow's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also in London, said \"pressure\" on Russia was the only way to stop the fighting. However, no long-range missile deliveries to Ukraine were announced at the summit.Zelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets – including oil refineries and weapons depots – deep inside Russia.But during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks.On Thursday, President Putin warned that if \"such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming\".Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Speaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Starmer said Putin was \"not serious about peace\", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a \"clear plan for the rest of the year\" on supporting Ukraine.The UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to \"unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence\". He gave no further details.On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years - but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth €140bn (£122bn).Asked about a so-called \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas EveIn London, the \"coalition of the willing\" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences\" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure.Zelensky warned that Russia \"wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment\", adding that \"they want to break us\".Comments by the leaders in London will be disappointing for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Kyiv's allies were planning to make Russia stop attacking Ukraine.No doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Starmer said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.But there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or make Putin come to the negotiating table.EPA/ShutterstockUkrainian officials say a kindergarten was hit in a Russian air strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv earlier this weekOver in Ukraine, several people who spoke to the BBC said they were more focused on everyday problems, rather than following Zelensky's trip to the UK.Yana Kolomiets, from Odesa, said there was a lack of electricity, heating and water in the southern city.\"The more scary thing is that the Russians started launching guided bombs on our region,\" she added.Tetiana Dankevych, from the capital Kyiv, said power outages and a problems with water supplies caused by Russian strikes were making life \"very difficult\".\"I don't have a feeling this war will end soon,\" she said.Further support for Ukraine's energy infrastructure was among the issues discussed at the London summit - however, no specific announcements were made.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also took part in the London meeting, while other leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - participated via a video link.Ukraine and its Western allies have publicly agreed with President Trump's proposal that the fighting should be immediately frozen along the vast front line for negotiations to begin.Russia has rejected this idea, repeating demands that Kyiv and its allies describe as de facto capitulation by Ukraine.Earlier on Friday, Zelensky held talks with King Charles at Windsor – their third meeting this year.",

    "body": "8 hours agoMallory MoenchStandWithUsMichael Smuss in an updated handout photoMichael Smuss, a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland who resisted the Nazis, has died aged 99 in Israel. He joined the ghetto uprising as a teenager in 1943, helping to make petrol bombs. Taken prisoner, he survived concentration camps and a death march before the end of World War II. After the war, he became an artist and Holocaust educator. The embassies of Germany and Poland in Israel paid tribute to him on social media. \"He repeatedly risked his life during the Holocaust, fighting for survival and helping other prisoners in the Warsaw Ghetto – even after he was captured by the Nazis and deported to concentration camps,\" the German embassy stated on X.The Polish embassy said Smuss \"lectured youth on the history of Polish Jews and expressed his memories through art. His legacy endures.\"The Polish embassy and the Holocaust Educational Trust, a UK charity, called Smuss the last surviving fighter of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. However, in 2018, Israeli officials and international media, including the BBC, reported that Simcha Rotem, who had just died aged 94, was the last surviving fighter of the uprising.Last month, Germany's ambassador to Israel awarded Smuss with the German Federal Cross of Merit, in recognition of his contribution to Holocaust education and promoting dialogue between the two countries, the embassy said.\"Thousands of people, especially young people in Germany, have learned from his testimonies.\"German Embassy in IsraelThe German ambassador to Israel awarded a medal to Michael Smuss in SeptemberSmuss was born in 1926 in the Free City of Danzig, a city-state that is now Gdansk, Poland. He later moved to Lodz before being deported to the Warsaw Ghetto with his father.Hundreds of thousands of Jews were crammed into the ghetto, where they faced poverty, starvation, disease and cold.Since Smuss spoke German, he was taken outside to work in a factory repairing and repainting helmets, he recounted in a video recorded for the Sumter Museum in the US in 2022.He joined the Jewish Resistance in the ghetto, and he and others started stealing as much paint thinner as possible to make petrol bombs.\"We filled up bottles which were put up on the roofs of all the houses close to the entrance of the ghetto with the expectation that once they're going to come, we'd be throwing them down\", he said.On 19 April the Nazis came to empty the ghetto, an enclave in Warsaw created by the Nazis to segregate and persecute Jews. The resistance fought back with weapons they had exchanged for warm clothes from Italian soldiers who had been sent from Africa to the Russian front.The resistance, which Smuss called \"the greatest uprising in this war against Germany\", lasted 28 days.\"It was very rough... no shower, no food. They were burning up, liquidating one house after another, full of smoke burning in your eyes,\" he said.He described thousands of bodies lying in front of houses and \"the smell of gas and decomposed bodies\".He, among some others, was taken prisoner on 29 April.Corbis via Getty ImagesMichael Smuss, identified by The Jerusalem Post as fourth from left, taken prisoner after the Warsaw Ghetto UprisingThey were put on a train to the Treblinka extermination camp. As he witnessed people dying on the journey, \"my heart became a stone\", he said.Along the way, the train was stopped by employers looking to retrieve workers that had been taken from their factories. Another German came looking for experienced workers, and Smuss offered himself and those he knew.\"When we left on the train to Treblinka, I was sure that my life was over,\" he told The Jerusalem Post earlier this year. \"But when the train came to a halt, I felt with all of my being that on this day I was not going to die.\"He was moved and endured forced labour at other camps, and finally a death march to Dachau, before his Nazi captors fled incoming American troops.He told The Jerusalem Post that his father was killed trying to escape one camp, while his mother and sister, who had been able to stay in Lodz, survived.Smuss initially returned to Poland, but then moved to the US, where he worked, studied and started a family. After experiencing trauma symptoms, he moved to Israel in 1979 alone to seek help, where he took up art and educating others about the Holocaust. He is survived by his wife.",

    "body": "3 hours agoWill GrantMexico, Central America and Cuba correspondentIn a late-night communique on Thursday, the Cuban Government said that it had extradited a Chinese citizen, Zhi Dong Zhang, to the authorities in Mexico. Hours later, Mexico's security chief then confirmed his subsequent extradition to the United States on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.It brought to an abrupt end a months-long, audacious escape attempt by one of the world's most wanted fugitives.Known by various aliases including Brother Wang, Pancho and HeHe, Zhi Dong Zhang is accused by the US Justice Department of masterminding a vast international ring of fentanyl trafficking and money laundering covering numerous nations but particularly China, Mexico and the US.The list of charges against Mr Zhang is long but in essence US prosecutors and the Mexican Attorney General's office accuse him of being a major player in the global drug trade. They say he has laundered millions of dollars in drug money for both the Sinaloa Cartel and the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG) as part of a worldwide drug distribution network.\"Brother Wang can be seen as a key link between Mexican cartels and Chinese chemical companies in sourcing the pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl\", explains former DEA agent, Mike Vigil, adding that he was also vital in converting drug funds into cryptocurrency.If convicted, Zhi Dong Zhang can expect to share a similar fate as other drug kingpins like Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman and Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada in a high-security facility in the United States.But how 'Brother Wang' ended up in custody in Havana is an extraordinary tale involving fleeing house arrest in Mexico City, reportedly through a hole in a wall, taking a private jet to Cuba and an ultimately failed attempt to enter Russia.Zhi Dong Zhang was arrested in Mexico City in a joint security operation in October 2024. He was initially held in a maximum-security prison but was later granted house arrest by a judge – a decision that President Claudia Sheinbaum called \"outrageous\".Zhang's escape had all the hallmarks of another embarrassing episode for Mexico: a man considered a vital cog in the machinery of drug smuggling, able to disappear from under the noses of the Mexican authorities tasked with guarding him. El Chapo Guzman managed that feat twice, much to Washington's frustration, before he was finally put on a plane in handcuffs to the US.That Mexican authorities were able to recover their prisoner and send him north came down to two things – an apparent stroke of luck in Russia and the strength of Mexico's security relationship with Havana.When Zhang reached Cuba in July 2025, he set about making his next steps towards reaching a country with no extradition treaty with the US, officials say. There is a direct commercial flight to Moscow from Havana and Zhang, they allege, was able to secure a seat on it using fake papers. However, the papers didn't get him past the immigration authorities in Russia. It has been reported that the Russians didn't fully appreciate who they had in their custody and, after he was briefly detained, they turned Zhang around and sent him back to Cuba.On arriving back in Havana a second time, the Cuban security services were now aware of his real identity.Security analysts believe the authorities in Cuba held onto him for several months to interrogate him at length before sending him back to Mexico and, inevitably, onwards to the US. Mexico's Public Security Secretary, Omar Harfuch, was quick to thank Cuba for their cooperation over 'Brother Wang' – ultimately, for sparing their blushes over another escaped high-profile prisoner.As always following the arrest of an alleged kingpin, the question becomes how far their removal will affect the global drug trade.Given Brother Wang has spent the past year either in prison, under house arrest or on the run, the question may be moot, Mr Vigil said, as his absence has already largely been felt in Mexico's criminal underworld:\"It's really not going to have an impact as the cartels already have individuals working for them who can start to replace to Brother Wang,\" said Mr Vigil. \"Even in the case of El Chapo Guzman who was a much bigger figure, it had no impact on the global drug trade\", he argues.Over his first year in office, US President Donald Trump has pressured his Mexican counterpart to do more on the issue of fentanyl trafficking and President Sheinbaum's administration has duly responded in kind. She has significantly increased seizures of the drug compared to her predecessor and her administration has sent dozens of convicted drug cartel members to the US to serve sentences there. They included several high-level drug names like Rafael Caro Quintero, wanted for the murder of a DEA agent in 1985.Her co-operation on the fentanyl issue, as well as on undocumented immigration, is considered the reason Mr Trump has refrained from imposing the same level of trade tariffs on Mexico as he has on other commercial partners.Brother Wang's extradition will bring genuine satisfaction in Washington at having taken a key figure in Mexican cartels' financial operations out of circulation. That, in turn, will please the Sheinbaum administration in Mexico and strengthen their claim to be in lockstep with their US counterparts on security.However, slowing or reducing the movement of pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl from China to the Americas in any lasting way will take more than the extradition of one man.",

    "body": "Ontario to stop running anti-tariff advert that angered Trump3 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter in TorontoGetty ImagesDoug Ford said the advert will still run over the weekend, but will be paused on Monday so that trade talks between Canada and the US can resumeOntario Premier Doug Ford has said he will pause his province's anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the US, after it prompted President Donald Trump to terminate trade talks.Ford said he made the decision after speaking to Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday, adding that the TV spot will be paused on Monday \"so that trade talks can resume\". It will still run over the weekend on US networks, he said, including during the Major League Baseball World Series games.Carney told reporters earlier on Friday that Canada is prepared to resume trade talks with the US \"when the Americans are ready\".Trump criticised the advert late on Thursday night in a Truth Social post, calling it \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\". He said trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".The advert, which was sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focused on foreign trade.Trump's termination of trade talks came after the Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving Reagan's legacy, released a statement saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It accused the advert of misrepresenting Reagan's address, and said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use it.EXPLAINED: What's in advert that caused trade talks to collapse?Canada will restart trade talks when 'Americans are ready', says CarneyOn Friday, Ford said the intention of the advert was \"to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build\" and the impact of tariffs.\"We've achieved our goal, having reached US audiences at the highest levels,\" Ford said.Trump's reaction to the advert has ignited debate in Canada over whether Ford's combative approach to US trade talks is the right one, or whether the country would be better served by striking a friendlier chord with its neighbour and closest trade ally.Canada's prime minister: American trade policy 'fundamentally changed'Canada is still the only G7 country that has not reached a trade deal with Trump since he began introducing sweeping tariffs.The US has imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Those sector tariffs have especially hurt Ontario, where the bulk of Canada's automanufacturing industry is based.Prime Minister Carney has attempted for months to negotiate a deal that would ease the tariffs. Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, making its economy particularly vulnerable. In doing so, he has opted for friendly face-to-face meetings and text messages with the US president.Ford, on the other hand, has taken a more defiant stance. He pulled US liquor off Ontario shelves and briefly threatened withholding energy exports. Last week, he told reporters he was \"sick and tired of sitting and rolling over\", after car manufacturer Stellantis announced it would move some production out of its Brampton, Ontario, plant into the United States.\"We need to fight back,\" Ford said at the time. The next day, he launched the advertisement campaign that eventually drew the ire of the US president.'Theatrics and hyperbole'Trump's abrupt termination of trade talks is unsurprising to most Canadians, said Mahmood Nanji, a fellow at the Ivey Business School at Western University and former associate deputy finance minister in Ontario. The US president had made a similar threat earlier this year after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms.\"His posts tend to be full of theatrics and hyperbole,\" Mr Nanji said. And while some might appreciate Ford standing up for the Ontario industries hardest hit by tariffs, the timing and tone of Ford's advert campaign has not helped Canada's case, causing an \"unnecessary distraction,\" Mr Nanji added.It is unclear if trade talks will indeed resume now that Ford has pulled the ad, and President Trump is yet to respond to the announcement it will stop running.The White House on Friday signalled frustration with what it called \"Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers,\" and added that efforts to address these issues \"have not led to any constructive progress\".Carney has made some appeasements to keep talks going, including removing retaliatory tariffs and dropping Canada's digital services tax. But he has repeatedly said that he is searching for \"the best deal for Canada.\"Both Trump and Carney are heading to Asia on Friday for the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur. The Canadian prime minister told reporters that the focus of his trip would be \"developing new partnerships and opportunities, including with the economic giants of Asia\".But Carney also left the door open to continue trade talks with the US. Mr Nanji said the advert saga is a reminder that the path to a deal for Canada will not be an easy one, regardless of negotiation methods.He noted remarks by Carney earlier in the week, in which he stated that \"the US has fundamentally changed its approach to trade\" and that Canada's close tie to America has become a vulnerability. \"We have to take care of ourselves because we can't rely on one foreign partner,\" Carney said in a speech Wednesday to tease his government's first budget, which will be unveiled on 4 November.The speech, Mr Nanji said, was also meant to \"caution Canadians that this is going to be a really rocky road with the Americans\".",

But in a country steeped in patriarchy, challenges remain.In such a scenario, experts say messaging becomes extremely important to keep the drumbeat going to change norms and to make people more aware of the need to take care of their girls and mothers.And to do that, Mr Gates perhaps couldn't have chosen a better platform than Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.First launched in July 2000, the series had a very successful long innings with several thousand episodes that were broadcast almost daily on Star Plus for eight- and-a-half years before it was discontinued, says Shailaja Bajpai, columnist and Readers' Editor for Print new site. In July, 25 years after it first hit the screens, Kyunki... returned for its second innings.JioStarBill Gates' unexpected cameo seems to have brought the show back into the limelightIndian audiences found the show, based on the complex domestic relationship between Irani's character Tulsi and her mother-in-law, riveting. The trials and tribulations of the dutiful new bride had families reorganise their daily routines to ensure they didn't miss out a single episode.Irani's character was - and is - at the centre of this story of the fictitious Virani family. In the first season, she played a young woman who fell in love with and married the scion of a wealthy family. A quarter of a century later, Tulsi is middle aged, her children are all grown up and she is about to become a ma-in-law herself. But the battles she's fighting now are still with jealous and misguided family members and the drama - and the melodrama - of the original season remain in abundance, Ms Bajpai says.\"If you take away the gadgets, the mobile phones and the laptops, essentially remove all the window dressing, it's still the same story. It's just been updated.\" But, she adds that one thing that's different now is that the social messaging has increased. \"I think that's because it fits her profile more. She served as the minister for women and child development so the show now talks about divorce, child and maternal health and other socially-relevant issues.\"The four-minute-long segment with Mr Gates starts with the Microsoft founder greeting her in American-accented Hindi - \"Namaste Tulsi-ji,\" he says, asking her if he'd said it right?\"Yes, absolutely perfect,\" she beams.The call comes after Tulsi is seen in a viral video at a godh-bharai (baby shower) dishing out health advice to an expectant mother. Tulsi's son, who's posted the video, tells her that he had tagged Mr Gates, wondering if he'd be willing to talk to Tulsi on a video call. \"He's accepted,\" he squeals with delight.Tulsi initially seems a bit nervous. \"What will I say to him? I only do video calls with you all or your father about grocery shopping,\" she says.jiostarFirst launched in July 2000, the series ran for eight- and-a-half years. In July, 25 years after it first hit the screens, it returned for its second inningsBut once the laptop is fired up and Mr Gates comes in vision, Tulsi comes into her own, explaining the reason for the \"traditional\" ritual.\"We come together to bless a young expectant mother, we wish her lots of good health,\" she says.\"We tell women how essential it is to look after their health, their nutrition and diet. We tell them to follow the doctors' instructions and go to a hospital for their delivery.\"  The two agree that \"when mothers are healthy, children thrive and the world can make significant progress\".In a statement to the BBC, makers of the show JioStar Entertainment said the show was using storytelling to spotlight critical issues around maternal and child health.\"We believe that storytelling can do more than entertain, it can inform, inspire and drive awareness on issues that matter,\" JioStar's Sumanta Bose said. \"By weaving topics of social significance into our narratives, we aim to create impact that reaches beyond the screen and brings about a meaningful difference in people's lives,\" he added. The release says that Mr Gates will appear in three episodes of the show.In its second innings, Ms Bajpai says, the show has had to compete with a multitude of other offerings on OTT platforms and hasn't found the same resonance with the audience.But Mr Gates' unexpected cameo seems to have brought it back into the limelight - for now at least.A promo of the episode received more than six million views on Instagram alone in less than a day, with thousands of comments echoing a sense of surprise and amusement.\"What is this multiverse,\" said one comment which was liked by more than 17,000 people. Another said: \"It's so cringe but I also love it so much.\"",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship2 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a war\", after it sent the world's largest warship towards the Caribbean in a major escalation of its military build-up in the region.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which can carry up to 90 aircraft, to move from the Mediterranean on Friday.\"They are fabricating a new eternal war,\" Maduro told state media. \"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war.\"The US has been increasing its military presence in the Caribbean, sending warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft in what it says is a campaign to target drug traffickers.It has also carried out ten airstrikes on boats it says belong to traffickers, including one on Friday when Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed.That operation took place in the Caribbean Sea, against a ship Hegseth said belonged to the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation. The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. The Trump administration says it is conducting a war on drug trafficking, but it has also been accused by both experts and members of Congress of launching an intimidation campaign in an effort to destabilise Maduro's government.Maduro is a longtime foe of Trump, and the US president has accused him of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation which he denies.ANALYSIS: What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?\"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up is intended to \"strike fear\" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.In its Friday announcement, the Pentagon said the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle TCOs\", or transnational criminal organisations, spokesman Sean Parnell said.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroThe carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela.\"We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" he said earlier this week.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.The aircraft carrier last publicly transmitted its location three days ago off the coast of Croatia, in the Adriatic Sea.Its deployment marks a significant escalation in the US military buildup in the region. It is also likely to increase tensions with Venezuela, whose government Washington has long accused of harbouring drug traffickers.The carrier's large aircraft load can include jets and planes for transport and reconnaissance. Its first long-term deployment was in 2023.It is unclear which vessels will accompany it when it moves to the region, but it can operate as part of a strike group that includes destroyers carrying missiles and other equipment.The US has carried out a series of strikes on boats in recent weeks, in what President Donald Trump has described as an effort to curtail drug trafficking.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike announced on Friday was the tenth the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic US senators wrote to the White House and alleged the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval.Trump said he has the legal authority to order the strikes, and has designated Tren de Aragua a terrorist organisation.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that \"if people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States\".The six deaths in the operation Hegseth announced on Friday brings the total people killed in the US strikes to at least 43.",

But I thought that over the course of a year he had gained some introspection,\" she said.</p><p>Turning to Dogan, she added: \"You don't understand that this was rape. When will you admit that it's a crime? I am ashamed for you.\"</p><p>She also addressed the devastation that had engulfed her family since the trial. </p><p>Her daughter, Caroline Darian, maintains she too was drugged and abused by her father after photos showing her unconscious were found on Pelicot's computer. </p><p>Ms Darian has since spoken about feeling unsupported by her mother. The two are reportedly no longer in contact and Ms Darian was not in court with Gisèle this week.</p><p>\"My family is trying to rebuild itself however it can,\" Gisèle said. \"I hope [Caroline] finds the answers she is looking for. I hope one day we can find each other again.\"</p><p>She also asked to stop being referred to as an icon. \"I am an ordinary woman who dared to open up her trial,\" she said. \"I have become an icon against my will.\"</p><p>As in the original trial, Gisèle ended her statement with a thought for other victims of rape – the majority of whom did not have the wealth of evidence that she had to bring her abusers to court.</p><p>\"I want to say to them to never be ashamed of what was inflicted upon us, because it is not their fault,\" she said.</p></div></article>",

There is no war against smuggling; there is a war for oil and it must be stopped by the world. The aggression is against all of Latin America and the Caribbean.\"</p><p>Petro did not provide further details about the alleged identities of those on board. The US has not commented on the identities of the individuals killed in the strikes.</p><p>The White House said in a statement that it \"looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement\". </p><p>It said that while the two nations had \"policy differences\", the US remained \"committed to close co-operation on a range of shared priorities, including regional security and stability\". </p><p>Speaking on Thursday at the EU Global Gateway Forum in Brussels, Petro said he had asked for all Caribbean foreign ministers to meet over the strikes. </p><p>The US says its strikes, which began on 2 September, had targeted vessels off the coast of Venezuela that it alleges were carrying illegal drugs. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o\">First US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': Was it legal?</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c78nl9lz8zeo\">What is Trump's goal after bombing 'Venezuela drugs boat'?</a></li></ul><p>The measure considered by the Senate on Wednesday, which would have required Trump to seek congressional approval for the strikes, was rejected in a 48-51 vote.</p><p>It had been introduced by Democratic Senators Schiff and Tim Kaine.

The new prime minister faces a deadline on Monday to put next year's budget before parliament.  </p></div><div><p>The Élysée said the president had \"tasked [Lecornu] with forming a government\" and Macron's entourage indicated he had been given \"carte blanche\" to act.</p><p>Lecornu, who is 39 and one of Macron's most loyal allies, then released a long statement on X in which he accepted \"out of duty the mission entrusted to me by the president, to do everything to provide France with a budget by the end of the year and respond to the everyday problems of our compatriots\".</p><p>When he appeared on French TV this week, Lecornu described himself as a \"soldier-monk\", and as he prepared to get to grips with forming a government he said on Friday \"I will do everything to succeed in this mission\".</p></div><div><p>Political divisions over how to bring down France's national debt and cut the budget deficit have led to the fall of two of the past three prime ministers in the last year, so his challenge is immense. </p><p>France's public debt earlier this year was almost 114% of economic output (GDP) - the third highest in the eurozone - and this year's budget deficit is projected to hit 5.4% of GDP.</p><p>Among the conditions Lecornu listed for taking on the job, one was that \"no-one will be able to shirk\" the necessity of restoring France's public finances. With only 18 months before the end of Macron's presidency, he also  warned that anyone joining his government would have to put on hold their presidential ambitions. </p><p>What makes it even harder for Lecornu is that he will face a vote of confidence in a National Assembly where Macron has no majority to support him. The president's popularity hit a record low this week, according to an Elabe poll that put his approval rating on 14%.</p><p>Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally, which was not invited to Macron's talks with party leaders on Friday, said that Lecornu's reappointment, by a president \"more than ever isolated and disconnected at the Élysée, is a bad joke\". </p><p>Bardella said his party would immediately bring a vote of no confidence against a doomed coalition, whose only reason for being was fear of an election.</p></div><div><p>Lecornu at least knows the pitfalls ahead as he tries to form a government, because he has already spent two days this week talking to parties that might join his government.</p><p>He was first appointed prime minister on 9 September and spent the next three weeks putting together a government, only for it to fall apart overnight when the the leader of the conservative Republicans, Bruno Retailleau, criticised one of the ministers.</p><p>By themselves, the centrist parties cannot form a government, and there are splits within the conservative Republicans who have helped prop up Macron's governments since he lost his majority in elections last year. Retailleau, who is known to have presidential ambitions, has made clear he will not be part of Lecornu II.</p><p>So the centrist prime minister will also look to left-wing parties for potential support.</p><p>In an attempt to court the left, Macron's team indicated the president was considering a delay to part of his highly contentious pension reforms passed in 2023 which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.</p><p>That fell short of what left-wing leaders wanted, as they were hoping he would choose a prime minister from their side. Olivier Faure of the Socialists said \"since we've not been given any guarantees, we won't give any guarantee [to back the prime minister] in a vote of confidence\".</p><p>Fabien Roussel from the Communists said after meeting the president that the left wanted real change, and a prime minister from the president's centrist camp would not be accepted by the French people.</p><p>Greens leader Marine Tondelier said she was \"stunned\" Macron had offered the left almost nothing, adding that \"all of this is going to turn out very badly\". </p></div></article>",

Carmaker Ford even had to temporarily pause production.</p><p>In addition to tightening rules for rare earth exports, China has opened a monopoly investigation into the US tech firm Qualcomm that could stall its acquisition of another chipmaker. </p><p>Although Qualcomm is based in the US, a significant portion of its business is concentrated in China.</p><p>Beijing has also said it will charge new port fees to ships with ties to the US, including those owned or operated by US firms.</p><p>\"Some very strange things are happening in China!\" Trump wrote in a post on social media on Friday. \"They are becoming very hostile.\"</p><p>The US and China have been in a fragile trade détente since May, when the two sides agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods that had nearly stopped trade between the two countries. </p><p>The move left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a new 10% tariff.</p><p>Officials have held a series of talks since then on matters including TikTok, agricultural purchases, and the trade of rare earths and advanced technology like semiconductors.</p><p>The two sides were expected to meet again this month at a summit in South Korea.</p></div><div><p>China expert Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Xi's recent actions were a bid to shape the upcoming talks, noting that the recent rare earths directive does not go into effect immediately.</p><p>\"He's looking for ways to seize the initiative,\" he said. \"The Trump administration is having to play a game of whack-a-mole and deal with these issues as they come up.\"</p><p>He added that he did not think China was worried about US retaliation in response.</p><p>\"What China took away from the Liberation Day tariffs and the cycle of escalation followed by de-escalation is that the Chinese side had a higher pain threshold,\" he said. \"From their perspective, the Trump administration blinked.\" </p><p>In prior rounds of trade talks, China has pushed for looser US restrictions on semiconductors. It is also interested in securing more stable tariff policies<b> </b>that would make it easier for its businesses to sell into the US. </p><p>Xi had previously used as leverage his country's dominance of rare earths production. </p><p>But the export rules unveiled this week target overseas defence manufacturers, making them particularly serious, said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. </p><p>\"Nothing makes America move like targeting our defence industry,\" she said. \"The US is going to have to negotiate because we have limited options, and in an era of rising geopolitical tension and potential conflict, we need to build our industrial defence base.\"</p><p>While a Trump-Xi meeting now looks unlikely, she said it was not necessarily completely off the table.<b> </b>Ms Baskaran said there's still time and room for talks. China's new rules don't take effect until December. </p><p>\"Negotiations are likely imminent,\" she said. \"Who does them and where they happen will be determined with time.\"</p></div></article>",

    "body": "<div><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges by a grand jury. </p><p>James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. </p><p>Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. </p><p>In a statement, James accused the president - who recently publicly pressured prosecutors to file criminal charges against her - of a \"desperate weaponization of our justice system\".</p></div><div><p>\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general,\" she said. </p><p>\"These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.\"</p><p>The US prosecutor assigned to the case, Lindsey Halligan, meanwhile, said the case proved that \"no one is above the law\". </p><p>\"The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" she said. </p><p>\"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump's only goal is \"political retribution\" - Letitia James responds to indictment</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Trump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.</p><p>James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.</p><p>The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home. </p><p>The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead \"used as a rental investment property\", which was being rented to a family of three.</p><p>The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.</p><p>Halligan said that, if convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison per count and up to a $1 million (£751,755) fine on each count.</p><p>James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said: \"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"</p><p>Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. </p><p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.</p><p>James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress.</p><p>The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.</p><p>In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. </p><p>During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a \"political witch hunt\" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law\". </p><p>James on Thursday said she stands behind her office's litigation against Trump and his organisation. </p><p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said James's indictment \"is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable.\"</p><p>The New York Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union called it \"the latest in a long list of brazen abuses of power by President Trump\".</p></div>",

I want to hear the truth.

One of the main targets of these controls appears to be overseas defence manufacturers, including those in the US, who rely on rare earths from China.</p><p>China had added several rare earths and related material to its export control list in April, as the trade war with Washington ramped up, which caused a major global shortage.</p><p>But the new announcement makes clear that licences are unlikely to be issued to arms manufacturers and certain companies in the chip industry.</p><p>Even the technology used to mine and process rare earths, or to make magnets from rare earths, can only be exported with permission from the government, the Commerce Ministry said. </p><p>Chinese firms are also banned from working with foreign companies on rare earths without government permission.</p><p>The latest announcement also clarifies the specific technologies and processes that are restricted.</p><p>These include mining, smelting and separation, magnetic material manufacturing, and recycling rare earths from other resources.</p><p>The assembly, debugging, maintenance, repair, and upgrading of production equipment are also prohibited from export without permission, the announcement added.</p><p>This could have a major impact in the US, which has a significant rare earths mining industry but lacks processing facilities.</p></div><div><p>The new regulations create Beijing's version of US rules which block countries from selling chip-making equipment to China.</p><p>The US has used those measures to slow China's development of powerful chips that could be used for artificial intelligence (AI) with military applications.</p><p>Trade expert Alex Capri believes China's new regulations \"are specifically timed\" ahead of Xi and Trump's expected meeting later this month.</p><p>Beijing has targeted key vulnerabilities in US electronics and weapons manufacturing, mirroring America's earlier moves against China's chip industry, he added.</p></div><div><p>Rare earths are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.</p><p>Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.</p><p>Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like neodymium, yttrium and europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.</p><p>For instance, neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, electric car motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.</p><p>China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.</p><p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-66cdf862-5e96-4e6e-90b8-a407b597c8d9\">The price of the rare earth metals the world buys from China</a></li></ul><p><i>Additional reporting by Ian Tang of BBC Monitoring</i></p></div>",

After Mr Comey's lawyer requested a speedy trial, the judge set a date of 5 January.</p></div><div><p>Both the prosecution and defence expected the trial to last just two or three days.</p><p>In court on Wednesday, Mr Comey's lawyer Patrick Fitzgerald told the judge that they planned to file several motions to dismiss the case before a trial, arguing the prosecution was vindictive and that a US attorney had been unlawfully appointed to take over the case.</p><p>Mr Comey was fired as FBI director in 2017, about four months into Trump's first term as president. At the time, Mr Comey had been leading an investigation into Russian election interference and whether there were any links between Moscow and Trump's campaign.</p><p>The federal government alleges Mr Comey lied to Congress during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September 2020, when he was being questioned about both the Russia election probe and an investigation into Trump's 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.</p><p>He told the hearing that he had not authorised someone at the FBI to leak information about the investigations - a statement the Justice Department alleges was untrue and therefore misleading.</p><p>Prosecutors also accuse Mr Comey of \"corruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct and impede\" the panel by making false statements to it.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj07ndrnr34o\">What is Comey accused of?</a></li></ul><p>Mr Comey's case was originally overseen by Erik Siebert, a Virginia prosecutor who resigned under pressure from Trump after his investigation into another political adversary - New York Attorney General Letitia James - failed to bring criminal charges. </p><p>Trump then appointed Lindsey Halligan to replace him, who secured a grand jury indictment against Mr Comey less than a week into the job. Prosecutors before her had declined to take on the case due to a lack of evidence.</p><p>Mr Comey appeared in good spirits as he entered the courtroom on Wednesday, chatting with his attorneys and making jokes. He was joined by his wife, Patrice Failor, and daughter Maureen Comey, a federal prosecutor whom the Trump administration recently fired.</p><p>After listening to the judge read his rights and the two counts against him in court on Wednesday, Mr Comey was asked if he understood the charges.</p><p>\"I do, your honour. Thank you very much,\" he told the court.</p><p>US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff said the two charges each carry a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to a $200,000 (£149,442).</p><p>Ms Halligan's hasty ascent to the role of top federal prosecutor in Virginia's eastern district in September was reflected in Wednesday's proceedings, when defence lawyers complained they did not have access to classified documents that prosecutors intended to submit as evidence. </p><p>\"We feel the cart has been put before the horse,\" Mr Fitzgerald said.</p><p>Judge Nachmanoff warned the government: \"I will not slow this case down because the government does not promptly turn over information.\"</p><p>During his tenure as FBI director, Mr Comey sparked a backlash from Democrats when he announced the investigation into Clinton's emails just days before the 2016 presidential election. Charges against Clinton were never brought, leading to criticism from Republicans as well. </p><p>Since leaving government, Mr Comey has been an ardent critic of the Trump administration.</p><p>In a video Mr Comey posted to his Instagram after he was indicted, he said he was innocent and accused Trump of acting like a \"tyrant\".</p><p>\"My family and I have know for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump,\" he said. \"We will not live on our knees.\"</p><p>\"I'm innocent,\" he added. \"So let's have a trial.\"</p><p>The charges against Mr Comey came after Trump posted on social media demanding his attorney general, Pam Bondi, prosecute Mr Comey and others.</p></div>",

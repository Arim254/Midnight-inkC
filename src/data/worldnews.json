    "body": "8 hours agoGetty ImagesA search and rescue operation continues for the rest of the group, which includes other foreign nationals and local guidesKathryn Armstrong and Diwakar Pyakurel & Phanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali in KathmanduAt least three climbers, including a French national and two Nepalese people, have died after being hit by an avalanche on a Himalayan peak in north-eastern Nepal, police say. The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. A further four climbers - two Italians, a German and a Canadian - are feared dead but a search for them is continuing. The killed and missing were part of a group of 12 trekkers and local guides that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told the BBC. Five Nepali guides who returned to the base camp were injured but not critically. \"Three bodies have been seen and rescue teams have to find four more,\" local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC. It is not clear if the other two confirmed dead, who are both Nepali, were working with the group or were climbers themselves. Mr Mahato said a rescue helicopter had landed on Monday in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp.Efforts to locate those still missing have been hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, according to local media reports. The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft).The Yalung Ri mountain is located in Nepal's Dolakha districtSeparately, attempts to rescue two Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale the Panbari mountain in western Nepal are continuing.Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week. The third member of the group, named in media reports as Velter Perlino, 65, has since been rescued.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains. Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas. Two British and one Irish woman were among a group that had to be rescued after being trapped for several days in the western Mustang region. Severe weather also left hundreds of hikers stranded near Mount Everest in October. ",

    "body": "Diane Ladd, three-time Academy Award nominee and star of Wild at Heart, has died at 89. Her daughter, actress Laura Dern, confirmed her death on Monday. \"My amazing hero and my profound gift of a mother, Diane Ladd, passed with me beside her this morning,\" Dern said in a statement, adding that her final moments were spent at home in California. Dern, who starred with her mother in 1991's Rambling Rose,  did not share Ladd's cause of death.\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her.\" Ladd's career on stage and screen spanned decades. Her big break in film came as a waitress in Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in 1974, which earned her an Oscar nomination.She went on to appear in dozens of films after that, including as recently as 2022, when she played a grandmother in the coming-of-age film Gigi & Nate, and also acted frequently on television shows.She was married to actor Bruce Dern from 1960 to 1969. The couple had two children, Oscar-winner Laura Dern and a baby girl, Diane Elizabeth Dern, who died in an accident in 1962, when she was 18 months old. \"She fell into the pool. She hit her head and knocked herself out. And it all happened instantly. And she died, and you will never get over that,\" Ladd told the BBC's US partner CBS News in 2023. Ladd had a close relationship with Laura, her second child, and they shared the screen many times. When Dern starred in David Lynch's Wild at Heart and later in the HBO series Enlightened, Ladd played her mother both times.They were also the first mother-daughter pair to be nominated for an Academy Award for the same movie, Rambling Rose. Neither won that year.In 2023, they wrote a book together called Honey, Baby, Mine: A Mother and Daughter Talk Life, Death, Love.Ladd told CBS that she originally discouraged Dern from becoming an actress.\"She was only, like, 11 years old, and I said, 'Don't be an actress. Be a doctor, be a lawyer,'\" she said. \"Nobody cares if you put on weight or your chin points when you cry if you're a doctor. They just want you to be the best you can be. But an actress? They care, care, care, care, care.\"Dern says she pushed back. \"No. It is all I knew,\" she said.",

    "body": "7 hours agoMichael Sheils McNamee,Business reporter and Danielle Kaye,Business reporterOpenAI has signed a $38bn (£29bn) contract with Amazon to access its cloud computing infrastructure, as the start-up continues its run of major partnerships to secure computing power. In 2025, the ChatGPT maker has signed deals worth more than $1tn with Oracle, Broadcom, AMD and chip-making giant Nvidia. Its latest deal reduces its reliance on Microsoft.As part of the seven-year agreement, OpenAI will gain access to Nvidia graphics processors to train its artificial intelligence models. The deal follows a sweeping restructure of OpenAI last week which saw it convert away from being a non-profit and changed its relationship with Microsoft to give OpenAI more operational and financial freedom.\"Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,\" said OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman.\"Our partnership with AWS [Amazon Web Services] strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.\"The deal reflects the massive demand for computer power coming from the growing interest in AI - and OpenAI's rush to secure the power it needs.OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, had been reliant on Microsoft for computing power for years. The two firms had an exclusive cloud agreement until January of this year, when their relationship loosened.The AI start-up's first agreement with Amazon's AWS marks its latest shift away from Microsoft toward diversified sources of computing power. \"The deal with AWS shows that OpenAI considers that its path to leadership is paved with getting access to as much computing power as it can get its hands on,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.Microsoft \"taking less of a control stake in the company has allowed relationships with near competitors to OpenAI's funders possible,\" she added.But OpenAI has been unprofitable, as spends big to get ahead in the development of AI technology. Quarterly results from Microsoft last week indicated that OpenAI lost $12bn in just the last quarter.Following the announcement of the deal on Monday, Amazon shares hit an all-time high, adding $140bn (£106bn) to its valuation.AWS is \"uniquely positioned to support OpenAI's vast AI workloads,\" Matt Garman, CEO of AWS, said in a statement.Leading AI firms have been investing in one another, creating a tangled web of deals that has been drawing scrutiny. OpenAI is at the centre of that web.In response to OpenAI's deal spree, there has been some speculation that an AI bubble may be in the offing.Speaking to the BBC last month, Sam Altman said: \"Yes, the investment loans are unprecedented\", but added: \"It's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast.\"Warnings have come from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, as well as from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who told the BBC that \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".",

    "body": "15 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBC/Getty ImagesBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni have been at loggerheads since starring together in It Ends With UsJustin Baldoni's $400m (£295m) lawsuit against his former co-star Blake Lively has been formally ended by a judge, who said the actor and director had failed to meet a deadline to continue his claim.The pair, who starred in the 2024 film It Ends with Us, have been locked in a bitter legal battle since Lively sued Baldoni last December accusing him of sexual harassment and waging a smear campaign against her.In response, he filed a lawsuit against her as well as her husband Ryan Reynolds, their publicist and the New York Times, claiming civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.Baldoni's case was dismissed in June, but he had a chance to file an amended complaint. However, Judge Lewis Liman said he had failed to do.ReutersBaldoni also named Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds in the lawsuitThe judge said he had contacted all of the parties on 17 October to give them warning that he would enter a final judgement to conclude the case.Only Lively responded, asking for the final judgement to be declared, but for her request for legal fees to remain active. The judge agreed.Her original lawsuit against Baldoni is also ongoing.After Baldoni's case was dismissed in June, the actress's lawyers called it \"a total victory and a complete vindication\".At the time, Baldoni's lawyer said Lively's \"predictable declaration of victory is false\", and that \"with the facts on our side, we march forward\".He added: \"While the court dismissed the defamation related claims, the court has invited us to amend four out of the seven claims against Ms Lively, which will showcase additional evidence and refined allegations.\"However, those amended claims were not filed, according to the latest ruling. Baldoni and Wayfarer have not commented.ReutersJustin Baldoni directed and starred in It Ends With Us, based on the Colleen Hoover novelIn June, Judge Liman explained that Baldoni's lawsuit centred on two claims: that Lively \"stole the film\" from him and his production company Wayfarer by threatening not to promote it, and that she and others promoted a false narrative that Baldoni sexually assaulted her and launched a smear campaign against her.But Baldoni and his production company \"have not adequately alleged that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion rather than legally permissible hard bargaining or renegotiation of working conditions\", Judge Liman wrote at that time.Additionally, the judge wrote, Baldoni and his company did not prove defamation because the \"Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements\" in her lawsuit, which are privileged.The judge also determined that evidence did not show that the New York Times \"acted with actual malice\" in publishing their story, dismissing that $250m suit as well.\"The alleged facts indicate that the Times reviewed the available evidence and reported, perhaps in a dramatised manner, what it believed to have happened,\" he wrote. \"The Times had no obvious motive to favour Lively's version of events.\"",

    "body": "Drones have been seen flying over a Belgian military base near the Dutch border for a third night in a row, according to the country's defence minister said.A helicopter was deployed to the Kleine-Brogel base after drones were spotted - they then flew off towards the Netherlands, national broadcaster VRT reported.Defence Minister Theo Francken said an investigation was under way, calling it \"a clear mission targeting Kleine Broge\".Francken told Belgian radio on Monday that it looked like an espionage operation, but said he would not speculate on who could be behind it.\"I have some ideas, but I'm going to be cautious,\" he added.Drones were also spotted flying above other military air bases - the Leopoldsburg, in central Limburg province, and Marche-en-Famenne in the south-east of the country.  VRT reported over the weekend that drones were also seen close to coastal Ostend and Antwerp's Deurne airports.It marks the latest incident involving drones disrupting European airspace in recent months. In October, unconfirmed drone sightings forced Germany's Munich airport to suspend operations twice in 24 hours.The month before, Denmark said drones flown over its airports appeared to be the work of a \"professional actor\".At the time, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said there was no evidence to suggest Russia was behind the incursion.The Russian embassy in Copenhagen denied \"absurd speculations\" of its involvement.Also in September, Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members, after around 20 Russian drones crossed into Poland and Russian MiG31 jets entered Estonian airspace.Russia denied violating Estonia's airspace and insisted the Polish incursion was not deliberate.The European Commission has since proposed four defence projects, including a counter-drone system, as part of plans to get the continent ready to defend itself by 2030.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump's administration has said it will provide reduced food aid to more than 42 million Americans, as the government shutdown this week heads towards becoming the longest ever with no resolution in sight. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in a court filing that Americans who receive food assistance will get half their normal monthly allotment, after the government dipped into emergency funding. Judges had given the Trump administration until Monday to provide a plan for how it would pay out Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits, also known as food stamps.Funding for the programme has been in limbo due to the more-than-month-long shutdown.While individual US states administer the benefits, the programme relies on money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October.States will get clarity on how they are to distribute the reduced funds by the end of the day on Monday. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled that the USDA needs to use $5.25bn (£4bn) in emergency funds to make at least partial payments to Americans on Snap.Snap costs about $8bn per month. 'I have to get what I need right now': Americans brace for expiry of critical food benefitsTrump administration must continue food aid during shutdown, US judges sayFive ways US government shutdown is hurting - and why it's about to get worseThe judges both said the Trump administration could use the money set aside for contingencies to provide the benefits. President Trump previously said he had instructed government lawyers to ask the courts how the administration could legally fund Snap, adding: \"Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed.\"On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a CNN interview that the president wanted to hear from the courts about how to legally move money around to fund Snap payments, but they could go out as soon as Wednesday.\"There's a process that has to be followed,\" Bessent said. \"So, we've got to figure out what the process is.\"Late last month, the USDA said it would not distribute food-assistance funds starting 01 November because of the shutdown, saying: \"The well has run dry.\"Half the states and the District of Columbia sued the administration over the food-aid freeze and argued that they had a legal obligation to keep the programme running in their jurisdictions. Separately, cities and non-profits also filed a lawsuit. Some states said they would use their own money to fund Snap benefits. Snap allows many low-income Americans to buy groceries. It provides them reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy food.A family of four on average receives $715 per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 per day, per person.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Southern Europe correspondent, Rome and Jake LaphamA worker who was trapped after part of a medieval tower collapsed in the heart of Rome has been rescued, according to local media reports. The man was pulled free at 23:00 local time (22:00 GMT) - nearly twelve hours after a section of the Torre dei Conti, on the edge of the famous Roman Forum and close to the Colosseum, gave way and trapped him beneath. He has been taken to hospital. The Romanian foreign ministry said the trapped man was from Romania, as was another worker who was among three others pulled from the rubble. One is said to be in a critical condition.The tower has been closed to the public for many years, and was undergoing conservation work when a section collapsed.Talking of the rescued worker, Rome mayor Roberto Gualtieri said: \"We hope that he will pull through.\"Rome prefect Lamberto Giannini told reporters the worker was pulled from the rubble after \"a long rescue mission\".Earlier he had described it as a \"very complex situation\". Giannini said that after the initial collapse firefighters had \"put up some protection\" around the trapped man, so when the second collapse happened, \"they obviously shielded him\".He added that the rescue would be a long operation due to having to \"mitigate...the enormous risks faced by the people trying to carry out the rescue\".The Rome Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into the incident. Efforts to rescue the worker - reported to be in his 60s - were interrupted when a second section of the 29m (90ft) high tower began crumbling again, with bricks raining down, creating a huge cloud of dust.One firefighter was taken to hospital with an eye problem, according to local media, but the rest were unharmed, eventually resuming their search for the man.A police chief said there was no imminent danger that the tower will disintegrate. \"My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life beneath the rubble, and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy finds a positive outcome,\" wrote Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on X before the rescue was complete.Another worker, 67-year-old Ottaviano, who was inside at the time of the collapse but escaped from a balcony uninjured, told the AFP news agency: \"It was not safe. I just want to go home.\"Rome's mayor and the country's culture minister visited the scene. A crane and drone are also being used to assist with the rescue operation.The 13th Century tower is part of the Roman Forum, a major tourist attraction right in the heart of the city, but it is separated from the main visitors' area by a road. The streets all around have been taped off by police as a precaution.The medieval tower was built by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his brother.",

    "body": "The Maldives has banned young people born on or after 1 January 2007 from smoking tobacco, becoming the only country in the world to enforce a nationwide generational tobacco prohibition.The archipelago's health ministry announced on Saturday that it would be illegal for younger generations to use, buy or sell tobacco within the country.The ban \"reflects the government's strong commitment to protecting young people from the harms of tobacco\", the ministry said. Ahmed Afaal, vice chair of the archipelago's tobacco control board, told BBC World Service's Newshour programme that the country's general vaping ban last year had been a \"good step towards a generation of tobacco-free citizens\". The new ban \"applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale\", the health ministry said, adding that it aligned with the Maldives' obligations under the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.According to the UN's health body, this convention \"provides a global response to a global problem – namely, the tobacco epidemic\".Mr Afaal said the country's crackdown on vaping had been an important first step because \"these new stylish gadgets are tactics of the industry to approach the younger generations to uptake addictive processes, which definitely harms their health\".Last year, the Maldives made it illegal for anyone to import, sell, possess, use or distribute electronic cigarettes and vaping products, regardless of age.Tourists coming to visit the Maldives' islands will also have to adhere to the law, but Mr Afaal argues the smoking ban will not have a detrimental impact on tourism.\"People don't come to the Maldives because they're able to smoke. They come for the beaches, they come for the sea, they come for the sun, and they come for the fresh air,\" he added.Quoting tourism data, Mr Afaal argued that despite the new regulations there had been no tourist cancellations and the number of arrivals had grown in the past year.\"We're projecting more than 2m [tourists] in the next year,\" he said. Plans by New Zealand to pass a generational smoking ban were scrapped in 2023 after a new government took power.The move was seen as a blow to many health experts and Māori people in particular, who have one of the highest smoking rates.Last year, the UK's then-Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, had hoped to introduce a law that would ban young people born on or after 2009 from smoking.A new version of the legislation, introduced by the current government, has passed through the Commons and is now at the committee stage at the House of Lords - nearing its last hurdles before it gets royal assent.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondentAn investigation into allegations that Sheffield Hallam University faced sustained pressure from China to shut down human rights research has been referred to counter-terrorism police.The BBC and the Guardian newspaper has been reporting that documents show that China had waged a two-year campaign of intimidation and harassment, including demands the university stop sensitive research by one of its professors into claims of forced labour in the Xinjiang region of China.A South Yorkshire Police spokesperson said the force has referred the investigation on because the \"allegations fall under Section 3 of the National Security Act\".Section 3 of the act deals with \"assisting a foreign intelligence service\".An offence is committed if someone behaves in a way that \"intends that conduct to materially assist a foreign intelligence service in carrying out UK-related activities,\" or in conduct likely to assist that service.Internal documents from Sheffield Hallam University were released under a Subject Access Request to Professor Laura Murphy, whose research is alleged to have been targeted.They showed university staff in China had been threatened by individuals identified as being from China's National Security Service, who demanded the research by Prof Murphy taking place in Sheffield be shut down.The documents went on to state that \"a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service... Immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed\".China is not believed to have an organisation named National Security Service, so it is not clear who the individuals were.A few months later, at the start of this year, Prof Murphy was told by the university that she could not continue her work on China. She started legal action for infringement of her academic freedom. The university then reversed its position. In a statement issued earlier, Sheffield Hallam University had apologised to Prof Murphy.A spokesperson said: \"The University's decision to not continue with Professor Laura Murphy's research was taken based on our understanding of a complex set of circumstances at the time, including being unable to secure the necessary professional indemnity insurance.\"The insurance for social sciences staff had been suspended by the university's insurers as a Chinese firm had brought a defamation suit against Sheffield Hallam after it was named in a report she produced. That lawsuit is ongoing.The university spokesperson added: \"Following a review, we have since approved Professor Murphy's latest research and are committed to supporting her to undertake and disseminate this important work.\"For the avoidance of doubt, the decision was not based on commercial interests in China. \"Regardless, China is not a significant international student market for the University.\"We have apologised to Professor Murphy and wish to make clear our commitment to supporting her research and to securing and promoting freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "17 hours agoKoh Ewe and Mahfouz Zubaide,BBC ProducerAfghans dig through rubble after earthquake destroys housesAt least 20 people have died after an earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, local authorities say, with the toll expected to rise as rescue efforts continue. Hundreds have also been left injured, local officials told the BBC.The earthquake struck near Mazar-e-Sharif, one of the country's largest cities that is home to about 500,000 people, at around 01:00 local time on Monday, (20:30 GMT on Sunday).It had a magnitude of 6.3 and a depth of 28km (17 miles), according to the US Geological Survey, and was marked at the orange alert level, which indicates \"significant casualties\" are likely. More than 530 people have been injured, according to the Taliban government health ministry.Provincial officials earlier told the BBC that casualties were likely to rise as rescue efforts continued.Getty ImagesAuthorities expect the death toll to rise as search and rescue efforts continueHaji Zaid, a Taliban spokesman in Balkh province wrote earlier on X that \"many people are injured\" in the Sholgara district, south of Mazar-e- Sharif. He said they had received \"reports of minor injuries and superficial damages from all districts of the province\". \"Most of the injuries were caused by people falling from tall buildings,\" he wrote.Many of Mazar-e Sharif's residents rushed to the streets when the quake struck, as they feared their houses would collapse, AFP news agency reported.The quake led to a power outage across the country including in the capital city Kabul, after electricity lines from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan - major suppliers of power to Afghanistan - were damaged. The Taliban spokesman in Balkh also posted a video on X appearing to show debris strewn across the ground at the Blue Mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif, revered by Shia Muslims.The mosque, built in the 15th Century, is believed to house the tomb of the first Shia Imam, the son-in-law and cousin of Prophet Mohamad. It is now a site where pilgrims gather to pray and celebrate religious events.Khalid Zadran, a Taliban spokesman for the police in Kabul, wrote on X that police are \"closely monitoring the situation\". Numerous fatalities were also reported in Samangan, a mountainous province near Mazar-e-Sharif, according to its spokesman. The quake on Monday comes after a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan's mountainous eastern region in late August, killing more than 1,100 people.That earthquake was especially deadly as the rural houses in the region were typically made of mud and timber. Residents were trapped when their houses collapsed during the quake.Afghanistan is very prone to earthquakes because of its location on top of a number of fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.Poor communication networks and infrastructure - buildings there are not earthquake-resistant, for example - have often hampered rescue efforts following disasters like this.",

    "body": "Popular Malaysian rapper Namewee has been charged with illegal drug use and possession, local media reported on Monday, quoting Kuala Lumpur police.Namewee, who pleaded not guilty to both charges, has been released on bail after being arrested last month, authorities said.The 42-year-old is known for his satirical songs and music videos about taboo topics in Malaysia, from obscenity to religion to China's censorship.In an Instagram post on Sunday, Namewee denied using or carrying drugs.\"The truth will be out when the police report is released,\" he wrote.Kuala Lumpur police chief Fadil Marsus said that Namewee was arrested on 22 October in a hotel room, where they found pills believed to be ecstasy - also known as MDMA.Namewee later tested positive for illicit substances - including amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine, and THC - and was remanded for two days, Fadil said in a statement.If convicted of drug possession, he could be jailed up to five years and caned.A police official told local media that Namewee had been in the same hotel at the same time as Iris Hsieh, a Taiwanese influencer who was found dead in her hotel room bathtub.Namewee wrote on Instagram that he felt \"deeply sorry\" about Hsieh's death. The ambulance had taken \"nearly an hour\" to arrive at the scene, he wrote.He said that he had remained silent as the case was under investigation - though it's unclear if he's referring to his drug charges or Hsieh's death.He also claimed that he has received \"blackmail\" in recent days but would \"fight to the end\".Namewee has long courted controversy with his music.In 2016 he was arrested in Malaysia for his music video Oh My God, which was filmed at various places of worship around the country. Critics said the song insulted religious sensitivities.In 2021, he released the song Fragile, which poked fun at Chinese nationalists and touched on politically sensitive topics like the sovereignty of Taiwan and the persecution of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. The song went viral for Mandarin-speaking audiences but was banned by China.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNicolas Négoce,BBC Africa and Natasha BootyThe military commander who has ruled Guinea since a coup four years ago has entered the presidential race, breaking an earlier promise to hand power to a civilian government.Col Mamadi Doumbouya submitted his candidacy at the Supreme Court on Monday, flanked by soldiers and wearing black sunglasses. He did not make any public comment.Two of Guinea's biggest opposition parties  - RPG Arc en Ciel and UFDG - have been excluded from December's contest.This has raised concerns about the election's credibility.Guineans had reacted with shock last month when it was announced that presidential candidates would need to pay a deposit of 875m Guinean francs ($100,000; £75,000) to contest the election.While the previous deposit was almost as high - 800m francs - some analysts had hoped it would be reduced to encourage more people to stand in these historic elections.‎Four years ago, Col Doumbouya had pledged to hand power back to civilians, saying  \"Neither I nor any member of this transition will be a candidate for anything... As soldiers, we value our word very much.\" ‎‎The election is being held under a new constitution that allowed Col Doumbouya to run for the presidency.Under his rule, the Guinean authorities have been cracking down on peaceful dissent, including attempts to mobilise people towards a return to democratic rule.The junta has been criticised for suspending media outlets, restricting internet access and brutally suppressing demonstrations.Yet Col Doumbouya justified deposing then-83-year-old President Alpha Condé on similar charges - including rampant corruption, disregard for human rights and economic mismanagement.Prior to seizing power in the 2021 coup, Col Doumbouya was a middle-ranking soldier. His 15-year military career included missions in Afghanistan, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Central African Republic and close protection in Israel, Cyprus, the UK and Guinea.Aged 40, he is currently the youngest African head of state.December's election will take place in the absence of several prominent figures - such as ex-President Alpha Condé who was kicked out of power in 2021, and former Prime Ministers Cellou Dalein Diallo and Sidya Touré - all of whom are currently living abroad.

And can you imagine the children who are in the epicentre of it? It feels like you're in the Middle Ages.\"Winds of up to 185mph (295 km/h) caused at least 28 deaths. Paul and his family were in the capital Kingston, while areas further west suffered the greatest damage.ReutersThe singer said: \"It is really difficult to bear. We weren't hit in Kingston very hard, but it was frightening. And you're wondering, at any minute now is there going to be, you know, some tree that comes along and slaps your roof off?\"That happened to friends of mine in Montego Bay. They've lost their whole roof, and they're still in the trenches helping people there, making sure that food reaches and clothes reach [people]. Everybody's stuff is all muddied up and it's hard to think about something positive at this time.\"Paul has pledged $50,000 (£38,000) to match donations to Food For The Poor Jamaica, and described the devastation as \"a very mind-blowing situation\".\"After days and days of communication and trying to help out in different ways, on Saturday I broke down,\" he said.\"It's just the amount of energy it takes, and the depression that starts to set in, and then you have to shake yourself out of it because there's just so much to be done that we haven't even tipped the iceberg yet.\"He continued: \"It is overwhelming. I myself took a drive to the country yesterday, the countryside of St Mary, which was not hit as hard, but still hit. They don't have light yet, and a lot of people out there can't even see the rest of what's happening, because once they get charge on their phone, they're just trying to call loved ones to make sure that they're OK.\"Some people \"don't even know that people are helping them, because a lot of the time they're not able to see these videos of people preparing stuff to send out there\", he said.\"And so little has been actually distributed... There's still blocked areas, roads that are damaged.\"I just heard a story of 15 babies that were under three months old, but they're sleeping in cardboard boxes right now. So it's a terrible situation, and we're trying to get help out there as much as possible.\"'Breaks my heart'Getty ImagesFellow Jamaican music star, Shaggy, has also been co-ordinating aid efforts on the island, bringing essentials to locals via small convoys. Asked how he felt about what had happened, he said: \"Devastated. I don't think I can unsee what I've seen... It's rough, there's a lot of aid coming in. \"Nobody could really prepare for something like that.\"We got into the Black River area, which was hit really hard. Everything is flattened. It breaks my heart. I couldn't help but weep. These are my people.\"He added: \"I've never seen anything like this, it looks like a bomb exploded.\"Sean Paul said: \"Shaggy has reached out to me, a friend of mine in the business, and he is trying to hold a concert in December. It's a long term thing, so we don't want to hold it next week where no one will know about it. It has to be down the road where we can promote it.\"",

    "body": "The US is not planning to conduct nuclear explosions, Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said, calming global concerns after President Donald Trump called on the military to resume weapons testing.\"These are not nuclear explosions,\"  Wright told Fox News on Sunday. \"These are what we call non-critical explosions.\"The comments come days after Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had directed defence officials to \"start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis\" with rival powers.But Wright, whose agency oversees testing, said people living in the Nevada desert should have \"no worries\" about seeing a mushroom cloud.\"Americans near historic test sites such as the Nevada National Security Site have no cause for concern,\" Wright said. \"So you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry, and they set up the nuclear explosion.\" Trump's comments on Truth Social last week were interpreted by many as a sign the US was preparing to restart full-scale nuclear blasts for the first time since 1992.In an interview with 60 Minutes on CBS, which was recorded on Friday and aired on Sunday, Trump reiterated his position.\"I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes,\" Trump said when asked by CBS's Norah O'Donnell if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years.\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" he added.Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996 respectively. Pressed further on the topic, Trump said: \"They don't go and tell you about it.\"\"I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test,\" he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.On Monday, China's foreign ministry denied conducting nuclear weapons tests.As a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always... upheld a self-defence nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing\", spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference in Beijing.She added that China hoped the US would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability\".On Thursday, Russia too denied it had carried out nuclear tests.\"Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists, referencing the names of Russian weapons. \"This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test.\"North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear testing since the 1990s - and even Pyongyang announced a moratorium in 2018.The exact number of nuclear warheads held by each country is kept secret in each case - but Russia is thought to have a total of about 5,459 warheads while the US has about 5,177, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).The US-based ACA gives slightly higher estimates, saying America's nuclear stockpile sits at about 5,225 warheads, while Russia has approximately 5,580.China is the world's third largest nuclear power with about 600 warheads, France has 290, the United Kingdom 225, India 180, Pakistan 170, Israel 90 and North Korea 50, the FAS says.According to US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China has roughly doubled its nuclear arsenal in the past five years and is expected to exceed 1,000 weapons by 2030.",

    "body": "The president of Spain's Valencia region, Carlos Mazón, has resigned after months of pressure over his handling of flash floods last year.A total of 229 people died in towns in the Valencia region on 29 October 2024, with a further eight dying in neighbouring regions, in Spain's worst natural disaster for decades.Many in Valencia blamed Mazón for the scale of the tragedy because of how he and his government responded that day. It emerged that the regional president had spent nearly four hours in a restaurant with a journalist, Maribel Vilaplana, while the floodwater was wreaking havoc and he did not attend emergency meetings during much of the day.Mazón's government also failed to issue an emergency alert to the phones of Valencia residents warning them of the floods and providing advice until after 20:00, by which times dozens of people had already died.\"I can't go on anymore... I know that I made mistakes, I acknowledge it and I will live with them for the rest of my life,\" Mazón said as he announced his decision, adding that he should have cancelled his schedule for that day to take charge of the crisis. \"I have said sorry and I say it again, but none of [the mistakes] were due to political calculation or bad faith.\"Polls had shown that the vast majority of people in Valencia wanted Mazón, of the conservative People's Party (PP), to step down because of his management of the floods. Monthly protests were held demanding his resignation, most recently on 25 October, when an estimated 50,000 people turned out on the streets of Valencia. Mazón had been making fewer public appearances in recent months because of the abuse he received from members of the public.However, his insistence on attending the memorial service for victims on the first anniversary of the tragedy last week angered relatives of those who died and a number of them barracked him during the ceremony. Mazón seemed shaken by the experience, which appeared to prompt his decision to resign.His announcement came the same day that Maribel Vilaplana, the journalist with who he had lunch on the day of the floods, testified before a judge who is investigating possible negligence.According to Spanish media reports, Vilaplana told the magistrate that Mazón \"was constantly texting on his phone\" and that at one point he received \"a lot of calls\".Mazón will continue as a member of the regional parliament, meaning he has immunity from prosecution in this case.During his resignation announcement, Mazón criticised the left-wing central government of Pedro Sánchez, accusing it of blocking aid to his region \"purely to cause us political damage\".Mazón has become an increasingly problematic figure for the PP over the last year, with concerns that his unpopularity threatened to undermine the party's electoral prospects not just in the Valencia region but nationwide. However, his replacement has been complicated by the fact that the PP relies on the parliamentary support in the region of the far-right Vox. That party, which has been gaining ground on the PP in polls there, will have to agree to his successor.The leader of the PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, who had spoken with Mazón at length on Sunday to discuss his future and is widely believed to have influenced his decision to resign, welcomed the announcement. He also defended Mazón from the criticism to which he has been subject, saying that \"he is not a murderer\".\"He made mistakes, yes, he also apologised and acknowledged them today, but no national emergency depends on just one person.\"",

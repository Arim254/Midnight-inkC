    "body": "12 minutes agoThomas NaadiBBC Africa, AccraAt least six people have died during a crowd crush at a military recruitment event in a stadium in Ghana.Wednesday's \"tragic\" crush appeared to have been caused by \"an unexpected surge of applicants who breached security protocols and rushed into the gates,\" said a statement from Ghana's armed forces.Twenty-two others were injured, including five who remain in critical condition.Thousands had turned up to El-Wak stadium, in the capital, Accra, with the hope of joining the military.Ghana has a youth unemployment rate of about 32%, the latest government statistics show, and such recruitment events normally draw large crowds and often result in chaotic scenes.The deadline to apply for this event was extended by a week to accommodate more applicants, as some had experienced difficulties in the process.Army spokesperson Capt Veronica Adzo Arhin said the crush occurred ahead of the event's scheduled start of 06:20 GMT.Ghana's President John Mahama has visited the injured in hospital.Despite the deaths, the recruitment exercise did start, but it was suspended in the afternoon \"to allow for additional measures to ensure a seamless exercise\", Capt Arhin said.She added that there would be an investigation into the crush.",

Officials have not confirmed the number of casualties, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier offered his condolences to \"our martyrs\".Search and rescue efforts have begun at the scene. The number on board included flight crew, officials said.The defence ministry said the C-130 cargo plane had been travelling from  Azerbaijan to Turkey. Images from the scene show emergency services on site and what appears to be wreckage from the plane. According to BBC Turkish, Georgia's aviation authority said the aircraft disappeared from radar without issuing a distress signal.Georgia's interior ministry said the plane crashed near Sighnaghi, around 5km (3 miles) from Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said in a message to Erdogan he was \"deeply saddened by the tragic news of the loss of servicemen\", and extended condolences to him and the people of Turkey. The US ambassador to Turkey, Tom Barrack, said on X he was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash.\"We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the fallen, the Turkish Armed Forces, and the people of Türkiye,\" he added.The C-130 is a US-made transport plane used by air forces around the world.",

    "body": "Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of John F. Kennedy, will run for US Congress, he told his supporters on Tuesday. The only grandson to the late former president JFK, Schlossberg, 32, is best known for his provocative and outspoken political commentary online. He is seeking to fill the congressional seat being vacated by New York Representative Jerrold Nadler, who announced in September that he would retire after more than three decades in office.In an interview earlier on Tuesday, the son of the Kennedys' daughter Caroline told the New York Times that he felt his Democratic Party needed more voices to \"push back on perceived abuses of power by President Trump and his allies\".With almost 2 million followers collectively across Instagram and TikTok, the Kennedy heir has been open about his goals to make politics accessible for younger voters. In 2024, he was announced as Vogue's political correspondent in the lead-up to the US election, in part due to what the publication called his \"silly goose\" antics online. He told the magazine that he was inspired by his family's legacy of public service, and said he wanted to contribute \"in my own way\". Naming his grandfather, who was assassinated in 1963, as his hero, Schlossberg told Vogue that JFK's administration was \"a blueprint for how progressivism can work in America\". Shortly after announcing his campaign, Schlossberg shared a series of videos and links to his social media accounts, urging his followers to donate \"so we can win\". His campaign website declares a \"new generation of leadership\" for New York, and makes \"12 promises to the people of New York's 12th district\". \"This is our last chance to stop Trump - it won't come again,\" it reads.Schlossberg has been vocal about his opposition to the Trump administration, which includes his estranged cousin Robert F Kennedy Jr. Despite being a relative, he is especially critical of the US health secretary, whom he has called a \"loser\". Schlossberg's decision comes as Democrats are hoping to regain control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections.\"There is nothing our party can't do to address costs of living, corruption and the constitutional crisis that we're in,\" he told the New York Times on Tuesday. \"But without the control of Congress, there's almost nothing that we can do.\"Schlossberg has been hinting for months at his possible run for the seat. A number of other Democrats have also announced campaigns for NY-12, including state assemblymen Micah Lasher and Alex Bores, and veteran journalist Jami Floyd. Newly elected New York City mayor and fellow millennial Zohran Mamdani has not yet endorsed a candidate in the primary.",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 7 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "'This animal spared my life': Biologist bitten in head by shark hopes to meet it again1 day agoRafael AbuchaibeBBC News MundoMauricio HoyosMauricio Hoyos has spent 30 years studying the behaviour of different shark speciesMauricio Hoyos still remembers the pressure that the jaws of a female Galapagos shark, over 3m (10ft) in length, exerted on his skull.The animal had lunged at him with astonishing speed, giving him barely enough time to duck his head in a last ditch effort to protect his jugular vein.\"When it closed its jaw, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then, after what I think was a second, it opened it again and it let me go,\" Hoyos told BBC Mundo from his home in Baja California, Mexico, a little over month after surviving the incident.Hoyos, a marine biologist with over 30 years of experience studying sharks in their natural habitat, was on a research trip in Costa Rica when he was attacked by the shark in September.Less than two months on, and still bearing the scars from the attack on his face, he describes his recovery as \"incredible\" - and says he even hopes to encounter his assailant again.Hoyos calls the shark bite \"a battle scar that looks like gills\"For Hoyos, what happened to him that day in the waters off Cocos Island is the result of normal animal behaviour when confronted with a perceived threat. \"In this case, this bite was like a dog's,\" he says.\"Have you ever seen how dogs, when another dog gets too close, throw a quick bite? It doesn't hurt it, but it calms the other dog down.\"Hoyos - who along with his colleagues attaches acoustic tags to sharks to help pinpoint their mating and spawning grounds as part of his work - was alerted to the shark's presence in the water by tourists.It was at a depth of 40m, and Hoyos told the captain of the boat he was on that he would be there \"for a maximum of five minutes\".He then entered the water and began his slow descent.Getty ImagesGalapagos sharks can grow 3m in lengthHoyos recalls encountering the shark: \"This giant female, measuring between 3 and 3.5m (11.5ft), swam by and headed toward the bottom, and I positioned myself to tag her at the base of her dorsal fin.\"But Hoyos, who has tagged many kinds of sharks in his decades-long career, says this animal reacted differently to others.\"Obviously the tip - the metal tip attached to the cable hanging from the probe - goes in, and unlike the other sharks I've tagged that immediately flee, she turns around and stares at me,\" he recalls.\"I saw her little eye looking at me, and I saw her very calmly turning around.\"Hoyos and his colleagues tag sharks with probes like this oneHoyos says he held the shark's gaze as it swam away - but then, suddenly, out of nowhere, it lunged at him.\"I lowered my head, and what I felt was its lower jaw digging into my cheek and its upper jaw into my head. I was there, I imagine for a second, no more, inside its jaw, and then it simply opened it again.\"\"When it closed it, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then it just let me go,\" he marvels.The Galapagos shark's 29 serrated teeth not only left Hoyos with deep wounds to his face and head, but also severed the air line of his diving apparatus.He had survived the shark attack but was still in mortal danger.In addition, one of the teeth had torn his diving mask, and the blood-tinged water was further blurring his already limited visibility.\"When I realised that no air was coming out of the hose, I grabbed a second one we have, which we call an octopus, that is used to give air to someone else if they need it,\" he tells BBC Mundo. \"But then I realised that the regulator wasn't working and was blowing air instead of regulating it, so I had to remember my training and start regulating it with my lips.\"Bleeding, blinded, and with the air escaping, Hoyos calculated that he had less than a minute to reach the surface.\"Since I couldn't see anything, what I did was look for the light that I knew was the surface. I started swimming upwards, in a very coordinated manner, because I wanted to avoid erratic movements that would attract the shark.\"Mauricio HoyosHoyos had to use all the lessons he had learned during years of diving to survive the attackAfter Hoyos reached the surface, a young man pulled him aboard the boat, and when the captain saw his condition, he called the park ranger station to report the incident.Hoyos explained that he didn't feel the pain of his injuries until much later.\"Obviously, I had adrenaline in my system, but the bite didn't hurt that much. What hurt the most was the impact: when the shark bit me - an animal 3m long and at that speed - it was like being hit by a car. In fact, I ended up with a huge bruise all over my jaw; I thought it was broken.\"When they docked, a team of paramedics was ready to provide him with emergency care.Hoyos was lucky: as well as surviving the attack and the subsequent ascent, none of his wounds became infected, and the healing process took less time than anyone could have imagined.\"The doctors told me it was amazing: the attack happened on 27 [September], I had a 34-hour trip, they performed a surgical debridement [removing damaged tissue], and two days later they were already evaluating whether they could perform reconstructive surgery.\"It could have been far worse for Hoyos. According to the doctors, a young man who survived a Galapagos shark attack in the same area in 2017 had to remain in a hyperbaric chamber for almost a month because his wounds weren't healing properly.\"They told me my recovery had been incredible. After the surgery, the doctors confessed how worried they had been about an infection, because being on my face, it was a direct path to the brain.\"Mauricio HoyosSmiling broadly, Hoyos adds that he is already planning to get back into the water and has a diving trip booked for 14 November.And he says that after having survived an attack of this magnitude he has even more respect for the animals he studies.\"Many people think the oceans would be better off without sharks, but they really say that because they don't understand the crucial role sharks play in maintaining their delicate balance.\"Pointing to the large scar on his cheek, he says: \"This is the proof that this female spared my life; I can't put it any other way. And this will allow me to continue speaking well of sharks and advocating for their conservation in the future.\"Meanwhile, the Galapagos shark that had Hoyos in its jaws continues its natural life in the depths, and he hopes to see it again. And since he was able to mark it before it attacked him, that possibility exists.\"In January I'm going to Cocos Island, we have a trip from the 20 to 27. And obviously I'm going to Roca Sucia [where the attack happened], I'm going to dive down there,\" he says, undeterred.",

    "body": "Scientists have unearthed Australia's oldest known crocodile eggshells which may have belonged to \"drop crocs\" - creatures that climbed trees to hunt prey below.The discovery of the 55-million-year-old eggshells was made in a sheep farmer's backyard in Queensland with the findings published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.The egghells belonged to a long-extinct group of crocodiles known as mekosuchines, who lived in inland waters when Australia was part of Antarctica and South America.Co-author Prof Michael Archer said \"drop crocs\" were a \"bizarre idea\" but some were \"perhaps hunting like leopards - dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner\".Prof Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales, said mekosuchine crocodiles - which could grow to about five metres - were plentiful 55 million years ago, long before their modern saltwater and freshwater cousins arrived in Australia about 3.8 million years ago.The \"drop croc\" eggshells were discovered several decades ago but only recently analysed with the help of scientists in Spain.\"It's a bizarre idea,\" Prof Archer said of the \"drop crocs\",  but some were probably \"terrestrial hunters in the forests\".The findings add to earlier discoveries of younger mekosuchine fossils - found in 25-million-year-old deposits in another part of Queensland.\"Some were also apparently at least partly semi-arboreal 'drop crocs',\" Prof Archer said.Since the early 1980s, he has been part of a group of scientists excavating a clay pit in Murgon, a small regional town about 270km (168 miles) north-west of Brisbane.Over the decades, it has become known as one of Australia's oldest fossil sites as it used to be surrounded by a lush forest. \"This forest was also home to the world's oldest-known songbirds, Australia's earliest frogs and snakes, a wide range of small mammals with South American links, as well as one of the world's oldest known bats,\" Dr Michael Stein, a co-author of the report, said.Prof Archer recalls how in 1983, he and another colleague \"drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard\".\"After explaining the prehistoric treasures that might lie under their sheep paddock and that fossil turtle shells had already been found in the area, they grinned and said 'of course!'.\"And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we've already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseA US naval strike force centred around the world's largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, has arrived in the Caribbean, the US Navy has confirmed. The arrival of the strike group, which was ordered to the region by President Donald Trump last month, comes amid ongoing strikes against alleged drug boats and tensions with Venezuela. The US has so far carried out at least 19 strikes against boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, killing at least 76 people. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials have accused the US of \"fabricating\" a crisis and seeking to topple the country's left-wing socialist government. The aircraft carrier movement also comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\".Petro on Tuesday ordered his country's public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US agencies until the boat attacks in the Caribbean stop.He wrote on X that the fight against drugs \"must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".In a statement, the US Navy said that the strike group entered the area of responsibility of US Southern Command - which oversees Latin America and the Caribbean - on 11 November. The force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which itself includes more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of aircraft. The strike force also includes guided-missile destroyers and various other vessels. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the force will \"bolster US capacity to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit actors and activities that disrupt the safety and prosperity\" of the US and will help \"disrupt narcotics trafficking\" and criminal groups in the region. The carrier group is joining substantial military forces already deployed in the region, including thousands of troops, a nuclear-powered submarine and military aircraft based in Puerto Rico. Collectively, they form the largest US presence arrayed in and around Latin America in decades. The US has continued to launch strikes on alleged drug boats in the region. The Trump administration says the attacks are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US. Earlier this week, the US announced it had conducted two additional strikes in the Pacific, killing six people. In addition to fueling tensions with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela, the strikes have led to concerns from some observers about violations of human rights and due process. Colombia's Petro has also faced criticism as well as US sanctions over his reluctant response to drug-trafficking groups. On Tuesday, Colombia's military officers revealed that they had launched their own deadly airstrikes against a drug-running guerrilla group in the Amazon region, killing 19, AFP reported.Earlier in November, Trump downplayed suggestions he was planning to topple the Venezuelan government or start a war. In an interview with CBS - the BBC's US news partner - Trump said that \"every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\" ",

    "body": "23 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad and Dearbail JordanPakistan: Suicide attack outside Islamabad court kills 12A suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad has killed 12 people and injured at least 27 others, the country's interior minister said.Mohsin Naqvi said a bomber was planning to attack the district courthouse but was unable to get inside.Naqvi said authorities would prioritise identifying the bomber, and that those involved would be brought to justice.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that extremist groups \"actively backed by India\" were involved.A spokesperson for the Indian government denied what they described as \"baseless and unfounded allegations\".In a statement, Sharif said that \"terrorist attacks on unarmed citizens of Pakistan by India's terrorist proxies are condemnable\".Jumaat Ul Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), has claimed responsibility, according to local media. But two local journalists have told the BBC that the TTP's central leadership has sent messages to them saying it has no link to the explosion.Suicide blasts in Islamabad have been rare in recent years. Footage from the scene on Tuesday showed the remains of a burnt-out car and a police cordon in place.The 27 people injured are receiving medical treatment, Naqvi said.He added that the attacker detonated the bomb close to a police car after waiting for up to 15 minutes. Footage of the aftermath showed plumes of smoke rising from a charred vehicle behind a security barrier. The incident occurred at 12:39 local time (07:39 GMT).Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said he \"strongly condemned the suicide blast\". A lawyer who said he was parking his car outside the court at the time described hearing a \"loud bang\".Rustam Malik told AFP news agency \"it was complete chaos\".\"Lawyers and people were running inside the complex,\" he added. \"I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate and several cars were on fire.\"Police cordoned off an area close to a district court in Islamabad after the blastIn a separate incident on Monday, a car exploded in India's capital Delhi, killing eight people and injuring a number of others. The Indian government has not called the incident a terror attack, although the case has been referred to the country's anti-terror body.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said following the attack: \"The conspirators behind this heinous act will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice, no matter how deep the conspiracy runs.\"There is, however, no official word yet on what led to the blast.The last time Pakistan's capital was targeted by a suicide bombing was three years ago when a police officer was killed and several others injured.There have been suicide attacks in other parts of the country in the years since but not in Islamabad.

    "body": "Ancient statues and other artefacts have been stolen from Syria's National Museum in Damascus, officials say.The theft was discovered on Monday, when staff reportedly found that one of the museum's doors had been broken from the inside.The six missing statues were made of marble and dated back to the Roman era, one official told the Associated Press.Syria's Directorate-General for Antiquities and Museums said it had opened an investigation to determine the \"circumstances surrounding the loss of a number of exhibits\", and that measures had been taken to strengthen protection and monitoring systems.The head of internal security in Damascus province, Brig-Gen Osama Atkeh, was cited by the state-run Sana news agency as saying that security forces were investigating the theft, which he said had targeted several \"archaeological statues and rare collectibles\".He added that guards at the museum and other individuals were being questioned.The National Museum, which was established in 1919, houses the most important archaeological collection in Syria.It includes clay cuneiform tablets dating back to the 14th Century BC from Ugarit, where evidence of the oldest known complete alphabet was discovered; 1st and 2nd Century AD Greco-Roman sculptures from Palmyra, one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world; and a 3rd Century AD synagogue that was built at Dura Europos.The museum was forced to close in 2012, one year after the start of the devastating civil war. Most of the collection was evacuated and kept at secret locations to protect them.It reopened partially in 2018 and resumed full operations in January 2025, a month after rebel forces overthrew President Bashar al-Assad.All six of Syria's Unesco World Heritages sites were damaged or partially destroyed during the civil war. The Islamic State group blew up several temples and other structures at Palmyra, claiming that they were idolatrous. Unesco condemned the destruction as a war crime.Many artefacts were also destroyed or looted from archaeological sites and museums.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAbdujalil AbdurasulovIn KyivThick fog has enabled Russian troops to move further into the key strategic city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's 7th Airborne Assault Corps says weather conditions, particularly dense fog, have prompted Moscow to intensify its bid to get increasing numbers into the ruined city and encircle Ukrainian forces.Russian forces have spent more than a year trying to seize the city. Ukraine's military says there may now be 300-500 Russians there and President Voloydymyr Zelensky says the situation remains difficult.Meanwhile, army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi says the situation on the front line in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region has \"significantly worsened\", with the loss of three settlements.Syrskyi said however that Russia was most active around Pokrovsk. A video has gone viral on social media showing Russian soldiers openly driving through a hazy road on civilian cars and motorbikes.The BBC has verified the location where the video was filmed as the southern outskirts of the town on the Selidove-Pokrovsk highway.For several days fog obscured visibility to carry out aerial reconnaissance, says a drone pilot from the \"Shershni Dovbusha\" unit of the 68th brigade with the call-sign \"Goose\".That's why, he told the BBC, the Russians had even \"dared\" to launch assaults using a column of vehicles, which would normally have been wiped out immediately by Ukrainian drones.The Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC his unit had regularly detected and eliminated small Russian groups trying to advance on foot and on motor bikes.  He added they were also involved in repelling the attack featured in the viral video, said to have been filmed on Sunday.The convoy was partly destroyed, \"Goose\" claims, however weather conditions meant there was no video monitoring of the moment they repelled the attack so he was not sure if the entire group was hit.A week ago, Zelensky estimated that up to 300 Russian soldiers were fighting in Pokrovsk. The video suggests those numbers have probably increased in that time and the military confirmed that on Wednesday, with southern areas of the city now under Russian occupation.Russian troops appear to be closing in on most areas of Pokrovsk, according to mapping by the Ukraine-based DeepState monitoring group. Some observers say that its fall is imminent.Most parts of the city are now in a grey zone that neither side fully controls, says \"Goose\". \"We might hold positions in one building, but the enemy can be in the next one. They're trying to get behind our backs,\" he says.Moscow is trying to encircle Pokrovsk and neighbouring Myrnohrad in what is known as a \"cauldron\".  Even if the \"lid\" is not closed, Russians can constantly target all routes in and out of it using FPV drones.To prevent such an encirclement, Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian troops back from Suvorove and Rodynske on the eastern part of the \"cauldron\", creating a bigger gap between Russian flanks.Russian forces are trying to cut off logistical routes supporting Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk.  They attack supply routes, not only remotely using drones and artillery but also by sending in soldiers on the ground, the Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC.This tactic is called infiltration and it has proved quite successful, says Ukrainian military analyst Kostyantyn Mashovets.He argues that Russian forces have specifically targeted Ukrainian FPV pilots so they do not have sufficient resources to detect the movement of smaller Russian groups.  In an urban environment, Russian soldiers sometimes infiltrate by dressing up as locals or as Ukrainian military, says Mashovets.  Their main goal is to cause chaos among Ukrainian defenders, which is then followed by a push from the main forces of the Russian army, he adds.The Kremlin is also trying to push in other parts of the front line – in Kupyansk in the north-east and in Zapporizhzhya region in the south.Viktor Tregubov, spokesperson of the Joint Forces Operation, denied Moscow's claim that they had managed to surround Kupyansk but admitted that Russian troops were present in the south of the town and the situation was difficult.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSarah RainsfordEastern and Southern Europe correspondentAP Photo/Jerome DelayCivilians risked their lives to cross Sarajevo's main boulevard during the Bosnian warThe public prosecutor's office in Milan has opened an investigation into claims that Italian citizens travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina on \"sniper safaris\" during the war in the early 1990s.Italians and others are alleged to have paid large sums to shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo.The Milan complaint was filed by journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni, who describes a \"manhunt\" by \"very wealthy people\" with a passion for weapons who \"paid to be able to kill defenceless civilians\" from Serb positions in the hills around Sarajevo.Different rates were charged to kill men, women or children, according to some reports.More than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo.Yugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.Similar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years, but the evidence gathered by Gavazzeni, which includes the testimony of a Bosnian military intelligence officer, is now being examined by Italian counter terrorism prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis.The charge is murder.CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFPMore than 11,000 civilians died in the three-year siege of SarajevoThe Bosnian officer apparently revealed that his Bosnian colleagues found out about the so-called safaris in late 1993 and then passed on the information to Italy's Sismi military intelligence in early 1994.The response from Sismi came a couple of months later. They found out that \"safari\" tourists would fly from the northern Italian border city of Trieste and then travel to the hills above Sarajevo.\"We've put a stop to it and there won't be any more safaris,\" the officer was told. Within two to three months the trips had stopped.Ezio Gavazzeni, who usually writes about terrorism and the mafia, first read about the sniper tours to Sarajevo three decades ago when Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the story, but without firm evidence.He returned to the topic after seeing \"Sarajevo Safari\", a documentary film from 2022 by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic which alleges that those involved in the killings came from several countries, including the US and Russia as well as Italy.Gavazzeni began to dig further and in February handed prosecutors his findings, said to amount to a 17-page file including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic.MICHAEL EVSTAFIEV/AFPSnipers would shoot at civilians from areas controlled by the Bosnian Serbs overlooking SarajevoAn investigation in Bosnia itself appears to have stalled.Speaking to Italy's La Repubblica newspaper, Gavazzeni alleges that \"many\" took part in the practice, \"at least a hundred\" in all, with Italians paying \"a lot of money\" to do so, up to €100,000 (£88,000) in today's terms.In 1992, late Russian nationalist writer and politician Eduard Limonov was filmed firing multiple rounds into Sarajevo from a heavy machine gun. He was being given a tour of hillside positions by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was later convicted of genocide by an international tribunal in the Hague. Limonov didn't pay for his war tourism, though. He was there as an admirer of Karadzic, telling the so-called Butcher of Bosnia: \"We Russians should take example from you.\"The fact Milan prosecutors had opened a case was first reported back in July when Il Giornale website wrote that the Italians would arrive in the mountains by minivan, paying huge bribes to pass checkpoints as they went, pretending to be on a humanitarian mission.After a weekend shooting in the war zone, they would return home to their normal lives.Gavazzeni described their actions as the \"indifference of evil\".Prosecutors and police are said to have identified a list of witnesses as they try to establish who might have been involved.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKhanyisile Ngcobo and Pumza Fihlani,Southern Africa correspondent, JohannesburgTwo brothers have been charged with the murder of South African rapper Kiernan Forbes, popularly known as \"AKA\", following their extradition from neighbouring Eswatini.Siyabonga and Malusi Ndimande were brought back to the country after the failure of a lengthy legal attempt to block their return.Forbes, an award-winning hip-hop artist, was killed outside a restaurant in the coastal city of Durban in 2023 along with his close friend, celebrity chef Tebello \"Tibz\" Motsoane.South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world but this shooting shocked the country.The brothers have also been charged with Motsoane's murder and will appear alongside five other accused already in custody when the trial begins. They also face charges of attempted murder and unlawful possession of a firearm, among others.They have not yet commented on the charges.The pair arrived at Durban's international airport on Tuesday under heavy police guard, with their hands and feet shackled.At the time of his murder, Forbes had been in Durban to perform during his birthday celebrations.Police described the attack on the two men as a coordinated hit. While it is believed that Forbes was the only target and Motsoane was an unintended victim, the motive remains unclear.The authorities believe that one of the Ndimande brothers was \"maybe one of [those who] pulled the trigger and shot AKA,\" police spokesperson Brig Athlenda Mathe told local broadcaster eNCA on Tuesday.The rapper's father Tony told local broadcasters that he was pleased with the progress in the case but still had questions over who ordered his son's murder and the motive.His mother Lynn posted an image of her and her son on Instagram alongside the caption: \"This South African air is suffocating today … I cannot breathe\".Forbes was one of South Africa's most celebrated hip-hop artists after releasing three solo albums.He is also known for his collaborations with other performers, including Nigeria's Burna Boy.The Ndimande brothers will return to court on November 25 for a bail hearing.The case against their co-accused will resume in the high court in Durban next year.",

    "body": "Australia's spy chief says hackers linked to the Chinese government and military are targeting the country's critical infrastructure, warning the country was increasingly at risk of \"high-impact sabotage\". Mike Burgess, head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), said \"unprecedented levels of espionage\" meant a growing threat of \"cyber-enabled sabotage\" in the next five years.He singled out \"one nation state - no prizes for guessing which one - conducting multiple attempts to scan and penetrate critical infrastructure in Australia\" and its allies, \"targeting water, transport, telecommunications, and energy networks\".The Chinese embassy has been contacted for comment.Authoritarian regimes were now more willing to \"disrupt and destroy,\" Burgess warned.He cited two Chinese hacking groups, Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, who have targeted telecommunications companies in the US and Australia. \"These groups are hackers working for Chinese government intelligence and their military,\" he told business leaders at a forum in Melbourne on Wednesday. \"Both groups were involved in the theft of sensitive information, but the real danger was the threat of sabotage - disruption to critical infrastructure.\"He said Salt Typhoon's intent was espionage, breaking into telecommunication networks in the US.\"And they have been probing our telecommunication networks here in Australia too,\" Burgess said. He said Volt Typhoon's actions were intended to be disruptive, with hackers compromising critical infrastructure networks in the US for potential, future sabotage.\"And yes, we have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well,\" Burgess said.He warned that authoritarian regimes are increasingly willing to sabotage critical infrastructure in order to \"impede decision-making, damage the economy, undermine war-fighting capability and sow social discord\". \"I do not think we - and I mean all of us - truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating, this could be,\" he said.Burgess pointed out that short telecommunication outages, unrelated to foreign interference, have had significant and widespread impacts on society.\"That's one phone network not working for less than one day,\" he said.\"Imagine the implications if a nation-state took down all the networks? Or turned off the power during a heatwave? Or polluted our drinking water? Or crippled our financial system?\"Spies are increasingly \"broadening their collection requirements\", Burgess said. \"They are aggressively targeting private sector projects, negotiations and investments that might give foreign companies a commercial advantage. And like criminals, they have been aggressively targeting customer data.\"The spy chief said conservative estimates showed that espionage cost Australia A$12.5bn ($8.2bn; £6.2bn) in 2023-24, with about $2bn worth of trade secrets and intellectual property stolen from Australian companies in one year.Burgess described the hackers' abilities as \"highly sophisticated, using top-notch tradecraft to find your networks, test for vulnerabilities, knock on digital doors and check the digital locks\".\"And when they have penetrated your networks, they actively and aggressively map your systems, and seek to maintain persistent undetected access that enables them to conduct sabotage at a time and moment of their choosing.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiSchools in Delhi have been asked to run hybrid classes for primary students and non-essential construction activity has been banned as air quality worsens in the Indian capital.On Tuesday, authorities enforced stricter anti-pollution measures which include limiting movement of goods carriers in the capital and its suburbs. Delhi's air quality has deteriorated to \"severe\" levels according to authorities, which can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases. On Wednesday, the capital's PM2.5 levels in the air reached 438, according to the Central Pollution Control Board -  dangerously high concentrations of fine particles that can clog the lungs.This is nearly 30 times higher than the World Health Organisation's safe limit and about eight times higher than India's national average. The WHO considers a 24-hour average of no more than 15 to be safe.Doctors have advised people - especially children and the elderly - to avoid going outdoors unless absolutely necessary and to wear protective masks if they do.Toxic air quality is a recurring problem in Delhi and across parts of northern India during the winter. There isn't a single cause behind the problem, but a mix of factors like low wind speeds, industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, dropping temperatures and the seasonal burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states.The Delhi government enforces a set of special measures known as the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to contain pollution levels.  Stage three of these measures was implemented on Tuesday, which includes a ban on mining activity, stone crushing and prohibiting movement of vehicles carrying dust-generating materials among other things. The worsening air quality led to a people's protest in the capital last weekend, and has also sparked a political row. On Tuesday, Saurabh Bhardwaj, a leader of the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) accused the Delhi government of \"manipulating\" air quality data and failing to protect public health.He said that the city's air quality remains \"alarming\" despite the alleged manipulation of numbers and urged the government to declare a public health emergency.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Delhi government, however, has denied the allegations.\"Our government is working with full seriousness and promptness towards pollution control,\" Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said.Delhi Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told the Hindustan Times that air quality data is publicly available and that water was sprinkled near air quality monitors only to reduce dust, not to manipulate readings.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "44 minutes agoKoh Ewe and Jake Kwon,Seoul correspondentGetty ImagesK-pop record label Ador confirmed that NewJeans members Hyein (left) and Haerin (right) will return to the agency, while Hanni, Danielle and Minji said they would also return to the labelAll five members of NewJeans are due to return to record label Ador, Hanni, Danielle and Minji announced in a statement.Their remarks followed a separate statement in which the label said only Hyein and Haerin would be returning to the agency, a move that led fans to question whether the K-pop group would split up. Ador is yet to confirm if all five members will return to the agency.NewJeans has been locked in a legal battle with Ador, since the five-member group announced last year that they were leaving the agency because of mistreatment and manipulation. Ador has denied these claims.Last month, a South Korean court ruled that NewJeans' contract with Ador - which runs until 2029 - remains valid. NewJeans said it would appeal.The dispute has rocked the K-pop industry, where record labels typically exercise strict control over their artists. Ador is a subsidiary label of Hybe, South Korea's biggest music label behind chart-topping groups such as BTS.In a statement on X, Ador wrote that Hyein and Haerin had decided to \"respect the court's latest ruling\" after \"thoughtful consideration with their respective families and thorough discussions with ADOR\".\"We request the warm support from the fans and respectfully urge you to avoid engaging in unfounded speculation regarding the members,\" the statement said.Later, the other three members - Hanni, Danielle and Minji - announced they had decided to return to Ador \"after careful discussion\". News of their intention to return to the agency \"was relayed late as one member is currently in Antarctica, but as ADOR is not responding at the moment, we are inevitably announcing this through a separate statement\".\"We will continue greeting you with sincere music and performances,\" their statement added. NewJeans' legal representative declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.Formed in July 2022, NewJeans, whose members are aged from 17 to 21, had a dramatic fallout with their agency in 2024.It was sparked by the controversial dismissal of Ador CEO Min Hee-jin, who had also been NewJeans' mentor.NewJeans then accused Ador of \"mistreatment\" and \"deliberate miscommunications and manipulation\", and set out several demands including the reinstatement of Min. When those demands were not met the five members declared they were leaving Ador, which in turn initiated a lawsuit to prevent them from departing.NewJeans's argument was ultimately rejected by the court, in a ruling delivered two weeks ago.After that ruling, NewJeans's lawyer said that the trust between the group and their management had been \"completely ruined\" and that the group would continue its fight.While NewJeans had pledged to appeal the ruling, legal experts generally agreed that they would have very little chance of winning, given how clearly the court had sided with Ador.The deadline for filing the appeal is the end of Wednesday. It is unclear if NewJeans has filed anything yet.ReutersNewJeans enjoyed rapid success since its debut in 2022, but have gone on hiatus amid legal troublesPrior to Hanni, Danielle and Minji announcing their intentions to return to the label, fans had expressed worries that the latest move would spell the end of NewJeans in its current configuration.\"If only two out of five members continue their contracts and the rest end things like this, that's basically a disbandment,\" one person wrote on X.\"It's too hard for an individual to fight a big company,\" wrote another. \"I just like the NewJeans girls ... I'll still support them.\"Since its debut, NewJeans had been poised for a meteoric rise, scoring early chart-toppers.Their first single Attention topped Korean charts while their hit song SuperShy made multiple \"best of the year\" lists at the end of 2023, including those compiled by Rolling Stone, NME and Billboard Magazine.But their drawn-out legal battle has forced them into a hiatus.When NewJeans rebranded themselves NJZ and tried to release a new song, their activities were halted by a court injunction initiated by Ador.Additional reporting by Hosu Lee and Malu Cursino.Watch: 'Trusting time' - NewJeans discusses court ruling in record label dispute",

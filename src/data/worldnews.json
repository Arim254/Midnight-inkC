    "body": "14 hours agoSebastian UsherJerusalemJerusalem: Footage shows scale of ultra-Orthodox protest against conscriptionHundreds of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish Israelis are taking part in a protest in Jerusalem against changes to a legal exemption for religious students from conscription in the military.Almost all sects and factions of the ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, community are taking part in what has been dubbed the \"march of the million\".Since the founding of Israel, students enrolled full-time at a religious school, or yeshiva, have been exempted from conscription, although some other members of the community do serve in the military.Demands for them to play a bigger role have intensified during the war in Gaza.Roads in and around Jerusalem were shut down before the start of one of the biggest anti-conscription protests by ultra-Orthodox Israelis in years.It is bringing together disparate elements of the community, which makes up about 14% of the Israeli population.What is uniting them is their opposition not only to moves to enforce conscription for more of their community, but also anger at hundreds of arrests in recent months of ultra-Orthodox men avoiding the draft.The Haredi believe that their age-old way of life could be under threat.But many in Israel feel they have not shared their fair burden in the war.Bringing them into the military would help with a shortfall in manpower.But there are also concerns in the military about conscripting large numbers of ultra-Orthodox - integration would be a difficult challenge, as well as accommodating the Haredi need to adhere to the strict code of their religious beliefs.",

    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

    "body": "The Sagrada Família has become the tallest church in the world, after workers placed the first part of a cross at the top of its central tower. Now measuring 162.91 metres tall, the Spanish basilica has officially pipped the record from the Ulm Minster in Germany, which has held the crown since 1890.Designed by acclaimed architect Antoni Gaudí, the place of worship has been under construction in the centre of Barcelona for more than a century, with the main building due to be completed next year. The central Tower of Jesus Christ will grow with the addition of the rest of the cross over the next few months, eventually standing at 172 metres tall. The first stone of the Sagrada Família was placed in 1882, with up-and-coming architect Gaudí taking over the project the following year. He transformed the original designs for the basilica into a far more ambitious proposal, which was initially funded by donations from repentant worshippers. At the time of his unexpected death in 1926, just one of the planned 18 towers had been built.In the years following, the construction of the architectural marvel was managed by the Sagrada Família foundation, and funded by contributions from tourists, visitors and private donors.In addition to the death of its primary architect, the basilica has hit a number of roadblocks throughout its almost 150-year construction. During the Spanish Civil War, Catalan anarchists set fire to the crypt, destroying plans and plaster models created by Gaudí that would guide future construction.Most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic saw construction on the building halted, with members of the foundation attributing the pause to a lack of tourism, and the subsequent drop in funding for the project.In September this year, Sagrada Família General Director Xavier Martínez told the Associated Press that the Tower of Jesus Christ would be completed in 2026, to coincide with the centenary of Gaudí's death.The foundation will hold a series of events to commemorate the architect, who is buried in the church's crypt.Work on decorative details, sculptures and a stairway leading to the building's main entrance is expected to continue over the next decade.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDavid GrittenJerusalemIsraeli prime minister's officeIsraeli soldiers salute the coffins, which were handed over by Hamas via the Red Cross in GazaIsrael has confirmed the identities of two deceased hostages that it received from Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza.The bodies were identified as those of Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, the Israeli prime minister's office said on Thursday. Hamas had earlier said it recovered their bodies.\"The Government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Cooper and Sahar families and all the families of the fallen hostages,\" it said in a statement.On Tuesday, the Israeli government accused Hamas of violating the Gaza ceasefire deal after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza.It said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage whose body had been recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023.The Israeli military also released footage filmed by a drone that showed Hamas members removing a body bag containing the remains from a building in Gaza City, reburying it, and then staging the discovery in front of Red Cross staff.The Red Cross said its staff were unaware that the body bag had been moved before their arrival and that the staged recovery was \"unacceptable\".Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".EPAOn Tuesday, Hamas fighters removed a body bag from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Khan YounisHours later, the Israeli government accused Hamas of another ceasefire violation, saying the group's fighters had killed an Israeli soldier in an attack in an area of southern Gaza.Hamas claimed it was not involved in the incident in the Rafah area, but Israel's prime minister ordered a wave of air strikes across Gaza on Tuesday night in response. The Israeli military said it attacked \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\".Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 104 Palestinians were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, making it the deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.US President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire agreement, which his administration brokered along with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, but he added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.Under the deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Eleven of the 13 dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, in which more than 68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterReutersApple boss Tim Cook holds an iPhone 17 pro and an iPhone Air, as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, California, US September 9, 2025.The latest iPhones have seen \"a tremendous response\" across the globe, said Apple boss Tim Cook as the tech giant released its latest financial results.The firm unveiled its thinnest iPhone, the Air, in September, along with upgraded iPhone 17 models, proving a bumper crop for the firm.It said it expects the upcoming Christmas and New Year's period to be a blockbuster, forecasting overall revenue to be up to 12% higher than the same period last year.But Apple narrowly missed estimates for iPhone sales in its fourth quarter that ended in September, which boss Tim Cook blamed on supply constraints for several iPhone models along with a lag in shipments to China.Despite that, during a call with analysts Mr Cook said Apple is heading into the holiday season \"with our most powerful lineup ever\".The iPhone Air helped entice customers and boost sales.If the company meets its sales forecast for the holiday season, it would be Apple's \"best quarter ever\", chief financial officer Kevan Parekh told analysts on Thursday.Apple reported overall fourth quarter revenue of $102.5bn (£77bn), topping analysts' estimates and representing an 8% increase from the previous year. But iPhone revenue, specifically, came in slightly below expectations at $49bn (£37bn).Mr Cook stressed that global demand for iPhone 16 and 17 models has been robust, despite constraints that led to the sales miss in the recent quarter. \"We're not predicting when the supply and demand will balance,\" Mr Cook said. \"We're obviously working very hard to achieve that, because we want to get as many of these products out to customers as possible.\"In the Chinese market, he said he \"couldn't be more pleased with how things are going\", citing strong reception to the new iPhone 17.Data from Counterpoint, a technology market research firm, showed that the first 10 days of iPhone 17 sales in the US and China were up 14% compared with sales of the iPhone 16.The effects of US President Donald Trump's tariffs also remain top of mind for Apple's investors. It manufactures many iPhones in China and its global supply chain leaves it vulnerable to trade wars - though a recent meeting between Trump and President Xi raised hopes for a de-escalation of tensions.Mr Cook on Thursday told analysts that the company took at $1.1bn (£836m) hit from tariffs in the recently ended quarter. He said the hit will likely amount to another $1.4bn in the holiday quarter as Trump imposes taxes on those whom he sees as \"unfavourable\" to the US economy.Amazon, which also reported quarterly results on Thursday, projected sales to land between $206bn (£156bn) and $213bn (£161bn) for the current quarter through December, largely in line with analysts' expectations.\"We're encouraged by the start of the peak season,\" Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, told analysts.Amazon also said that revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business, rose 20% in the third quarter from the previous year - its fastest pace since 2022.For investors, that AI-driven growth could come as a reassurance, as Apple faces fierce competition in the race to dominate the AI boom.Apple's stock has lagged behind that of rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, both of whom on Wednesday reaffirmed their commitment to spending big on the technology. Those firms have reported even faster growth than Amazon in their cloud computing businesses.\"We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity,\" Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, said in a statement.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentThe commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces has warned Russian activity is increasing around the key frontline town of Pokrovsk, saying \"the situation is difficult\".General Oleksandr Syrskyi admitted Russian infantry was massing in the area and said he had visited the frontline himself for talks with key commanders.But he said reports that Ukrainian troops had been \"blockaded\" there by Russian forces was \"untrue\" propaganda.There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town in the Donetsk region in the east of Ukraine. It forms a key transport and supply hub and its capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.In a statement on Telegram, General Syrskyi said: \"In Pokrovsk, enemy infantry, avoiding combat, is amassing in the urban area and changing locations, so the primary objective is to identify and destroy them.\"He added: \"The situation is difficult, but Russian propaganda claims about the alleged 'blockade' of the Ukrainian Defence Forces in Pokrovsk, as well as in Kupiansk, are untrue.\"He said commanders were having to maintain \"a reasonable balance between goals and capabilities.\"\"The main priority is preserving the lives of our soldiers,\" he added.Russian forces have been trying to seize Pokrovsk for more than a year. Taking it would give them a path towards taking the two biggest cities still controlled by Ukraine in the region - Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Russia's chief of general staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, claimed earlier this week Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk had been surrounded.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Pokrovsk was \"the main target\" for Russia whose forces there, he said, outnumbered Ukrainians by eight to one.He told reporters Russia wanted to take the town to convince the United States that Ukraine was on the run.\"They do not have a result they can 'sell' to the Americans. We understand why they need Pokrovsk. They need it only to claim that Ukraine withdraws from the east and gives everything else they want,\" Zelensky said.In its latest assessment, the defence intelligence firm, Sybelline, said the battle for Pokrovsk \"has entered a highly dynamic and intense phase, as the Russian forces intensify their efforts to infiltrate the city and encircle Ukrainian defenders\".Deepstate, a Ukrainian monitoring group, said Russian forces were \"gradually engulfing\" Pokrovsk \"with [their] sheer number of personnel\". It said Russian troops were infiltrating deeper into the town and disrupting Ukrainian supply routes. \"The situation in Pokrovsk is on the brink of crisis and continues to deteriorate, to the point where it may be too late to fix everything,\" the group concluded.",

    "body": "11 hours agoVanessa Buschschlüter and Rute Pina,BBC Brasil, reporting from São PauloBruno ItanDozens of bodies were laid out in a square in Penha, in northern Rio, after the deadliest police raid in the city's historyA photographer who witnessed the aftermath of a massive Brazilian police operation in Rio de Janeiro has told the BBC of how residents came back with mutilated bodies of those who had died.The bodies \"kept coming: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45...\", Bruno Itan told BBC Brasil. They included those of police officers.One of the bodies had been decapitated - others were \"totally disfigured\", he said. Many also had what he says were stab wounds. More than 120 people were killed during Tuesday's raid on a criminal gang - the deadliest such raid in the city.EPA/ShutterstockMore than 100 people were arrested as part of the operationBruno Itan told BBC Brasil that he was first alerted to the raid early on Tuesday by residents of the Alemão neighbourhood, who sent him messages telling him there was a shoot-out. The photographer made his way to the Getúlio Vargas hospital, where the bodies were arriving.Itan says that the police stopped members of the press from entering the Penha neighbourhood, where the operation was under way. \"Police officers formed a line and said: 'The press doesn't get past here.'\"But Itan, who grew up in the area, says he was able to make his way into the cordoned-off area, where he remained until the next morning. He says that Tuesday night, local residents began to search the hillside which divides Penha from the nearby Alemão neighbourhood for relatives who had been missing since the police raid.Bruno ItanResidents of the Penha neighbourhood proceeded to place the recovered bodies in a  square - and Itan's photos show the reaction of the people there. \"The brutality of it all impacted me a lot: the sorrow of the families, mothers fainting, pregnant wives, crying, outraged parents,\" the photographer recalled.Bruno ItanThere was shock in Penha as locals retrieved more and more bodies from the nearby  hillsideThe governor of Rio state said that the massive police operation involving around 2,500 security personnel was aimed at stopping a criminal group known as Comando Vermelho (Red Command) from expanding its territory.Initially, the Rio state government maintained that \"60 suspects and four police officers\" had been killed in the operation.They have since said that their \"preliminary\" count shows that 117 \"suspects\" have been killed.Rio's public defender's office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, has put the total number of people killed at 132.According to researchers, Red Command is the only criminal group which in recent years has managed to make territorial gains in the state of Rio de Janeiro.It is widely considered one of the two largest gangs in the country, alongside First Capital Command (PCC), and has a history dating back more than 50 years. According to Brazilian journalist Rafael Soares, who has been covering crime in Rio for years, Red Command \"operates like a franchise\" with local criminal leaders forming part of the gang and becoming \"business partners\".The gang engages primarily in drug trafficking, but also smuggles guns, gold, fuel, alcohol and tobacco.According to the authorities, gang members are well armed and police said that during the raid, they came under attack from explosive-laden drones. The governor of Rio state, Cláudio Castro, described Red Command members as \"narcoterrorists\" and called the four police officers killed in the raid \"heroes\".But the number of people killed in the operation has come in for criticism with the  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights saying it was \"horrified\".At a news conference on Wednesday, Governor Castro defended the police force.\"It wasn't our intention to kill anyone. We wanted to arrest them all alive,\" he said.He added that the situation had escalated because the suspects had retaliated: \"It was a consequence of the retaliation they carried out and the disproportionate use of force by those criminals.\"The governor also said that the bodies displayed by locals in Penha had been \"manipulated\". In a post on X, he said that some of them had been stripped of the camouflage clothing he said they had been wearing \"in order to shift blame onto the police\".Felipe Curi of Rio's civil police force also said that \"camouflage clothing, vests, and weapons\" had been removed from the bodies and showed footage appearing to show a man cutting camouflage clothing off a corpse. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has summoned Governor Castro to a hearing on Monday to explain the police actions \"in detail\".With additional reporting by BBC Brasil's Carol Castro in Rio de Janeiro.",

    "body": "Trump caps refugee admissions at record low - with most to be white South Africans2 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseThe Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.The move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.No reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was \"justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest\".In January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety. The previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.The notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years. The tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.The South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.Watch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turnOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".The US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups. Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in USIs there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Some have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East. \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\" \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added. Refugees International also slammed the move, saying it \"makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values\".\"Let us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status – they are not fleeing systematic persecution,\" Refugees International said in its statement.The South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement. During the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".Earlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. While the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. ",

    "body": "'Can't go back' - families in violence-hit Indian state fear resettlement deadline4 hours agoJugal PurohitBBC HindiMidhat Ullah HasaniChingakham Radha has moved to a temporary shelter but longs to return home Thousands of people displaced by ethnic clashes in India's north-eastern state of Manipur two years ago now face an uncertain future, as the government plans to shut down all temporary relief camps by December.The violence, which erupted in May 2023 between the majority Meitei and the indigenous Kuki communities, was the worst the region had witnessed in decades.It started after protests by the largely Christian Kuki community against the Meiteis, mostly Hindus, who were demanding official tribal status that would grant them access to the same government benefits and job quotas as other tribes, including Kukis.At least 260 people were killed in the clashes and around 60,000 displaced people have since been living in temporary shelters.Over the past two years, the government has made repeated promises to rehabilitate the displaced, but little has changed on the ground. Many say their lives remain in a limbo - effectively homeless and without a steady source of income.Anxieties grew further in July when the state's then Chief Secretary Prashant Singh announced that all relief camps would be shut down by December and its residents would be resettled.He added that those unable to return to their homes would be relocated to pre-fabricated housing units. The government, however, did not clarify where these units would be - whether near the relief camps or near displaced people's original homes  - worsening their concerns about future. Uncertainty grew in September when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his first visit to Manipur since the violence began, announced that 7,000 new homes would be built to resettle the displaced in \"appropriate locations\" without giving any other details. Midhat Ullah HasaniThousands are still living in relief camps in the hilly Churachandpur regionOn the ground, Manipur remains sharply divided: the Meiteis inhabit the Imphal Valley, while the Kukis live in the surrounding hill districts; and security forces continue to patrol the buffer zones that separate the two communities.A security official deployed in the area told BBC Hindi that his mandate was to \"ensure that Meiteis and Kukis remain in their respective areas and do not mix\".Experts say resettling people in their original neighbourhoods is crucial to prevent the violence from redrawing Manipur's social map.\"This is not good for a secular, democratic India. Resettling them in their original homes is most critical,\" said RK Nimai Singh, former secretary to the Manipur governor.He added that many displaced people feared that if they left the relief camps and moved into temporary housing, they might never be able to return to their homes. It's a thought that haunts Hatnu Haokip. For her, home means only one place - Imphal valley - and she yearns to go back. \"But that can't happen because our village is now surrounded by Meitei people,\" said the 22-year-old who is now living in a relief camp in the hilly Churachandpur regionMs Haokip added that she would feel safer if Kuki leaders were given autonomy to set up a separate federally-administered territory for the community. This sentiment was echoed by several other Kukis, who also feel apprehensive of returning to their homes. On the other hand, most Meiteis BBC Hindi spoke to said they wanted to go back home. Irom Abung, who once ran a water supply business in Churachandpur, now lives in a relief camp near a buffer zone.His house was damaged during the violence, but Mr Abung says he will never give up on the place he once called home.\"My land remains. I will never sell it because I know I will return one day,\" he said. \"Efforts must be made to bridge the gap between our two communities so people can go back to their lives.\"The unease, coupled with uncertainty over where the new homes will be built, has raised doubts over whether the government would be able to close all relief camps by December.Government officials, however, insist that the resettlement plan is on track.\"From about 290 camps initially, we've brought the number down to around 260,\" a senior Manipur government official said.\"Eventually, we want to resettle people in the areas from where they fled, once they feel safe to return.\"The official added that while they understood people's concerns, it was also in the state's interest for them to return home - otherwise, the divisions would only grow deeper.Midhat Ullah HasaniMany women in the relief camps are crocheting and selling dolls to earn a little extra income to support their familiesAs tens of thousands of people continue to live in relief camps, many complain about not getting the facilities the government promised them.Nemhoichong Lhungdim, a single mother, said her 11-year-old son had suffered a debilitating eye injury a few months back and has lost sight in one eye.After government doctors failed to help, she borrowed money to take him to a private hospital, but was unable to afford the treatment.\"I was told it would cost about 300,000 rupees ($3,400; £2,600). I don't have that kind of money,\" she said.Ms Lhungdim says the government sometimes organises health camps, but they have never treated her son. BBC Hindi has reached out to officials for a response.Inside the camps, residents say prolonged displacement and uncertainty are also taking a toll on people's mental health.Salam Monika, 25, says her uncle took his own life last year after being driven to despair by a lack of livelihood opportunities. She says the family could not access medical help.\"Some mental health workers visited our camp a few times since 2023, but this year, they haven't come at all,\" she said.BBC Hindi has reached out to the government for comment.Meanwhile, those moved from camps into temporary housing say that while they now have a roof over their heads, they still struggle to make ends meet as livelihood remains a concern.Chingakham Radha, one of the newly resettled residents, said she learned to make crochet dolls while living in the camp and now earns a small income from selling them. \"The money is very little, just enough to get by,\" she said.Before the conflict, Ms Radha was a homemaker and her husband worked as a labourer. They were not wealthy, but had a happy life.Thinking about those days, Ms Radha says life has become uncertain now. \"Some days my husband finds work, but other times weeks go by without any work,\" she said. \"I want to return home to Churachandpur, but those hopes are fading with time.\"Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "17 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersPrecious crown jewels were taken during the theft earlier this monthFive more suspects have been arrested over their involvement in the Louvre heist, Paris' public prosecutor has said.They were detained on Wednesday night in the Paris region during coordinated raids, according to Laure Beccuau. One of the suspects is thought to be part of the four-man team that carried out the heist, who were seen on CCTV. Two of the other alleged thieves have already been arrested and have \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the brazen theft, while the fourth person has not yet been caught. It is not clear what role the other newly arrested people allegedly played in the theft, but Beccuau told French radio station RTL on Thursday that they \"may eventually inform us about how the incident took place\".Beccuau said the arrests had been made in areas in and around Paris, including the  suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis.Phones and other objects found on the suspects during the raid were allowing investigators to study encrypted messages, she added.Those arrested can be detained for up to four days before being charged or released.How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftFrench investigators are not giving many more details away at this stage but Beccuau said that DNA from one of those arrested on Wednesday night could be linked to the crime scene. \"We had him in our sights,\" she said of the main suspect. She specified that the latest arrests were not related to statements made by the previously detained suspects but to \"other elements of the case\".The authorities have previously said that the gang involved in the heist could be bigger than those who physically stole the jewels.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the Louvre - the world's most-visited museum - on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight. The precious jewels have not been recovered yet.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe first two people who were arrested over the heist - both men in their thirties with criminal records - are thought to be the pair who used power tools to enter the museum's  Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) and steal some of the French crown jewels.They were taken into custody late last week. Beccuau told a press conference on Wednesday that one of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but that the other man had not been planning to leave France, contrary to earlier media reports.There was no evidence at this stage to suggest the theft was an inside job, she added, confirming no accomplices worked at the museum. On the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30, just after the museum opened to visitors, Beccuau said at a press conference on Wednesday.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Gallery of Apollo via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Beccuau said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars and heading east. Nobody had been threatened during the raid. France's justice minister said security protocols in the Louvre - one of the world's most famous museums - \"failed\" in preventing the theft. It was later revealed by the Louvre's director that the only camera monitoring the Gallery of Apollo was pointing away from a balcony the thieves climbed over to break in. Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicle",

    "body": "16 hours agoLaura BickerChina correspondent Watch: US and China's different reports of their trade meetingUS President Donald Trump came away from his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping full of bombastic optimism. He called it a \"great success\" and rated it 12, on a scale of 1 to 10. China was less enthusiastic. Beijing's initial statement sounds like an instruction manual, with Xi urging teams on both sides to \"follow up as soon as possible\".Trump is after a deal that could happen \"pretty soon\", while Beijing, it appears, wants to keep talking because it's playing the long game.  There was a more detailed second Chinese statement that echoed what Trump had said on board Air Force One.Among other things, the US would lower tariffs on Chinese imports, and China would suspend controls on the export of rare earths - critical minerals without which you cannot make smartphones, electric cars and, perhaps more crucially, military equipment.There is no deal yet, and negotiators on both sides have already been talking for months to iron out the details. But Thursday's agreement is still a breakthrough. It steadies what has become a rocky relationship between the world's two biggest economies and it assures global markets. But it is only a temporary truce. It doesn't solve the differences at the heart of such a competitive relationship. \"The US and China are going in different directions,\" says Kelly Ann Shaw, who was an economic adviser to Trump in his first term.\"It's really about managing the breakup in a way that does a limited amount of damage, that preserves US interests, and I think from China's perspective, preserves their own interests. But this is not a relationship that is necessarily going to improve dramatically anytime soon.\"'Struggle, but don't break'There is an art to doing a deal with Trump.It involves flattery - and most countries have tried it, including on his trip to Asia so far. South Korea gave him an enormous golden crown, while Japan's prime minister  nominated him for a Nobel Peace prize.But the Chinese leader offered only a meeting at a South Korean air base, where he and Trump would cross paths - as one flew in to the country, and the other departed.  It didn't feel out of step with China's guarded but defiant response from the start of Trump's trade war. Just days after the American president increased tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing retaliated with its own levies.Chinese officials told the world that there would be no winners in a trade war. Like Trump, Xi too believed he had the upper hand - and he seemed to have a plan. He decided to use the country's economic weight - as the world's factory, as a massive market for its goods - to push back. Unlike Trump, he does not need to worry about elections or a worried vote base. That doesn't mean that Xi faces no pressures - he certainly does. He needs China's economy to grow, and create jobs and wealth so the Chinese Communist Party's power is not challenged by instability or discontent. Getty ImagesAnd yet, despite the country's current challenges - a real estate crisis, high youth unemployment and weak consumer spending - China has shown it is willing to absorb the pain of Trump's tariffs. Beijing would \"fight until the bitter end\" was the message from various ministries.  \"China's main principle is struggle, but don't break,\" says Keyu Jin, author of The New China Playbook.\"And it has escalated to de-escalate, which is a very new tactic.\"Xi had a planThat is, China hit Trump where it hurt. For the first time, it limited exports of rare earths to the US - and China processes around 90% of the world's rare earth metals.\"The nuance often missed in the rare earths debate is that China has an overwhelming position over the most strategic bit of the rare earth supply chain -  the heavy rare earths used in advanced defence systems,\" says Jason Bedford, macroeconomics expert and investment analyst. \"That advantage is far harder to dislodge than other parts of the rare earths industry.\" So getting China to relax those export controls became a priority for Washington - and that was a key bit of leverage for Xi when he sat down with Trump.China had also stopped buying US soybeans, which was aimed at farmers in Republican states - Trump's base. Reports this week say Beijing has already started buying soybeans from the US again. \"If the US thinks that it can dominate China, it can suppress China, I think has proven to be wrong,\" Ms Jin says. \"This is really signalling to the world, especially the United States, that China needs to be respected, that it will not kowtow or give too many political or economic concessions.\"Getty ImagesUS soybean farmers have been impacted by China's decision to stop buying the productTrump's team has found itself dealing with a stronger China compared to his first term. Beijing has learnt lessons, too. It spent the last four years finding new trade partners and relying less on US exports - nearly a fifth of Chinese exports once went to the US but in the first half of this year that figure dropped to 11%.Xi showed up in South Korea - after officially confirming the meeting with Trump just the day before - to take part in political theatre that seemed to underline a position of strength. As usual, he was in front of Trump for the handshake. He stood unblinking as Trump leaned forward to whisper in his ear - the kind of ad lib moment China abhors.At the end of the meeting, Trump ushered Xi to his waiting car where the Chinese leader was immediately surrounded by his security team. The US president was then forced to wander off camera to find his vehicle alone.And yet, there are many positives to take away from this superpower summit - the first of  Trump's second term in office.\"China wants to be in a position of strength when it comes to negotiations, but it won't break the relationship, because that is in nobody's interest, including China's,\" Ms Jin says. For starters, businesses, the markets and other countries caught in between the rivals will welcome the calm. But observers are not sure it will last. \"I think over the medium to long-term, the US and China have very serious differences, and I would not be surprised to see some more destabilisation in the next three to six months,\" says Ms Shaw.Has Trump got the bigger, better deal with China he always wanted? Not yet.Even if he does get a deal, and the two sides put ink on paper, Beijing has now shown that it is not willing to bend to Washington - and that it is more resilient.The rivalry between the two sides is likely to continue, if or even when there is ever a done deal.",

    "body": "'We saw people murdered in front of us' - Sudan siege survivors speak to the BBC6 hours agoBarbara Plett UsherAfrica correspondentBBCEzzeldin Hassan Musa was beaten with sticks before he managed to fleeShaken, scratched and left with just the clothes he is wearing, Ezzeldin Hassan Musa describes the brutality of Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the wake of the paramilitary group taking control of el-Fasher city in the Darfur region.He says its fighters tortured and murdered men trying to flee.Now in the town of Tawila, lying exhausted on a mat under a gazebo, Ezzeldin is one of several thousand people who have made it to relative safety after escaping what the UN has described as \"horrific\" violence.On Wednesday, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\" in el-Fasher and said they would be investigated. A day later a senior UN official said the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects.About an 80km (50-mile) journey from el-Fasher, Tawila is one of several places where those lucky enough to escape the RSF fighters are fleeing to.\"We left el-Fasher four days ago. The suffering we encountered on the way was unimaginable,\" Ezzeldin says.\"We were divided into groups and beaten. The scenes were extremely brutal. We saw people murdered in front of us. We saw people being beaten. It was really terrible.\"I myself was hit on the head, back, and legs. They beat me with sticks. They wanted to execute us completely. But when the opportunity arose, we ran, while others in front were detained.\"Most of those who have reached Tawila are women and childrenEzzeldin says he joined a group of escapees who took shelter in a building, moving by night and sometimes literally crawling along the ground in an effort to remain hidden.\"Our belongings were stolen,\" he says. \"Phones, clothes - everything. Literally, even my shoes were stolen. Nothing was left.\"We went without food for three days while walking in the streets. By God's mercy, we made it through.\"Those in Tawila told the BBC that men making the journey were particularly likely to be subjected to scrutiny by the RSF, with fighters targeting anyone suspected of being a soldier.Reports of mass killings in Sudan have echoes of its dark pastNew videos show executions after RSF militia takes key Sudan cityA simple guide to what is happening in SudanEzzeldin is one of around 5,000 people thought to have arrived in Tawila since the fall of el-Fasher on Sunday.Many have made the entire journey on foot, travelling for three or four days to flee the violence.A freelance journalist based in Tawila, working for the BBC, has conducted among the first interviews with some of those who made the journey.Ahmed Ismail Ibrahim says four of the six people he fled with were shot deadNear to Ezzeldin sits Ahmed Ismail Ibrahim, his body bandaged in several places.He says his eye was injured in an artillery strike, and he left the city on Sunday after receiving treatment in hospital.He and six other men were stopped by RSF fighters.\"Four of them - they killed them in front of us. Beat them and killed them,\" he says, adding that he was shot three times.Ahmed describes how the fighters demanded to see the phones of the three who were left alive and went through them, searching their messages.One fighter, he says, finally told them: \"OK, get up and go.\" They fled into the scrub.\"My brothers,\" he adds, \"they didn't leave me behind.\"We walked for about 10 minutes, then rested for 10 minutes, and we continued until we found peace now.\"Yusra Ibrahim Mohamed fled after her husband, who was a soldier, was killedIn the next tent in the clinic run by medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Yusra Ibrahim Mohamed describes making the decision to flee the city after her husband, a soldier with the Sudanese army, was killed.\"My husband was in the artillery,\" she says. \"He was returning home and was killed during the attacks.\"We stayed patient. Then the clashes and attacks continued. We managed to escape.\"We left three days ago,\" she says, \"moving in different directions from the artillery areas. The people guiding us didn't know what was happening.\"If someone resisted, they were beaten or robbed. They would take everything you had. People could even be executed. I saw dead bodies in the streets.\"Alfadil Dukhan works in the MSF clinic.He and his colleagues have been providing emergency care to those who arrive - among them, he says, are 500 in need of urgent medical treatment.\"Most of the new arrivals are elders and women or children,\" the medic says.\"The wounded are suffering, and some of them they already have amputations.\"So they are really suffering a lot. And we are trying to just give them some support and some medical care.\"Those arriving this week in Tawila join hundreds of thousands there who fled previous rounds of violence in el-Fasher.Before its seizure by the RSF on Sunday, the city had been besieged for 18 months. Those trapped inside were bombarded by a barrage of deadly artillery and air strikes as the army and the paramilitaries battled for el-Fasher. And they were plunged into a severe hunger crisis by an RSF blockade of supplies and aid.Hundreds of thousands were displaced in April when the RSF seized control of the Zamzam camp close to the city, at the time one of the main sites housing people forced to flee fighting elsewhere.It is thought that around 5,000 have reached Tawila in the last few days - it is not clear how many remain behindSome experts have expressed concern at the relatively low numbers arriving at places like Tawila now.\"This is actually a point of worry for us,\" says Caroline Bouvoir, who works with refugees in neighbouring Chad for the aid agency Solidarités International\"In the past few days we have about 5,000 people who have arrived, which considering we believe there were about a quarter of a million people still in the city, that is obviously not that many,\" she says.\"We see the conditions that those who have arrived are in. They are highly malnourished, highly dehydrated, or sick or injured, and they are clearly traumatised with what they have seen either in the city or on the road.\"We believe that many people are stuck currently in different locations between Tawila and el-Fasher, and unable to move forward - either because of their physical condition or because of the insecurity on the road, where militias are unfortunately attacking people who are trying to find safe haven.\"For Ezzeldin the relief of having reached safety is tempered by the fears for those still behind him on the journey.\"My message is that public roads should be secured for citizens,\" he pleads, \"or humanitarian aid sent to the streets.\"People are in a critical state - they can't move, speak, or seek help.\"Aid should reach them, because many are missing and suffering.\"More BBC stories on the conflict:Sudan's years of war - BBC smuggles in phones to reveal hunger and fearA pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zoneEl-Fasher siege: My son's whole body is full of shrapnelSudan's fertile region where food is rotting amid famine and warGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

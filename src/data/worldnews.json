    "body": "'Superhuman' teen swims hours to save family stranded off Australian coast3 hours agoKerena CobbinaGetty ImagesThe family were stranded 4km off the coast in Geographe BayA 13-year-old boy has been praised for his determination after he swam through rough waters in fading light to save his mother and two siblings who had been swept out to sea off Australia's coast.The family had been paddleboarding and kayaking at Geographe Bay in the south of Western Australia, on Friday when strong winds pushed their inflatables off course, police said.The teenager began to paddle back to shore to raise the alarm but his kayak took on water - so he swam the remaining 4km (2 nautical miles).\"The bravery, strength and courage shown by this family were extraordinary, especially the young fella who swam 4km to raise the alarm,\" Naturaliste Volunteer Marine Rescue Group said.The organisation's commander Paul Bresland described the efforts of the teenager as \"superhuman\".\"He swam in, he reckons, the first two hours with a life jacket on,\" he told ABC News. \"The brave fella thought he's not going to make it with a life jacket on, so he ditched it, and he swam the next two hours without a life jacket.\"The boy was able to raise the alarm by 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Friday evening, sparking a huge search for the missing relatives from Quindalup beach, near Busselton, WA Police said in a statement on Monday.The boy's 47-year-old mother, her other son, 12, and daughter, eight, were located at around 20:30 by a rescue helicopter clinging to a paddleboard about 14km offshore. \"A volunteer marine rescue vessel was directed to their location and all three were successfully rescued and returned to shore,\" the force said.Insp James Bradley said the incident was an important reminder of how rapidly ocean conditions can change. \"Thankfully, all three people were wearing life jackets, which contributed to their survival,\" he told local media.\"The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough - his determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.\"The family were assessed by paramedics before being taken to a nearby hospital, police said.The family were later discharged and visited the marine rescue crew to say thank you, the ABC reported.",

    "body": "7 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America online editorReutersLaura Fernández sailed to victory in the first round with no need for a run-offThe candidate for the governing conservative Sovereign People's Party, Laura Fernández, has won the presidential election in Costa Rica. With more than 88% of the votes counted, Fernández had over 48% of the votes, far ahead of the second-placed centrist candidate, Álvaro Ramos, who conceded defeat.Fernández ran on a promise to deepen the tough-on-crime approach of the outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves, who had handpicked her as his successor. Voters had said they were concerned about a surge in drug-related violence in the Central American country. The size of her vote share - which exceeded the 40% needed to win outright in the first round - means that there is no need for a run-off.Fernández will be sworn in on 8 May.In her victory speech, the 39-year-old said she would plough ahead with the policies introduced by Chaves, whose chief of staff she was.Under Costa Rica's constitution, presidents are not allowed to serve two consecutive terms and Chaves was therefore barred from standing for re-election. Fernández has hinted she may appoint him to a post in her cabinet. Costa Rica, one of Central America's safest countries and a stable democracy, has seen a rise in crime over the past years as transnational criminal gangs have expanded in the region.On the campaign trail, Fernández said she would emulate some of the policies of the El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele.Bukele has sky-high approval ratings with Salvadoreans saying they are grateful for his iron-fist approach to crime, which has seen the murder rate plummet.Fernández has said she will declare a state of emergency in areas where gangs hold sway and finish the construction of a high-security jail similar to the Cecot prison in El Salvador.Addressing concerns by her critics that her policies could erode the rights of citizens, Fernández declared in her victory speech that her government would be one of \"dialogue and national harmony, respectful and firmly based in the rule of law\".She did however strike a combative note too, criticising the opposition for its \"obstruction and sabotage\" in a reference to the challenges Chaves faced getting some of his policies approved in parliament, which was dominated by opposition lawmakers.With her party winning 30 out of the 57 seats in parliament, Fernández is expected to have more backing in the legislature than her predecessor in office.ReutersBefore running for the presidency, the 39-year-old served as planning minister as well as in other posts.But above all, she is seen as the heir to Chaves, whose direct and sometimes confrontational style she shares.She is also expected to maintain the close ties her predecessor built with the US.Chaves signed a \"safe third-country migrant agreement\" with the US, which means the Trump administration can deport migrants from countries other than Costa Rica to the Central American nation.The agreement allows the US to remove migrants from countries deemed unsafe to a third country considered safe. The Trump administration has described Costa Rica as a \"key global cocaine transshipment point\", adding that is had \"become an increasingly significant waypoint for criminal organisations trafficking cocaine\" to the US.Fernández has said she would be would be willing to declare a state of emergency - and lift some of citizens' rights - if organised crime where to further take hold in certain areas. She will become the second woman to govern the Central American nation after Laura Chinchilla, who was elected president in 2010.",

The resort's chief executive Tsuneo Kubo expressed his \"deepest condolences to the bereaved family\" and said safety measures would be strengthened.He said in a statement that an unfastened buckle on the woman's backpack had become hooked to the chair while the bag's chest strap was still fastened, causing her to be dragged along with it after trying to disembark.The lift was stopped by an attendant who pressed the emergency button, after which first aid was administered and the woman was transported to hospital by ambulance, Kubo added.The accident took place at the top of the two-person Tsuga No.2 Pair Lift. The woman had been riding the lift with another person, police told local media.The lift operator said it was co-operating with police and other authorities as the cause of the accident was investigated and safety procedures reviewed.\"We will take concrete measures to prevent recurrence,\" Kubo said. \"We take this situation very seriously and will strive to operate the ski resort in a safe manner so that our customers can use it with peace of mind.\"Police are questioning resort staff and inspecting the lift equipment as part of their inquiry, according to local media.Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that one of its citizens had died in Japan and said it was providing consular assistance to the family.\"We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time. Owing to our privacy obligations we are unable to provide further comment,\" a spokesperson said.Tsugaike Mountain Resort in Hakuba Valley is one of Nagano's largest ski areas, popular with both domestic and international visitors.",

He has campaigned for more autonomy for Tibet, but Beijing considers it an integral part of China.In a message on social media the Dalai Lama, who is also a Nobel peace laureate, said: \"I receive this recognition with gratitude and humility.\"I don't see it as something personal, but as a recognition of our shared universal responsibility.\"The award was collected on his behalf by musician Rufus Wainwright, who was among the artists to feature on the audiobook.Getty ImagesRufus Wainwright collected the award on behalf of the Tibetan spiritual leaderLast year the Dalai Lama confirmed plans to name a successor, which has caused further friction with China. According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after death - a process deeply rooted in spiritual customs, not political authority.He has previously said his reincarnation will take place in the \"free world\", meaning outside of atheist and communist China but Beijing swiftly rejected his authority to determine a successor.Chinese officials insist that any succession must follow Chinese laws, religious rituals and historical conventions - and ultimately be approved by the government in Beijing.The announcement has reignited fears among Tibetans in exile that China will attempt to name a successor to tighten control over Tibet, the region it occupied in 1950 and has ruled ever since.",

    "body": "7 hours agoMadeline HalpertNew YorkAFP via Getty ImagesThe partial US government shutdown entered its third day on Monday without resolution as Democrats continued to demand immigration reforms as part of any funding deal to reopen the government.Senate Democrats and Republicans agreed to a package of five spending bills on Thursday, but stripped out a sixth bill on full fiscal year funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The Senate instead approved a two-week funding for the DHS that gives lawmakers more time to work out disputes over its long-term budget.Democrats want changes to the immigration enforcement operation, including requiring agents to wear body cameras that are turned on and to not wear masks.The package approved by the Senate must now be cleared by the House of Representatives before it is sent to President Donald Trump's desk for signature.The Senate package includes funding for the defence department, the health department, the Treasury, the federal court system and other agencies until the end of the 2026 fiscal year on 30 September.But funding for these federal agencies ended at midnight on Saturday, resulting in a partial shutdown, as the House has yet to approve it. The effects will be minimal though, as many government services do not operate over the weekend.The House Rules Committee is expected to meet on Monday afternoon to consider the funding package.The Senate-approved package must first clear a procedural hurdle known as the rule vote, which Democrats are expected to vote against.California Democratic Representative Ro Khanna told NBC News on Sunday that he was advocating for his colleagues to vote against the DHS stopgap funding. \"I just don't see how in good conscience Democrats can vote for continuing ICE funding when they're killing American citizens,\" he said. Yet Republican leaders said they were confident they could pass all the bills soon. \"We'll get this done by Tuesday, I'm convinced,\" said Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Fox News on Sunday. The Republican leader told NBC that a winter storm could make it difficult to get lawmakers back in town to vote. Republicans only have a one-vote majority in the House.The impasse comes as thousands of people have taken to the streets in Minneapolis, to protest against Operation Metro Surge - a Trump administration immigration enforcement effort that has drawn widespread outrage after federal agents fatally shot two US citizens.Democrats have demanded changes in funding to DHS in light of the fatal shootings, and have advocated for changes to ICE protocol such as banning agents' use of masks and having stricter warrant requirements. The DHS is a sprawling department encompassing multiple agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Coast Guard and Secret Service.Thousands of federal agents from ICE and CBP have been deployed to Minnesota as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.",

    "body": "4 hours agoTom BennettGetty ImagesThe South African comedian was hosting the music awardsUS President Donald Trump has threatened to sue comedian Trevor Noah after he joked about Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at the Grammy Awards.Hosting the event, Noah said: \"Song of the Year - that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein's island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton.\"Trump is known to have been an associate of Epstein for years, but says he had no knowledge of his crimes and that they fell out in about 2004. There are no suggestions he ever visited Epstein's private island and he has not been accused of any crime by Epstein's victims.  The US justice department has said allegations about him are unfounded and false.Trump responded to Noah's joke by saying he would be \"sending my lawyers to sue\". Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!!\"I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.\"Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.\"He added: \"Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!\"Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor.He had purchased his private island in 1998. Multiple survivors have alleged that they were trafficked there and abused. Trump has engaged in legal action with multiple media organisations in recent years, including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.In December, he filed a multi-billion dollar lawsuit in a Florida court accusing the BBC of defamation and of violating a trade practices law over the editing of a Panorama programme.Noah is a South African-born comedian who hosted The Daily Show on Comedy Central in the US for seven years.

    "body": "12 hours agoKoh EweCCTVA Guangdong court convicted more than 20 of the Bai family's members and associates of fraud, homicide and injuryChina has executed four members of the Bai family mafia, one of the notorious dynasties that ran scam centres in Myanmar, state media report.They were among 21 of the family's members and associates who were convicted of fraud, homicide, injury and other crimes by a court in Guangdong province.Last November the court sentenced five of them to death including the clan's patriarch Bai Suocheng, who died of illness after his conviction, state media reported.For years, the Bais, Mings and several other families dominated Myanmar's border town of Laukkaing, where they ran casinos, red-light districts and cyberscam operations.Among the clans, the Bais were \"number one\", Bai Suocheng's son previously told state media after he was detained.The Bais, who controlled their own militia, established 41 compounds to house cyberscam activities and casinos, authorities said. Within the walls of those compounds was a culture of violence, where beatings and torture were routine. The Bai family's criminal activities led to the deaths of six Chinese citizens, the suicide of one person and multiple injuries, the court said.The Bais rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing - who now leads Myanmar's military government.The military leader had been looking for co-operative allies, and Bai Suocheng - then a deputy of the warlord - fitted the bill.But the families' empires crashed in 2023, when Beijing became frustrated by the Myanmar military's inaction on the scam operations and tacitly backed an offensive by ethnic insurgents in the area, which marked a turning point in Myanmar's civil war.That led to the capture of the scam mafias and their members were handed to Beijing. In China, they became subjects of state documentaries which emphasised Chinese authorities' resolve to eradicate the scam networks. With these recent executions Beijing appears to be sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers. Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the United Nations.Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese as well.",

    "body": "15 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterThe Kennedy Center in Washington DC will be closed for a two-year renovation beginning in July, US President Donald Trump has announced.Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday that the centre would close on 4 July this year \"in honour of the 250th Anniversary of our Country\". The move follows several artists cancelling performances at the storied institution after it was recently renamed as the Trump Kennedy Center.Shortly after taking office, the president fired several of the board members at the centre and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board.The new board renamed the institution the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in December. New signage appeared on the building's exterior the following day.Several musical acts, including Wicked composer Steven Schwartz and a group called Doug Varone and the Dancers, cancelled performances at the centre in the following weeks because of the name change. On Thursday, the venue hosted a premiere screening of a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump.The US president said there would be a \"scheduled grand reopening\" of the facility and that the renovations had already been financed. \"I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for construction, revitalisation, and complete rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest performing arts facility of its kind, anywhere in the world,\" he wrote.\"In other words, if we don't close, the quality of construction will not be nearly as good, and the time to completion, because of interruptions with Audiences from the many events using the facility, will be much longer.\"Trump had lambasted the physical state of the centre and had worked with the US Congress to allocate more than $250m (£182m) to rebuild it, one of many renovation projects he has taken on in his second term. Some US lawmakers and legal scholars have argued that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, Congress must have a say on any name change.Last December, Democratic US Representative Joyce Beatty filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name for that reason. Some members of President John F Kennedy's family have also denounced the move. The centre was named in Kennedy's memory shortly after his assassination.Joe Kennedy III, a former US House of Representatives member and grandnephew of the late president, said the venue was \"a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".",

    "body": "1 day agoJaroslav LukivEPAAttackers struck cities across Balochistan including the provincial capital QuettaA series of gun and bomb attacks across Pakistan's south-western Balochistan province have killed 31 civilians and 17 security service personnel, the region's Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti says.Security forces responding to the violence killed at least 145 attackers during a 40-hour gun battle, he said. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group had earlier said it was behind the attacks, claiming dozens of soldiers were killed.It marks an escalation of violence in the impoverished but resource-rich province, where Pakistan's government has been battling an ethnic insurgency for decades.Pakistan accused India of supporting the BLA. Delhi has repeatedly denied such accusations.Grenade and gun attacks in the provincial capital Quetta and cities and towns across the province targeted hospitals, schools, banks and markets, Pakistan's junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry said.\"In each case, the attackers came in dressed as civilians and indiscriminately targeted ordinary people working in shops,\" he said, adding that the attackers had used civilians as human shields.Armed attackers also opened fire at security installations, attempted to carry out suicide bombings and briefly blocked roads in urban areas.Some key administrative buildings in Quetta and nearby roads were reported to have been sealed off during the day. Mobile phone services were jammed, and regional train services were suspended.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later praised the military, pledging to \"continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication\".The BLA said it had launched a coordinated operation dubbed Herof, or \"black storm\" against security forces, and claimed to have killed 84 members of the security forces and kidnapped a further 18. The claim has not been independently verified and the Pakistani military has not commented.The BLA accuses Pakistan's federal government of exploiting the rich mineral resources of its largest province without the local population benefiting. Local activists also blame Pakistani security forces for enforced disappearances, which Islamabad denies.Balochistan covers nearly 44% of the country's total land, sharing a volatile border with Iran and Afghanistan and covering part of the Arabian Sea coastline. It is home to about 5% of the country's more than 240 million people. The province is also the richest in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals. The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which is the largest ethnic group there. Resistance against the Pakistani government and an insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan gained independence from the British Empire.",

    "body": "23 hours agoHenri AstierWikipedia CommonsJavier Tarazona was arrested in July 2021 - photo Juanjoseco123, Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 4.0Prominent Venezuelan rights activist Javier Tarazona has been freed, in the latest prisoner release announced by the government amid US pressure for reforms.Tarazona, the head of human rights NGO Fundaredes, was arrested in 2021 and detained in the notorious El Helicoide prison in the capital Caracas. His release was announced on Sunday by Fundaredes.Foro Penal, another Venezuelan rights group, said it had verified the liberation of more than 300 political prisoners since 8 January.On Friday acting President, Delcy Rodríguez said the government would introduce an amnesty law that is expected to benefit hundreds of political prisoners. Under the bill, El Helicoide is also due to be closed.In its statement on Sunday, Fundaredes said Tarazona had been jailed \"for defending human rights, denouncing abuses, and speaking out\".It added that his release did not \"erase the injustice he suffered\", but represented \"a necessary step in a process marked by criminalisation, persecution, and a lack of due process\".Tarazona had alleged that government officials had links with guerrillas in Colombia, with which Venezuela has a 2,000km (1,200-mile) border. The government accused him of treason, terrorism and incitement to hatred.Maduro's dramatic capture by US special forces on 3 January has encouraged families of opposition and human rights figures arrested under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez to step up their campaign for releases.Venezuela has long denied holding political prisoners, but families and rights advocates have demanded charges against detainees be dropped. Opposition politicians, journalists, and activists have faced charges including terrorism and treason, which their families describe as arbitrary.The amnesty bill announced by Rodríguez is expected to be approved by the National Assembly in the coming days. Its aim, the acting president said, is to \"heal the wounds of political confrontation, violence, and extremism\".Foro Penal has said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped.This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group added.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloCorbis via Getty ImagesCrown Princess Mette-Marit said she regretted having any contact with Epstein at allNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has said he agrees with Crown Princess Mette-Marit's admission of \"poor judgement\" after it emerged she had extensive contacts with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The princess features hundreds of times between 2011-14 in the latest files released by the US Department of Justice relating to Epstein.This latest embarrassment for the royal family comes on the eve of her son's seven-week trial in Oslo on 38 charges including rape and assault.Princess Mette-Marit married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon as a commoner when her son Marius Borg Høiby was four and is in line to become queen when her husband accedes to the throne.As the content of her email exchanges began to emerge, the princess released a statement on Saturday saying: \"I showed poor judgement and regret having any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.\" She went on to express her \"deep sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the abuses committed by Jeffrey Epstein\".Although the prime minister did not go further than agreeing with the princess's admission of poor judgement, his implicit criticism of her is considered unusual.  Støre said he also believed that ex-Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland had exercised \"poor judgement\", after it emerged that he had planned a family holiday on Epstein's private island, though he then cancelled it. Jagland was expected to make a statement on the issue on Monday.The latest cache of Epstein files suggests that the correspondence between Princess Mette-Marit and Epstein began in autumn 2011. The warm nature of the messages has appalled commentators in Norway. An email from the HRH Crown Princess account on 23 October 2011 implies she had by then become aware of his initial jail term in 2008. \"Googled u after last email,\" she wrote. \"Agree didn't look too good.\"By this time, Epstein was a registered sex offender.It also emerged that the crown princess spent four days at Epstein's house in Palm Beach, Miami in January 2013, when he was not present.In one email, Epstein was asked whether a mother should suggest naked women carrying a surfboard for her son's wallpaper.US Department of JusticeNorway's royal family has been buffeted by a succession of scandals of late, including the marriage of the crown prince's sister, Princess Märtha Louise to a self-styled American shaman.But the latest revelations concern the future queen of Norway, and the wider monarchy. Princess Mette-Marit is patron of several organisations including the Red Cross.Norwegians are already preparing for the trial of her son, Marius Borg Høiby, and questions are being asked about his mother's failure to realise the toxic nature of maintaining contact with Epstein, and especially the role of her advisers.Her 29-year-old son, who is not part of the royal family, denies the most serious charges against him. One charge of rape involves intercourse while a woman was asleep. Three others allege sexual assault while women were incapacitated, which also counts as rape in Norway.If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in prison.No member of the royal family will attend the trial, which starts at Oslo district court on Tuesday. However, in an emotional statement to reporters last week, Crown Prince Haakon said \"our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by this case... we understand that this is a difficult time for many of you, and we sympathise\".Although his stepson was not a member of the royal family, he said: \"We care about him, and he is an important member of our family.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, JerusalemandHafsa KhalilAFPAmbulances waiting at the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on Monday morningPalestinians have started to enter the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt after it reopened for the movement of people.The crossing has largely been closed since May 2024, when the Gazan side was captured by Israeli forces.The reopening was supposed to happen during the first phase of US President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, which began in October. But Israel blocked it until the return of the body of the last Israeli hostage in Gaza, which happened last week.It will come as a relief to many Palestinians who see it as a lifeline to the world, although there is frustration that only small numbers of people and no goods will be allowed through.Around 20,000 sick and wounded Palestinians are waiting to leave Gaza for treatment, according to local hospitals and the World Health Organization (WHO).Israeli reports say only 50 patients - accompanied by one or two relatives - will be allowed to exit each day, and that 50 people who left Gaza during the war will be allowed to return.The crossing will be run by supervisors from the European Union and local Palestinian staff, while Israel will carry out remote security checks.On Monday morning, an Israeli security official said the Rafah crossing had \"now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit\" following the arrival of teams from the European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM).Al Qahera News TV, which is close to Egyptian intelligence, meanwhile said the crossing had \"received the first batch of Palestinians returning from Egypt to the Gaza Strip\". It added that the move came \"as part of Egyptian efforts to facilitate movement through the crossing\".A Palestinian mother, Sabrine al-Da'ma, told the BBC she was hoping to travel abroad with her 16-year-old daughter, Rawa, who suffers from kidney disease. She plans to donate Rawa one of her kidneys.\"She used to be treated through monitoring, ultrasound imaging and tests to check the condition of her kidneys. Since the war started, because of food shortages, hunger, and the food she was forced to eat, she began dialysis,\" Da'ma said.\"We hope they will speed up our referral so that we can travel quickly, because she is getting exhausted. I am also 45 years old, and they may tell me that as I get older, I won't be able to donate anymore. That's why we're rushing.\"On Sunday, Israeli authorities said a trial opening of the crossing was carried out and completed.One Palestinian official familiar with the arrangements for the trial told the BBC that around 30 Palestinian staff members had arrived at the Egyptian side of the crossing, ahead of the initial operational phase.The WHO will oversee the transfer of patients from territory under Hamas control, transporting them by bus to the crossing over the so-called \"Yellow Line\" and into territory controlled by the Israeli military, the BBC understands.Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan says the reopening of the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under a previous ceasefire deal in January last year.Before being seized by Israel in 2024, the crossing was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the war and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. Now, aid that enters from Egypt is routed via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing point.In December, the Israeli government said the Rafah crossing would open to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza. But Egypt said the crossing would only be opened if movement was allowed in both directions. More than 30,000 Gazans have registered with the Palestinian embassy in Cairo to be allowed to return to Gaza.The crossing's opening was delayed due to the Israeli government making it conditional on Hamas handing over the body of the last dead Israeli hostage in Gaza.Last week, the Israeli military said its troops had retrieved the remains of police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili at a cemetery in northern Gaza.He was one of the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies during their attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed around 1,200 people.Israel's military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, has killed more than 71,790 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMadina MaishanuBBC Africa, AbujaBBCThe chairs strewn across the floor of one of the churches raided last month hints at the panic the attack caused Dozens of worshippers kidnapped by gunmen in Nigeria's northern Kaduna state have returned home weeks after their abduction, police have confirmed.They were among 177 people seized last month from three churches in the remote village of Kurmin Wali.The 80 people escaped on the day they were taken but hid in neighbouring villages for a fortnight \"due to fear of being captured again\", state police spokesman Mansur Hassan told the BBC.The authorities say efforts are ongoing to secure the release of the remaining 86 people still being held. The attack was part of a wave of kidnappings for ransom affecting many parts of Nigeria, but no group has said it was behind the abductions.The raid was initially denied by police, who only confirmed the kidnappings on 21 January after local residents had reported to the BBC that 177 worshippers were abducted, with 11 escaping shortly afterwards.The official response drew criticism from Amnesty International, which accused Nigerian authorities of \"desperate denial\".The rights group urged officials to \"take immediate and concrete measures to prevent rampant abductions that are gradually becoming the norm in Nigeria.\"In November, more than 300 students and teachers were taken from a Catholic school in Niger state, which neighbours Kaduna, before being released in two groups.Nigeria faces multiple, overlapping security challenges beyond kidnappings, including an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and frequent clashes between herders and farmers in central regions over land and water.Security experts say efforts to tackle these crises are hampered by corruption, poor intelligence sharing, and underfunded local police forces.The security situation has drawn international attention. In December, the US conducted airstrikes in north-western Nigeria on Christmas Day, targeting two camps run by an Islamist militant group.Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is home to more than 250 ethnic groups and is roughly divided between a predominantly Muslim north and a largely Christian south, with significant mixing in central regions. The government maintains that people of all faiths have been victims of the widespread violence.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

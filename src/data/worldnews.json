    "body": "<div><p>The \"area of interest\" flagged in a volunteer-led search for the body of a British girl who vanished in Australia 55 years ago has turned out to be a false alarm, New South Wales Police said.</p><p>A volunteer team who used cadaver detection dogs in search of Cheryl Grimmer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4qp95n0pzo\">had hoped their finding would be a breakthrough</a> in the case which has remained a mystery since she disappeared in 1970, when she was three.</p><p>But bones that were found in the area belong to an animal, police said in response to the BBC's queries, adding that the search had \"concluded\".</p><p>Authorities suspect Cheryl, who had emigrated from Bristol with her family, was abducted from Fairy Meadow beach in Wollongong in January 1970.</p></div><div><p>Thursday's search happened in Balgownie, on a small pocket of woodland mentioned in a confession made by a teenage boy.</p><p>In 2019, a trial of the suspect, known only by a codename, Mercury, who'd been charged with Cheryl's abduction and murder, collapsed. The man, in his 60s then, had denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Prosecutors later dropped charges against him as a judge disallowed the confession he made as a minor.</p><p>Authorities have conducted numerous searches in the decades since Cheryl disappeared, but have found few clues as to what happened to her. </p><p>NSW authorities have offered a A$1m ($660,000; £491,000) reward for information on Cheryl's abduction and suspected murder.</p><p>Cheryl's brother Ricki Nash, 62, has publicly highlighted what he believes are errors in the police investigation dating back to the day she went missing.</p><p>Mr Nash was seven then. He last saw his sister in the changing rooms at Fairy Meadow on the day she disappeared.</p><p>A petition asking the state parliament to set up an inquiry into missing persons investigations overseen by NSW Police, such as Cheryl's, gathered more than 10,000 signatures this summer.</p><p>It was debated in parliament, but in a letter responding to petitioners, state authorities made no commitment to holding an inquiry.</p><p><i>With reporting by Tiffanie Turnbull in Sydney</i></p></div>",

The ministry said authorities were in the process of deporting the others.</p><p>The deportations come as the last boat of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) was intercepted by Israeli authorities on Friday morning.</p><p>The GSF called Israel's interceptions illegal, while Israel described the flotilla's actions as a \"provocation\".</p><p>The blocking of the flotilla sparked protests around the world, including a general strike in Italy.</p></div><div><p>The first boats were stopped on Wednesday about 70 nautical miles off the Gaza coast in international waters and others closer. Israel has been policing this area but does not have jurisdiction there.</p><p>Israel said its navy had told the boats to change course as they were \"approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade\", while the GSF said the interceptions were \"illegal\".</p><p>In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said: \"Already four Italian citizens have been deported. The rest are in the process of being deported. Israel is keen to end this procedure as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>It added that all detainees were safe and in good health. The GSF has alleged that many activists were assaulted with water cannon while their boats were intercepted. </p><p>The foreign ministry's statement mentioned the presence of Swedish activist Greta Thunberg on one of the boats, but did not give further details on her status.</p><p>In a statement on Friday morning, the GSF said: \"Over 38 hours, Israeli occupation naval forces illegally intercepted all 42 of our vessels—each carrying humanitarian aid, volunteers, and the determination to break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza.\" </p><p>It said the last of its boats, the Marinette, was illegally intercepted at 10:29 local time on Friday, approximately 42.5 nautical miles from Gaza in international waters.</p><p>\"Live streams and communications have been cut, and the status of participants and crew remains unconfirmed,\" the GSF said.</p><p>\"This is an illegal attack on unarmed humanitarians. We call on governments and international institutions to demand their immediate safety and release,\" it added.</p><p>In a livestream from the Marinette, one passenger was seen holding up a piece of paper to the camera reading \"We see a ship!\" just before 10:00 local time (8:00 BST).</p><p>About half an hour later, a dinghy full of armed troops wearing tactical gear pulled alongside the Marinette, with a much larger military vessel visible in the background.</p><p>The latest data on the Marinette, via the flotilla's tracking website, put it 43 nautical miles (80km) from the Gaza coast at 10:07 - shortly before it was boarded.</p><p>The majority of the vessels sailing as part of the flotilla are not visible on ship tracking sites reviewed by BBC Verify.</p><p>Five of the vessels intercepted on Thursday are now moored at the Israeli Ashdod Naval Base, tracking website Marine Traffic showed on Friday morning.</p><p>The BBC has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) whether it plans to return the vessels to their owners and how long those detained will be held.</p><p>The GSF flotilla set sail for Gaza from Spain at the end of last month, with other boats joining from Tunisia and other ports later, the GSF said. </p><p>Protests in support of the flotilla and against the war in Gaza ramped up around the world as the boats neared the Strip, in countries including Spain, Italy, Colombia and Argentina.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Matt Murphy and Richard Irvine-Brown</i></p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>South Africa's highest court has unanimously ruled that all parents of new-borns are entitled to equal parental leave - a landmark judgment hailed as a major victory for gender equality and family rights.</p><p>Under the current law, mothers are granted four months of leave, while fathers receive just 10 days. </p><p>In its ruling, the Constitutional Court declared parts of the legislation unconstitutional, calling it discriminatory against fathers, and ruled that both parents may now share the granted leave however they choose.</p><p>\"This is a ground-breaking step for equality, family wellbeing, and the future of fatherhood in South Africa,\" said Sthembiso Phakathi, founder of Single Dads Network. </p></div><div><p>In 2023, a lower court found certain sections of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCE) Act and the Unemployment Insurance Fund Act (UIF)  unjust and ruled that they violated the rights of various family structures.</p><p>The Gauteng High Court then ruled that the law unfairly treated types of parents differently regarding the length of parental leave and unemployment benefits received.</p><p>The case was brought to court by a married couple, the Commission for Gender Equality and others, who sought to address the unfair societal burden placed primarily on mothers, highlighting that parenting responsibilities should be shared.</p><p>The petitioners argued that the current legislation unfairly discriminated against parents who were not the birth mother - specifically, fathers, adoptive parents, and parents of children born to surrogates - by granting them only 10 days of parental leave, while the birth mother received four months.</p><p>Delivering the ruling on Friday, Justice Zukisa Tshiqi said that both parents should be entitled to share the available days as they saw fit, describing the current law outdated and one which \"unfairly burdened mothers and excluded fathers\".</p><p>\"The protection of birth mothers to the exclusion of other parents has the unfortunate consequence of perpetrating the assumption that women are, and should be, the primary caregivers of children. </p><p>\"The father is marginalised and deprived of the opportunity to involve himself as a parent in the upbringing of the baby during the early stages of life,\" she added. </p><p>Justice Tshiqi said the ruling was not only about gender equality but also about protecting the dignity of families, emphasising that the ultimate focus of the court's decision was the wellbeing of children.</p><p>\"The unequal treatment not only marginalises parents but also deprives children of the opportunity to be with their caregivers during a crucial period of nurturing and adjustment to their new environment.\"</p><p>The petitioners welcomed the ruling, while legal experts warned that the decision would have far-reaching implications for employers, who will need to adjust their current leave policies to comply with the judgement. </p><p>\"The essence of the case is that it highlights the need to provide equal parental leave benefits, recognising that nurturing a child is a shared responsibility,\" Tsietsi Shuping from the Commission for Gender Equality told the BBC. </p><p>He said the current law \"did not reflect evolving societal norms around parenting\".  </p><p>Labour lawyer Patrick Deale told state media that the judgment was \"a positive and expected outcome\" for parental rights in the country.</p><p>The court has suspended its declaration of invalidity for three years, giving parliament time to amend the current laws to align with its judgement. </p><p>In the meantime, parents will be entitled to decided how they want to share the four months and 10 days of leave. </p><p>If only one parent is employed, that parent may take the full leave allocation.</p></div>",

The national energy watchdog and Spanish lawmakers are also conducting separate investigations.</p><p>The Spanish government believes the Entso-e report supports its own findings.</p><p>Sara Aagesen, minister for ecological transition, said it was \"completely in line\" with the results of an investigation it commissioned which concluded in June that both the national grid provider Red Eléctrica and private electricity companies were at fault.</p><p>Both Red Eléctrica and the private firms have insisted that they were not to blame. Redeia, owner of Red Eléctrica, has blamed the blackout on some coal, gas and nuclear power plants' failure to help maintain appropriate voltage.</p><p>Spanish utilities said it was caused by poor planning from grid operators.</p><p>The Entso-e report also said some important data was missing and that \"collecting complete, high-quality data proved very challenging for this investigation\".</p><p>A final report, to be published in the first quarter of next year, will investigate the root causes of the overvoltage and the actions employed to control voltage in the system.</p></div><div><p>The outage triggered a broader debate that spilled into the political arena about Spain's energy model.</p><p>The opposition suggested an increasingly heavy reliance on renewable energy, promoted by the left-wing government of Pedro Sánchez, could have been a factor in causing the blackout and the country's decreasing supply of nuclear energy meant a dependable back-up was not available.</p><p>The government roundly rejected these theories and the new report was careful to avoid taking sides when it came to the causes of April's unprecedented blackout.</p><p>The loss of power forced Madrid Open Tennis organisers to stop a match half way through play. </p><p>Spain's nuclear power plants automatically stopped when the blackout hit, and the Spanish oil company Moeve said it halted operations at its oil refineries.</p><p>Buildings <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c175ykvjxyeo\">were plunged into darkness</a>, while mobile phones and traffic lights stopped working. Queues snaked around street corners and card payments failed, forcing people to queue for cash and cram on to buses as other transport systems were not running. </p><p>Emergency workers were called to 286 buildings to free people trapped inside elevators in the Madrid region and hospitals implemented emergency plans, halting routine procedures. </p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>US federal workers have described their state of uncertainty, with many now on unpaid leave due to a government shutdown and one remarking that their salary was being \"held hostage\".</p><p>Workers deemed to be essential may still be on duty or at their desks, but they too may not be paid while the shutdown lasts.</p><p>A government shutdown is a familiar situation in the US, and can happen whenever Congress fails to vote through an annual budget. This one began on Wednesday, and this deadlock is characterised by partisan disputes over federal spending and Democratic demands to extend healthcare tax credits.</p><p>What makes this shutdown different is the fact that President Donald Trump hopes to use the opportunity to make permanent cuts to government staffing and spending.</p><p>BBC News has been speaking to federal workers about their views and how the shutdown has affected them.</p><p>Although most of the comments below are anonymous, we have verified that the speakers are federal workers. US government staff are generally forbidden from speaking to the media, and we have protected the speakers' identities because they could face disciplinary action if they are named.</p></div><div><p>\"The last shutdown was brutal\", said one federal worker, who highlighted that the impasse in 2018-19 lasted more than a month.</p><p>He added: \"It forced me to withdraw money from my retirement plan just to cover my bills. Now, they've made it more difficult to withdraw from our retirement accounts, so if this goes as long as the last shutdown, I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills.\"</p><p>The same worker said: \"I voted for Trump, but I did not vote for his abuses against us.\"</p><p>Another worker, for the Department of Homeland Security, based in New Jersey, took a slightly different view: \"Despite working without timely pay, I support the shutdown.\" </p><p>He explained: \"The president's circumvention of Congress' power of the purse has been left unchecked by the Supreme Court. Checks and balances must be maintained.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a worker for Army Corps of Engineers said she was \"rather conflicted\" and did not mind a break from the \"gruelling end of fiscal year - a year full of constantly shifting guidance and the ever-present threat\" of a mass firing.</p><p>She said she would \"support a shutdown if anything productive comes of it, but I'm unsure anything will\".</p><p>Randall from Kansas City, who works with the Aviation Weather Center, said: \"I don't like my pay being held hostage while the government fights over separate issues.\"</p><p>He said he believed that keeping the National Weather Service funded was something both parties typically agreed, so asked why he was \"facing sudden loss of funds because Congress is fighting over healthcare or whatever\". He emphasised that these were his personal views, and not those of his agency.</p><p>An anonymous US Air Force employee told us that if the situation was not resolved, he would have nothing to live on. He expressed his dilemma as follows: \"I must still show up to work but won't get paid, because if I don't it's considered AWOL\".</p><p>A worker at the Department of the Treasury had a message to the party holding out against the spending plans of Trump's Republican party.</p><p>\"I strongly implore Democrats to stand firm and not cave to the continued assault on healthcare and affordability for everyday Americans,\" she said. She added that no amount of threats to her job would cause her to waver in her views.</p></div><p><i>Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell, Mary Litchfield, Alex Akhurst and Imogen James</i></p>",

They have been rallying mainly through social media, and do not have a formal leadership structure. </p><p>Official statistics show that Morocco's unemployment rate stands at 12.8%, with youth unemployment soaring to 35.8% and 19% among graduates, news agency Reuters reports. </p><p>Protests have also hit the capital, Rabat, the main commercial city, Casablanca, and the port city of Tangier - the arrival point for tourists going to Morocco by ferry from Spain. </p><p>Morocco's tourist hub, Marrakesh, was also hit by violence, with protesters burning a police station, according to local media.</p><p>Interior ministry spokesman Rachid El Khalfi said that 409 people have been  detained across Morocco following the unrest. </p><p>More than 260 police officers and 20 protesters have been injured, while 40 police vehicles and 20 private cars have been torched, he was quoted as saying.</p><p>The uprising follows similar youth-led, large scale demonstrations this summer in Nepal, Indonesia, the Philippines and Madagascar.</p><p>The uprising in Nepal led to the prime minister resigning, while Madagascar's president dissolved his government on Monday in an attempt to placate the protesters there.</p><p>Morocco's governing coalition issued a statement on Tuesday expressing willingness to engage in dialogue with the youth \"within institutions and public spaces to find realistic solutions\".</p><p>It also praised what it called \"the balanced reaction of security authorities in line with relevant legal procedures\".</p></div>",

Britain has half a dozen dedicated military satellites in orbit providing communications and surveillance. </p><p>In contrast, the US, China and Russia each have more than a hundred. The combined Russian and Chinese fleet of satellites has increased by 70% over the past decade. </p><p>Gen Tedman said Russia and China had both tested anti-satellite weapons. Both the UK and the US have warned that Russia has been developing the capability to put nuclear weapons in space. </p><p>While the US sees China as the pacing threat, Gen Tedman sees Russia as the more immediate danger: \"I would say the Chinese have by far the more sophisticated capability but the Russians have more will to use their counter-space systems.\"</p><p>Gen Tedman said he was \"really worried\" about what was happening in space – not just the threats but the increasing congestion. There are currently about 45,000 objects in orbit including around 9,000 satellites.

It is home to Britain and America's Ballistic Missile Early Warning System. It is a job they has been doing since 1963.</p><p>The three famous large radomes or \"golf balls\" from the Cold War era have been replaced by a 30-metre (98-ft) pyramid which houses thousands of antennas.</p><p>It looks like a spaceship has landed on the North Yorkshire moors, surrounded by sheep, an electrified perimeter fence and razor wire. </p><p>The unblinking eye provides 360 degree coverage from the Arctic to North Africa, and from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Its radar can track objects the size of a tin can, 3,000 miles (4,800km) into space.</p><p>Inside, the heavy blast doors and air locks tell you that his too could be a target for any adversary. In the operations room, UK military personnel watch round the clock, every day of the year. </p><p>The RAF's 2 Space Warning Squadron take us through the drill of how they detect a missile launch. They are plugged into other US satellites and sensors that enable them to detect a launch anywhere in the world. </p><p>Gen Tedman calls space \"a team sport\" but, in reality, the UK is heavily reliant on America. The US has responsibility for the maintenance of the radar with the support of UK contractors.</p><p>The UK officer in charge of the watch says along with other sources \"we'd know the UK was under threat probably within a minute\".</p><p>What is mentioned less is the UK's ability to intercept ballistic missiles. Currently the UK has very little in the way of ballistic missile defence.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp\" alt=\"The exterior of the air force base.

It is also taking steps to defend its satellites. This week it is announcing it will test sensors to detect laser threats in space.</p><p>Both China and Russia have developed lasers which could be used to dazzle and disrupt an adversary's satellites. </p><p>Gen Tedman said: \"We've committed to invest a billion pounds into integrated air and missile defence, and I'd be surprised if there's not a space aspect to how we're going to defend the UK from threats very similar to [America's] Golden Dome.\"</p><p>He was referring to President Donald Trump's plan to build a shield around the US against any missile attacks. </p><p>However, the UK is in danger of being left behind in the space race. Currently it spends about 1% of its defence budget on space. In contrast, France spends about 3% and the US 5%.</p><p>Gen Tedman would like to see space given a higher priority. He says around £450bn  of the UK economy is dependent on space. It is also the nervous system on which the UK's armed forces increasingly depend – from navigation to precision strikes.</p><p>Before we leave RAF Fylingdales, there is another reminder why space is so important. </p><p>We are warned we will have to leave the operations room if there is a real-life incident. While we are filming another alert comes through of a ballistic missile launch and we are swiftly escorted to the exit. </p><p>They are observing short-range ballistic missile launches almost every day. In this incident they will not say from where but it is no secret Russia has been firing them regularly into Ukraine. </p><p>In 2024 more than 4,000 missiles were fired around the globe. Russia was the reason why Flyingdales was first created in the Cold War era. The threat has not gone away.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

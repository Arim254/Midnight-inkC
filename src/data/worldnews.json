    "body": "Korean coast guard arrests helmsman who was on his phone when ferry ran aground4 hours agoGeorge Wright and Leehyun Choi'I thought I might die': Passenger on South Korea ferry that ran aground speaks outTwo people have been arrested and a boat captain is under investigation after a ferry ran aground on rocks off South Korea's south-west coast. All 267 passengers and crew on board the Queen Jenuvia 2 were rescued after it became stuck near the uninhabited island of Jogdo, off the coast of Jangsan Island in Shinan County, on Wednesday. Twenty-seven people sustained minor injuries from the impact of grounding.The coast guard told the BBC they had arrested the helmsman and the first mate for gross negligence resulting in injuries.The helmsman initially blamed a steering wheel malfunction, but later admitted he had been on his phone and missed the point at which he was supposed to change course.The vessel has now docked at a nearby port.Authorities say they are still investigating the exact cause of the accident.Some passengers described it in real time on social media. \"There was a loud bang, and then the ship tilted,\" one was quoted as saying by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. \"An announcement told everyone to put on life jackets, so we're wearing them and waiting on the top deck.\"The 26,000-tonne ferry was travelling to the port city of Mokpo after departing from the resort island of Jeju, officials said.The area is near the site where the Sewol ferry sunk in 2014. More than 300 people were killed in that incident, mostly children heading for a school trip.The salvaged wreck of the Sewol ferry was brought to Mokpo nearly three years later.Describing Wednesday's incident, Kim Namhyun, a diving instructor on Jeju Island, told Reuters: \"I thought I might die. The sound was too loud.\"But having seen the Sewol ferry, I knew that in situations like this, you have to stay calm, move outside, wear a life jacket, and wait.\"",

    "body": "A woman has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for her role in the murders of three tourists during a carjacking in Mexico last year.Ari Gisell, 23, pleaded guilty to instigating the violent assault on Australian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their American friend Carter Rhoad, who were on a surfing trip in the northern Mexican state of Baja California in April 2024 when they disappeared.Their bodies were later found with gunshot wounds to the head at the bottom of a deep well.Ari Gisell had expressed interest in the tyres on the surfers' car and told her then-boyfriend Jesús Gerardo to \"bring me a good phone and good tyres for my pickup truck\", the court heard.Only the first and middle names of the defendants were revealed. Surnames were not, in line with Mexican court reporting rules.Jesús Gerardo and two others, Irineo Francisco and Ángel Jesús, tailed the vehicle to the campsite where the foreigners were staying, then robbed them before shooting them dead. The cases against these three men are still before the courts.According to Mexican newspaper La Silla Rota, Jesús Gerardo and Irineo Francisco have ties with the powerful drug cartel Sinaloa, which was for many years led by the notorious drug lord Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán.Because of these links, both men are being held in El Hongo, a maximum-security prison in Baja California. Ángel Jesús has been detained in a separate facility in the city of Ensenada.Prosecutors do not suspect any connections between the murders and organised crime, however, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).The victims' families, who appeared via video conference, made emotional statements at the hearing on Wednesday.\"We dreamed of seeing them grow older, of having children. That's all taken now,\" said Callum and Jake's mother Debra Robinson, as reported by ABC. \"We live with their absence.\"Callum Robinson, 33, was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and was living in San Diego, just across the US-Mexico border from Baja California.His younger brother Jake, 30, lived in Australia and had travelled to North America to visit Callum. He was due to start a new job as a doctor when he returned.Their friend Rhoad, 30, was a San Diego resident and worked in a technology services company. Rhoad was months away from marrying his fiancee when he was killed.\"He was my safety in the world,\" his fiancee Natalie Wiertz told the court. \"My life is now a nightmare.\"Ari Gisell gave a tearful apology in court, acknowledging that \"nothing I can say will compensate you or give you peace\".\"I am focused on being a better person, and I am very sorry for your losses,\" said the single mother, as quoted by La Silla Rota.",

    "body": "One of the world's first calculating machines will not go to auction as scheduled in France, after a Paris court provisionally blocked the historic item from being exported.Auction house Christie's has confirmed it will not proceed with bidding for the machine La Pascaline, developed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal in 1642.Valuations suggested the machine could fetch €2m to 3m (£1.7m to £2.6m), and Christie's called it the \"most important scientific instrument ever offered at auction\".Scientists and researchers made a legal appeal to grant heritage protections to the historic instrument, arguing it should be classified as a \"national treasure\".Pascal was just 19 years old when he developed the earliest version of a calculator, Christie's said. There are only nine of these machines still in existence.\"It is the first attempt in history to substitute the human mind with a machine,\" the official collection description reads.\"Its invention marks a breakthrough, a 'quantum leap' whose importance and significance take on a very special meaning today.\"La Pascaline was exhibited at Christie's venues in New York and Hong Kong throughout the year. The machine was included in Christie's auction of the library of the late Catalonia collector Léon Parcé, which also featured Pascal's philosophical piece Pensées and the first printed version of \"Pascal's wager\".On Wednesday, a Paris administrative court temporarily blocked an earlier export authorisation provided by France's culture minister in May. Two experts had signed off on the minister's certificate, including one from the Louvre Museum.The judge concluded there were \"serious doubts\" over the legality of the certificate, a statement from the Paris court said, adding the decision was provisional until a final judgment is delivered.In a statement to the AFP news agency, a Christie's spokesperson said: \"Given the provisional nature of this decision and in accordance with the instructions of its client, Christie's is suspending the sale of La Pascaline.\" The court noted La Pascaline's historic and scientific value could qualify it as a \"national treasure\", guaranteeing protections under the France's heritage code.The French heritage group Association Sites & Monuments, which was listed as an applicant in the court filing, welcomed the decision.Additional reporting by Sebastian Usher, Global Affairs reporter",

    "body": "A portrait by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt was sold for $236.4m (£179m) in New York on Tuesday, making it the second-most expensive piece ever sold at auction. Six people took part in a 20-minute bidding battle for the Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer which was painted between 1914 and 1916. Auction house Sotheby's has not disclosed the buyer's identity.The portrait was looted by the Nazis and almost destroyed in a fire in World War Two, but was rescued in 1948. The artwork was returned to Lederer's brother, Erich, a friend and subject of Klimt's contemporary, Egon Schiele. The piece remained in Lederer's possession for most of his life, before he sold it in 1983, according to Sotheby's. The painting shows Lederer, an heiress and the daughter of one of Klimt's patrons, wearing a white robe and standing in front of a blue tapestry covered in Asian motifs. The Nazis, who annexed Austria in 1938, looted the Lederer art collection but left family portraits behind, says the National Gallery of Canada. Estée Lauder heir Leonard A Lauder made it part of his private collection in 1985, where it was displayed in his Fifth Avenue home in New York. Tuesday's sale shot past expectations, with the painting predicted to sell for  $150m before the auction. The second-highest sale for a Klimt on record was Lady with a Fan, which sold for $108.8m in 2023 in London. Several other Klimt works in Lauder's collection were auctioned at the same event, including Flowering Meadow and Forest Slope at Unterach am Attersee, which fetched between $60m and $80m each. The most expensive artwork ever sold at auction was Salvator Mundi, attributed to  Leonardo da Vinci, which sold in 2017 for $450.3m.Tuesday also saw a sculpture of a fully functioning gold toilet by the conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan picking up $12.1m just an hour after the record-breaking Klimt sale.The 101-kg toilet received just one bid. Sotheby's said that the buyer was a famous American brand.",

    "body": "13 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterEPAAlbania's prime minister accused Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood of \"ethnic stereotyping\" after she singled out Albanian families in a speech about abuses of the asylum system.Edi Rama criticised Mahmood for telling MPs around 700 Albanian families were \"living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims\" as she announced major reforms on Monday.Rama called the number a \"statistical drop in the ocean of post-Brexit Britain's challenges\".Official data show the UK has deported more than 13,000 people to Albania since a returns deal was signed in 2022. Rama called the deal one of \"Europe's most successful partnerships on illegal migration.\"Mahmood's comments came as she announced major changes to the UK's \"out of control and unfair\" asylum system.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: \"If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.\"The reforms will make refugee status temporary, extend the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20, and allow the removal of families with children who have no right to remain. Alongside tightening access to refugee status, the UK would create new legal routes to the UK, with an annual cap on numbers.As part of her speech, Mahmood told MPs \"we must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are\".\"There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims - despite an existing returns agreement, and Albania being a signatory to the European convention on human rights,\" she added.Posting on social media, Rama said: \"How can a Labour Home Secretary so poorly echo the rhetoric of the populist far-right – and single out 700 Albanian families, a statistical drop in the ocean of post-Brexit Britain's challenges – precisely at a moment when the UK and Albania have built one of Europe's most successful partnerships on illegal migration?\"\"Let us also be clear: Albanians are net contributors to the British economy, and the number of Albanians receiving UK benefits is very low relative to other communities. \"To single them out again and again is not policy - it is a troubling and indecent exercise in demagoguery.\"Official policy should never be driven by ethnic stereotyping. That is the very least humanity expects from the great Great Britain.\"Rama has repeatedly clashed with British politicians over their descriptions of Albanian nationals. In May, Sir Keir Starmer travelled to the Albanian capital Tirana only to be told by Rama he would not host UK \"return hubs\" for failed asylum seekers from other countries.During the same press conference, Rama accused the previous Conservative government of \"stigmatising\" Albanians and warning that \"cursing the Albanians was not a good idea, because the curse went back and they are now out of the parliament\".A combative figure on social media, Rama has also previously invited Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to come to Albania to debate his claim one in 50 Albanians in Britain were in prison. Rama dismissed the figure as \"bonkers\" and accused Farage of peddling \"post-truth Brexit playbook\" politics. ",

    "body": "17 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Guy Delauney,Balkans correspondentAFPThe club's owner, nearest the camera, is among those on trialThirty-five people and three institutions have gone on trial in North Macedonia over a devastating fire at a nightclub that killed 63, mainly young, people in March.\"I know about the pain of loved ones, we are all parents,\" Judge Diana Gruevska-Ilievska told the crowded courtroom, filled with defendants and dozens of victims' relatives. She promised the case would be conducted in a transparent and disciplined manner.Club Pulse, in the eastern town of Kocani, was packed with young Macedonians attending a concert by a popular hip-hop duo when sparks from pyrotechnic devices set fire to the ceiling.Prosecutors told the trial that years of failings had turned the club into a death trap.Three former mayors of Kocani, the nightclub's owner and public licensing officials are among those charged. They are accused of endangering public safety by allowing an unsafe venue to operate. The judge warned the court that the trial could last for \"five months or five years\".Defence lawyers attempted to delay the start of proceedings due to the charges being merged into a single case. The judge rebuffed them, ruling this did \"not violate any rights of the parties\".At the time of the tragedy, authorities said only one proper exit was functioning at the club as the back door had been locked.Sparks from the pyrotechnics spread quickly on the club's ceiling, which had been made of flammable material.About 500 people were inside the club at the time, leaving 59 dead and some 200 others injured. Four of the injured died later. Many were unable to escape because of blocked exits.Outrage after the fire prompted protests in the Macedonian capital Skopje and elsewhere, with victims' families organising local marches in Kocani itself. AFP via Getty ImagesLast Saturday, victims' families marched through the centre of Skopje holding pictures of those who diedAnother protest entitled \"March of the Angels\" took place in Skopje days before the trial began, organised under a Macedonian social media campaign called \"Who's Next?\". Prosecutors told the trial that the Kocani disaster was not the result of one person's actions or mistakes - rather it arose out of a series of institutional failures and a lack of responsibility.None of the defendants had wanted to face up to the danger that had been there for years, according to prosecutor Borche Janev.Prosecutors allege that licences for the club were issued unlawfully, inspections were not carried out and overcrowding was allowed at the venue. Another allegation is that there was no permit for the band to set off the pyrotechnic devices that started the fire.\"If we remain silent and lose the truth... we will never have the strength as a society to embark on a path to healing,\" Janev was quoted by local media as telling the court.",

The artefacts, originally collected in the 1920s by Germany's then-envoy to Ethiopia Franz Weiss and his wife Hedwig, were handed over on Wednesday to the Institute of Ethiopian Studies at Addis Ababa University.The collection included crowns, shields and paintings, all considered culturally and historically significant in Ethiopia. \"The artefacts still stand as a symbol of the long-standing and friendly relationship between Germany and Ethiopia,\" said Ferdinand von Weyhe, Germany's envoy to Ethiopia. Professor Ramon Wyss, whose father was born during the family's diplomatic posting in Ethiopia, handed over the items at a ceremony attended by Tourism Minister Selamawit Kassa.He said the family's intention to return the artefacts was to \"share their beauty with the public and preserve the culture and history connected to my father's birth\". Ethiopia's Tourism MinistryThe pieces are set to be opened to the public for research and academic studyThe items were either gifts or purchases, according to the family. \"I would like to thank Professor Weiss's family for practically expressing their profound love for Ethiopia by meticulously preserving these artifacts and crucially ensuring their return to their rightful homeland,\" said the tourism minister.She added that the pieces would soon be opened to the public for research and academic study, terming the move a milestone in safeguarding Ethiopia's cultural heritage.\"Efforts will continue to bring back ancient artifacts that are found in the hands of individuals and institutions all over the world,\" she said. During colonial rule in Africa, thousands of cultural artefacts were plundered. The call by African countries for the return of looted items has been met with some success in recent years - though some items are only on loan.In 2022, Germany was the first country to return some of the famous Benin Bronzes to Nigeria in a bid to deal with its \"dark colonial history\".You may also be interested in: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

He is due to be removed from Italy under German police escort in the next few days.Prosecutors believe Mr Kuznetsov coordinated and led a group that planted explosives on the pipes deep beneath the Baltic Sea in 2022, though they have not disclosed any evidence.The case has serious implications for relations between Ukraine and Germany, which is the biggest source of military aid for Kyiv in Europe.Mr Kuznetsov's lawyer said his client \"feels like a scapegoat\" and is \"very sad\" that his government has not spoken out in his defence, or even confirmed that he was a serving soldier at the time of the blasts.\"If he carried out the attack, then he did so because he was ordered to do so because he was for sure a captain of the Ukrainian army,\" Nicola Canestrini said after Wednesday's hearing.The BBC has seen a copy of Mr Kuznetsov's military ID among the court papers. He has not commented publicly on whether he was involved in the explosions.\"The Ukrainian government knows exactly where he was every day of September 2022,\" his lawyer said. \"So, if he's innocent, why don't they say it? If he did it, why don't they say it? That's his question.\"The BBC has approached government and security sources in Kyiv, but they have not commented.Mr Kuznetsov was arrested in northern Italy in late August, at a glamping site near the city of Rimini where he had booked in for a few nights with his wife and two of their children.His passport details were entered online at check-in, and in Italy that information is automatically transferred to the carabinieri, the local police.Later that night, officers came knocking at the family's door.Serhiy Kuznetsov's lawyer Nicola Canestrini says his client feels like a \"scapegoat\"A month later, a second Ukrainian suspect was detained at his home close to Poland's capital Warsaw on another arrest warrant issued by Germany.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, an amateur deep-sea diver, has lived in Poland with his family since just before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.He was held in custody for 17 days, but a court then refused to extradite him.The judge delivered a passionate speech, arguing that no Ukrainian could be prosecuted for what he characterised as a legitimate act of self-defence against Russia's \"bloody and genocidal\" invasion of Ukraine.In Italy, further from Ukraine, the mood and the politics are very different.Mr Canestrini described the Italian appeal court's ruling as a \"great disappointment\", but said the fight for his client would now move to Germany - with the aim of having Mr Kuznetsov acquitted on the same grounds.Many Ukrainians consider whoever did destroy Nord Stream to be heroes for taking out an important revenue source for Russia, and struggle to understand why Germany - a key ally of Ukraine - is pursuing this prosecution.On Wednesday, one man stood outside the palatial courthouse in Rome wrapped in a Ukrainian flag and holding a poster that read: \"Serhiy Kuznetsov is a defender, not a criminal.\"",

    "body": "19 hours agoDearbail Jordan and Simon AtkinsonYounger Australian teenagers on Instagram, Facebook and Threads are being told their accounts will be shut down ahead of the country's social media ban for under-16s.Meta, which owns the three brands, said it had begun notifying users it believes to be between 13 and 15 years old by text, email and in-app messages that their accounts would start being deactivated from 4 December.The ban in Australia comes into force on 10 December. It affects a number of platforms which also include TikTok, YouTube, X and Reddit.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the \"world-leading\" ban was aimed at \"letting kids be kids\". Meta and other firms oppose the measure but said they would comply. Australia's internet regulator has estimated there are 150,000 Facebook users and 350,000 teens on Instagram in the 13-15 age bracket.From 4 December, children aged below 16 will not be able to create accounts on Meta's social media platforms. The company said it was asking young users to update their contact details so they could be notified when they became eligible to open an account. They can download and save their posts, videos and messages before their accounts are shut down.Meta said that teens who said they were old enough to use Instagram, Facebook and Threads could challenge the restriction by taking a \"video selfie\" to be used in facial age scans.They could also provide a driver's licence or other government issued-ID.All these verification methods were tested by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS) earlier this year, in a report commissioned by the Australian state.While the ACCS said that all methods had their merits, it added: \"We did not find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases, nor did we find solutions that were guaranteed to be effective in all deployments.\"Social media platforms which fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to block under-16s face fines of up to A$50m (£25m). \"While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be under the age of 16 by 10 December, compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process,\" Antigone Davis, vice-president and global head of safety at Meta, told Reuters Financial.Meta wants to see a law where under-16s have to get parental approval before they download a social media app. The firm told Australia's Seven News: \"Teens are resourceful, and may attempt to circumvent age assurance measures to access restricted services.\"But it said: \"We're committed to meeting our compliance obligations and are taking the necessary steps to comply with the law.\"Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said the ban was aimed at protecting teens \"from pressures and risks they can be exposed to while logged in to social media accounts\".In a move seemingly to avoid being included in the ban, gaming platform Roblox this week announced that children under 16 would be unable to chat to adult strangers.Mandatory age checks will be introduced for accounts using chat features, starting in December for Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, then the rest of the globe from January.The e-safety commissioner has published a list of which social media platforms will be impacted by the age ban.They are: FacebookInstagramKickRedditSnapchatThreadsTikTokX (formerly Twitter)YouTubePlatforms not included are:DiscordGitHubGoogle ClassroomLEGO PlayMessengerRobloxSteam and Steam ChatWhatsAppYouTube Kids",

    "body": "11 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondent, at COP30 in Belém, BrazilChris McGrath/Getty ImagesTurkey has proposed holding the 2026 climate talks in AntalyaThe COP31 climate meeting is now expected to be held in Turkey after Australia dropped its bid to host the annual event.Under the UN rules, the right to host the COP in 2026 falls to a group of countries made up of Western Europe, Australia and others.A consensus must be reached but neither country had been willing to concede. Australia has now agreed to support the Turkish bid in return for their minister chairing the talks following negotiations at COP30, currently being held in Brazil.This unusual arrangement has taken observers by surprise. It is normal for a COP president to be from the host country and how this new partnership will work in practice remains to be seen.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called the compromise with Turkey an \"outstanding result\" in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), noting Pacific issues would be \"front and centre\".He added that he had spoken to Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape and Prime Minister Rabuka of Fiji.However, Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told the AFP news agency \"we are all not happy. And disappointed it's ended up like this\".Solomon Islands leader Jeremiah Manele earlier told the ABC he would be \"disappointed\" if Australia didn't secure the event. Despite this, there will be relief among countries currently meeting at COP30 in the Brazilian city of Belém that a compromise has been reached as the lack of agreement on the venue was becoming an embarrassment for the UN.Australia has pushed hard to have the climate summit in the city of Adelaide, arguing that they would co-host the meeting with Pacific island states who are seen as among the most vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels.Turkey, which has proposed hosting COP31 in the city of Antalya, felt that they had a good claim to be the host country as they had stood aside in 2021 and allowed the UK to hold the meeting in Glasgow.If neither country was willing to compromise then the meeting would have been held in the German city of Bonn, the headquarters of the UN's climate body.As a result of discussions at COP30, a compromise appears to have been reached.This includes pre-COP meeting will be held on a Pacific island, while the main event is held in Turkey. Australia's climate minister Chris Bowen will be its president. AFP via Getty ImagesAustralia's climate minister Chris Bowen will be the COP31 president\"Obviously, it would be great if Australia could have it all, but we can't have it all,\" Mr Bowen told reporters outside the Australian delegation offices here in Belém.\"This process works on consensus, and consensus means if someone objected to our bid, it would go to Bonn.\"\"That would mean 12 months with a lack of leadership, no COP president in place, no plan, that would be irresponsible for multilateralism in this challenging environment.\"Mr Bowen believes having a COP president not from the host country will work and that he will have the considerable authority reserved for the president of these gatherings.\"As COP president of negotiations, I would have all the powers of the COP presidency to manage, to handle the negotiations, to appoint co-facilitators, to prepare draft text, to issue the cover decision,\" he said.He also confirmed to the BBC that Turkey will also appoint a president who will run the venue, organise the meetings and schedules.Australia's climbdown will be embarrassing for the government of Mr Albanese, after lobbying long and hard to win support among the other nations in the Western Europe group.The compromise will have to be ratified by more than 190 countries gathered here for COP30.Given the difficulties in getting to this compromise, there are unlikely to be any objections.",

    "body": "5 hours agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, in Istanbul and David GrittenAt least 25 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry has said, in what was one of the deadliest days since the ceasefire came into effect five weeks ago.Ten people were killed when a ministry of religious endowments building in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City was hit, according to rescuers.Israel's military said it struck \"Hamas terrorist targets\" after gunmen opened fire towards an area where its soldiers were operating in the southern city of Khan Younis in violation of the ceasefire deal.Hamas questioned the claim and denounced what it said was a \"dangerous escalation\" that could jeopardise the ceasefire.The flare-up of violence comes after the UN Security Council passed a resolution that endorsed US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan to end two years of devastating war.Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, told the BBC that Israeli air, drone and artillery strikes hit several locations in Gaza City and Khan Younis shortly after sunset on Wednesday.The attacks marked a sharp escalation after several days of relative calm, he said.The Civil Defence reported that the strike in Zeitoun caused severe damage to the religious endowments ministry's building and surrounding structures, and posted a video showing its rescue workers appearing to find two people buried under rubble.Photos published by the Anadolu news agency meanwhile showed the bodies of three young children reportedly recovered from the scene.In a separate incident in Gaza City, one person was killed and several others were wounded when a drone struck a group of people at Shejaiya junction on Salah al-Din Street, Gaza's main north-south road, according to Mr Bassal.He said another person was killed when a tank shell struck a house belonging to the Balboul family in Shejaiya's Mushtaha Street, which is also in eastern Gaza City.The Civil Defence reported that another 13 people were killed in the Khan Younis area.Mr Bassal said three of them were killed in a strike on a group inside a sports club run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa).In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that \"several terrorists opened fire toward the area where IDF soldiers are operating in Khan Younis\" earlier on Wednesday.\"This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement. No IDF injuries were reported,\" it added. \"In response, the IDF began striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip.\"Israeli public broadcaster Kan cited a security source as saying the targets of the strikes were the commander of the Zeitoun Battalion of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and the commander of its naval force.Hamas denounced the Israeli strikes, saying in a statement that it considered them a \"dangerous escalation through which the war criminal [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu seeks to resume the genocide against our people\".It also urged the US to \"honour its stated commitments and exert immediate pressure on Israel to enforce the ceasefire and halt its attacks\".But a US official told Reuters news agency that Hamas was aiming to break the ceasefire and not fulfil its commitment to disarm.On Monday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution that sought to shore up the fragile ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October.Member states authorised the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by President Trump, and a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which will be tasked with ensuring \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\".Trump hailed the resolution as \"a moment of true historic proportion\".Hamas reiterated that it would not give up its weapons without a Palestinian state, arguing its fight against Israel was legitimate \"resistance\".Israel's ambassador to the UN stressed the importance of disarmament, saying that his country would \"not stop or let up\" until Hamas no longer presented \"a threat\".The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks in Gaza since the ceasefire began and that its has targeted scores of fighters.On Wednesday afternoon, Israel's military also carried out several strikes in southern Lebanon saying it targeted weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah.Israel accuses the Iran-backed armed group of trying to rebuild its capabilities following a war that ended last November.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoJaroslav Lukiv, Laura Gozzi and Paul Kirby,Europe digital editorSenior Pentagon officials have arrived in Ukraine to \"discuss efforts to end the war\" with Russia, the US military has said.The team, led by US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, held talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko on Thursday morning. They are expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later in the day.Reports began surfacing on Wednesday that the US and Russia had prepared a new proposed framework to end the war, requiring major concessions from Ukraine including giving up territory and dramatically shrinking its military.It was reportedly drafted by President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev.Neither Washington nor Moscow have officially confirmed the plan. However, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X that achieving a \"durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions\". He said the US was consulting both sides of the conflict to \"develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war\".Driscoll's team is the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. He is joined by Army chief of staff Gen Randy George, top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue, and sergeant major of the army Michael Weimer. Details of the draft Witkoff-Dmitriev 28-point plan emerged more than three weeks after the two men are said to have spent three days in meetings in Miami, Florida.Citing people familiar with the matter, Axios, the Financial Times and Reuters reported that the plans call for Kyiv to give up areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine that it still controls, to cut significantly the size of its armed forces, and to forego many of its weapons.Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any territorial concessions to Russia.Kirill Dmitriev's team declined to comment on the reports. The BBC has also asked the White House and a representative for Witkoff to comment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that \"contacts\" had taken place with the US, but no \"consultations or negotiations\" were happening. Neither European nor Ukrainian officials are believed to have been involved in drafting the new proposal, sparking fears it could be overwhelmingly favourable to Russia. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned on Thursday that for any plan to work, it would need to have Ukrainians and Europeans on board, and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said \"the Ukrainians do not want any form of capitulation\".After meeting US officials, Ukraine's prime minister did not address the rumoured plan - but said their visit provided \"an opportunity for representatives of the American administration to assess the situation on the ground and see the consequences of Russian aggression\".Reports of the plan emerged on Wednesday, the same day Ukrainian officials said at least 26 people had been killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. Another 22 people were missing at the site, Zelensky said on Thursday. Zelensky was in Turkey at the time of the Ternopil attack, and unconfirmed Ukrainian reports suggested that talks had been planned with Trump's envoy in Ankara, but were called off.There was no mention of the proposed framework when the US army secretary arrived in Kyiv late on Wednesday. Army spokesman Col David Butler said only that Driscoll and his team were there \"on behalf of the [Trump] administration on a fact-finding mission to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war\".A Ukrainian official told CBS, the BBC's US media partner, that talks on the trip would focus on the military situation on the ground - as well as plans for a possible ceasefire. The unnamed official said: \"Presidents Zelensky and Trump have already agreed to stop the conflict along the existing lines of engagement, and there are agreements on granting security guarantees\".After talks with the US army secretary on Wednesday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal posted on X: \"We focused on the next steps for implementing the historic defence agreements reached by President Zelensky and President Trump.\"Kyiv and its Western allies, including the US, have been calling for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line, but Moscow has ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including ceding territory, tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.Meanwhile, a White House official confirmed to the BBC that special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg would leave his post in January.He reportedly decided that this would be a natural end to his time in the post, which requires Senate approval beyond 360 days.Kellogg has been seen as an important advocate for Ukraine in the White House during a time when Trump has often appeared to side with Russia in the conflict.

    "body": "2 days agoRaghvendra RaoBBC Hindi, BiharSeraj AliLalmunni Devi, who lost her husband to toxic liquor in 2022, says alcohol abuse upended her lifeNine years after imposing a statewide alcohol ban to curb addiction, domestic violence, and financial ruin among its poorest families, Bihar - India's poorest state - still struggles to gauge the policy's effectiveness.The gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers.Armed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery.On reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor.Vapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm.The officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived. \"They often get tipped off before a raid,\" an officer who didn't wish to be named said. Despite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains firmly in place in Bihar.Passed in 2016 by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after persistent demands from women's groups, the law was among the factors that helped his Janata Dal (United) - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance clinch a decisive state election victory earlier this month.State officials tout the policy's success by pointing to big numbers: since the law took effect, 1.1 million cases have been registered and 650,000 people convicted for violations. But the devil lies in the detail.More than 99% of these convictions are for consumption, rather than production, selling, or transport of illicit liquor. Moreover, alcohol remains widely available in the black market in Bihar. In the six weeks leading to the recently held election, illicit alcohol worth more than 522 million rupees ($6.26 million, £4.96 million) was seized from across the state. Seraj AliA makeshift setup of metal drums fermenting jaggery into country liquorSo why has Bihar been unable to enforce its ban more effectively?Local police, who did not want to come on record, say it is a combination of several factors - including staff shortages, increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods and possible collusion between liquor makers and authorities.\"There are laws that prescribe life imprisonment or even the death penalty for murder. But does that stop people from committing murder? No, it doesn't,\" said Ratnesh Sada, an outgoing minister whose department handled prohibition issues.Mr Sada, however, insisted that action has been taken against at least a hundred individuals engaged in illegal alcohol trade, with their properties seized.\"We destroy these setups, but within days they are up and running again,\" said Sunil Kumar, an excise official.Bihar's geography makes enforcement even harder. The landlocked state borders Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal -  all of which allow alcohol and serve as major sources of smuggled liquor. It also shares a 726km (449 mile), largely porous border with Nepal, which officials say has become a key conduit for alcohol smuggling, further complicating enforcement.Seraj AliBihar has a thriving black market in locally-brewed alcoholDespite the challenges, many women in Bihar -  who still carry deep scars from their husbands' alcohol abuse -  want the ban to continue.In Chhapra district, Lalmunni Devi, who lost her husband after he consumed toxic liquor in 2022, said her life had been upended by alcohol abuse.\"I just hope no one else has to suffer the same fate,\" she said.Neetu Devi, another widow, broke down as she recalled her husband's death.\"If the government were to shut down all such factories entirely, it [liquor] would no longer be available. It continues to be produced, and that's why people keep consuming it,\" she said.Rajeev Kamal Kumar, an anthropologist at Patna's AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, who worked on a government study of prohibition, says both sides of the story are true.\"Many women and elders say prohibition has improved household finances, children's education, and nutrition. But it is undeniable that illegal trade continues,\" he said.Bihar is neither the first nor the only Indian state to impose prohibition; several others have tried it over the years. But such measures often trigger unintended consequences - from thriving black markets and deaths from illicit brews, to enforcement challenges that drain state resources.The financial cost has also been considerable, as alcohol taxes remain a key source of revenue for many state governments.Gujarat and Nagaland have had bans since 1960 and 1989, yet both still grapple with bootlegging.Mizoram imposed prohibition in 1997, lifted it in 2015, reinstated it in 2019, and then relaxed it again in 2022 to allow the manufacture, sale and export of wine made from local grapes.Some other states have rolled back prohibition after encountering economic and administrative challenges.For now, with the outgoing government slated to return to power, prohibition will remain in Bihar. But the policy remains a paradox - hailed as a social reform by some, criticised as ineffective by others.Whether it has succeeded or merely shifted the problem underground is a question that continues to haunt the state.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance2 days agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countries\"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.Cho says that when she was younger, people didn't know what it meant to be Korean in the USAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "20 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisNICOLAS TUCAT/AFP via Getty ImagesAmine Kessaci was 17 when his first brother was killed - now he has lost anotherA prominent French anti-drugs campaigner whose brother was killed by drugs criminals last week,  five years after the murder of his elder brother, has vowed to stand up to intimidation and \"keep telling the truth about drugs violence\".Amine Kessaci, 22, was writing in Le Monde newspaper a day after the funeral of his younger brother Mehdi, whose murder last week has been described by the government as a turning-point in France's drugs wars.\"Yesterday I lost my brother. Today I speak out,\" he wrote in his opinion piece.\"[The drugs-traffickers] strike at us in order to break, to tame, to subdue. They want to wipe out any resistance, to break any free spirit, to kill in the egg any embryo of revolt.\"Mehdi Kessaci, 20, was shot dead last Wednesday as he parked his car in central Marseille in what appears to have been a warning or punishment aimed at his older brother, Amine, from the city's drugs gangs.Speaking after a ministerial meeting on drugs crime at the Elysée palace on Tuesday, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said: \"We all agreed that this premeditated murder was something totally new. It's clearly a crime of intimidation. It's a new level of violence.\"Mehdi was the second Kessaci brother to be killed by drugs criminals. In 2020 the body of Brahim Kessaci, then 22, was found in a burnt-out car. That murder prompted Amine to launch his association, Conscience, which aims to expose the damage to working-class communities caused by gangs.Marseille is renowned for worsening drugs wars, and Amine Kessaci recently wrote a book called Marseille Wipe your Tears – Life and Death in a Land of Drugs.AFP via Getty ImagesMehdi Kessaci, giving an interview last year at an event for his brotherIn his Le Monde article, Amine revealed he was recently warned by police to leave Marseille because of threats to his life. He attended his younger brother's funeral wearing a bullet-proof jacket and under heavy police protection.\"I speak because I have no choice but to fight if I don't want to die. I speak because I know that silence is the refuge of our enemies,\" he wrote, urging courage from citizens, and action from the government.Mehdi Kessaci's murder has brought the national spotlight back on a drugs trafficking problem that French experts and ministers agree is reaching almost unmanageable proportions.According to Senate member Étienne Blanc, author of a recent study, turnover in the drugs trade in France is now €7bn (£6bn) – or 70% of the entire budget of the justice ministry.He said around 250,000 people drew a living from the trade in France – more than the entire number of police and gendarmes, which is 230,000. According to Le Monde, the country counts 1.1 million users of cocaine.President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday launched a broadside against such consumers, telling the weekly cabinet meeting that \"sometimes it is the city-centre bourgeoisie that is funding the traffickers\".Macron had called a special drugs summit the day before in response to Mehdi's murder and in order to review progress on a new anti-drugs law that was passed in June.It sets up a special prosecutor's office dedicated to organised crime - similar to the office that tackles terrorism - which will eventually have 30 specialised magistrates.Under the law, senior drugs convicts are made to serve their terms in isolation in a specially converted prison where it is hoped it will be harder to continue running operations from behind bars.According to Laurent Nuñez, there is evidence that the crackdown on drugs crime is having an effect - with the number of homicides in Marseille down from 49 in 2023 to 24 in 2024. The number of dealing points in the city had halved from 160 to 80, he added.\"The war is not won, but we do have results.\"ALAIN JOCARD/AFP via Getty ImagesMembers of Parliament stand to pay tribute to Mehdi Kessaci on 13 NovemberAccording to the author of a recent book, Narcotraffic, Europe's poison, \"France is at the heart of the geopolitics of drugs. With its two major ports of Marseille and Le Havre, it has an ideal geographical position in this Europe of free movement.\"Mathieu Verboud said that the growth in world production of cocaine had triggered an \"explosion of supply and demand. The market has gone through the roof and so have the profits.\"The sheer wealth of drugs organisations meant they had the power to corrupt everyone from dock-workers to local politicians, the author warned, a process he said was already well-advanced in countries like the Netherlands and Belgium.Several French politicians have said it is time to call in the army to deal with drugs-trafficking and the gangs which hold sway in many high-immigration city estates.Christian Estrosi, mayor of the southern coastal city of Nice, said: \"Narcotrafficking has transformed into narcoterrorism. Its aim now is to terrorise, subjugate and rule.\"We have already successfully deployed the means to fight terrorism. It's time to act with determination against narcoterrorism.\"Estrosi was referring to wave of deadly jihadist attacks in the mid 2010s, when France deployed hundreds of soldiers on to the streets of many cities where they continue to patrol.",

Thank God. Continue mission!\"BBC Verify tracked the plane, and found that it began losing altitude off the south-west coast of Ireland. It then headed back east, having dropped to an altitude of 10,000 feet, accoring to FlightRadar24.At this time, the plane started broadcasting a \"7700 squawk code\" on its transponder. These are relayed to signify a general emergency onboard, ranging from engine failure to depressurisation to a medical emergency.In February a government plane carrying Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to turn back due to a crack in the window of the cockpit, as well.Defence ministers had gathered in Belgium on Wednesday to discuss security in Ukraine.

    "body": "1 day agoAna FaguyWatch: Surveillance video shows suspect setting Pennsylvania governor's mansion on fireThe man accused of setting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence on fire in April was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in state prison as part of a plea deal. Cody Balmer, 38, pleaded guilty to attempted murder, aggravated arson, 22 counts of arson, burglary and other offenses at a court hearing on Tuesday. While the official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg was severely damaged during the fire, people home at the time - including Shapiro, his wife, his four children, and guests and staff members - were able to escape unscathed.Shapiro said his family was supportive of the plea agreement announced by prosecutors.The attack against the governor and his family is part of a wave of political violence in the US, including attempted kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump, the killings of two Minnesota state officials and the killing of commentator Charlie Kirk. At a press conference on Tuesday, the Pennsylvania governor - standing alongside his wife - said his family has had to lean on their faith as they navigated a difficult recovery since the attack.“We will forever be changed by this, we know that time will heal, but the scars will remain,” Shapiro said.Balmer was accused of breaking into the govenor's residence and setting it on fire on the second day of Passover. The governor, who is Jewish, had hosted a Passover celebration the night before. Getty ImagesThe gutted interior of the governor's residenceBalmer had admitted to officials that he removed petrol from a lawn mower and poured it into beer bottles to make Molotov cocktails he used in the attack, Pennsylvania State Police said.He turned himself in 13 hours after the break-in and admitted to “harbouring hatred toward Governor Shapiro”, officials said. Balmer was asked in a police interview what he would have done if he had come face to face with Shapiro. He told police he would have beaten the governor with a hammer, according to an affidavit. Shapiro has served as Pennsylvania's governor since 2023, after working as the state's attorney general.The Democrat was among the top picks to be Kamala Harris's running mate during the 2024 presidential election, but was ultimately passed over. He has frequently been mentioned as a possible future presidential candidate.Getty Images",

    "body": "1 day agoIone WellsSouth America Correspondent andNadine YousifThe US has struck another vessel off the coast of Venezuela on Tuesday, killing six people, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the vessel belonged to \"narcoterrorists\" and that it was \"trafficking narcotics\". This is the fifth strike of its kind by the Trump administration on a boat accused of trafficking drugs on international waters since September. In total, 27 people have been reported killed, but the US has not provided evidence or details about identities of the vessels or those on board them.Some lawyers have accused the US of breaching international law, and neighbouring nations like Colombia and Venezuela have condemned the strikes.In his Truth Social post, Trump said \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known\" route for smuggling. He also posted an aerial surveillance video showing a small boat on water that is struck by a missile and explodes.US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': What do we know, and was it legal?What is Trump's goal as US bombs 'Venezuela drugs boat'?Trump did not specify the nationality of those on board, or what drug smuggling organisation they are suspected of belonging to. He added that no US military personnel were injured. The strike comes after a recent leaked memo sent to Congress, and reported on by US media, that said the administration determined the US was in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. It has also deployed multiple warships to the Caribbean. The US has positioned its strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels as self-defence. Many lawyers questioning the legality of such military action.Framing this as an active armed conflict is likely a way for Trump to justify using more extreme wartime powers – for example killing \"enemy fighters\" even if they have not posed a violent threat, or detaining people indefinitely.While it is true that some drug trafficking occurs in Venezuela, and some cartels operate in the region that some of these vessels allegedly have originated from, it is not considered a hotspot for drug trafficking compared to some other locations in the region.As a result, many believe this is part of a wider political campaign to put military pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.The strikes come after the US announced a $50m (£37m) reward for any information leading to the arrest of Maduro - whose election to lead the country has been widely rejected by the international community - on drug-trafficking charges.Venezuela's government has reacted to previous recent strikes with anger. Maduro denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking, while another official has questioned the veracity of footage posted by Trump.",

    "body": "Four Chinese officials have been dismissed over a fireworks display in the Himalayas last month by outdoor apparel brand Arc'teryx that drew heated criticism. Videos of brightly coloured fireworks that apparently resembled a \"rising dragon\" erupting over a lush Tibetan landscape had sparked environmental concerns and a boycott campaign.  Arc'teryx and the Chinese pyrotechnics artist Cai Guo-Qiang, who designed the show, later apologised.Authorities in Tibet's Shigatse city said in a statement on Wednesday that more officials had been investigated and given warnings. They added that Arc'teryx and Cai have to provide compensation and help \"restore the environment\". Authorities said the fireworks, which lasted for nearly a minute and affected around 30 hectares (74 acres) of grassland, have caused limited short-term damage but said further monitoring was needed to assess \"ecological risks\".\"The incident created fireworks remnants, plastic debris and other things that were not thoroughly cleaned,\" the statement added.\"The instantaneous bright light and loud noise produced by the fireworks caused short-term disturbance to wild animals.\"The four officials who have been sacked include Gyantse county's Communist Party secretary, public security chief and two senior members of county and city-level environmental agencies.The artist who orchestrated the display, Cai, is best-known for his role behind fireworks for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He has said he would work with authorities in Tibet to help with the area's recovery.Social media users, who said the stunt ran counter to Arc'teryx's conservation-focused image, had called for a boycott of the brand.Arc'teryx was founded in 1989 and has more than 150 shops worldwide. It is now owned by a Hong Kong-listed fitness equipment company Anta Sports.The firm claimed the display had been aimed to promote local mountain culture, but said in its apology that it was \"out of line with Arc'teryx's values\". It also said it had used biodegradable materials and would work with an external agency to assess the project's impact.",

    "body": "Two French nationals have been handed lengthy prison sentences by a court in Iran after being convicted of espionage, Iranian state media reports.The reports do not name the defendants but they are believed to be Cecile Kohler, 40, and her partner Jacques Paris, 72, the only French nationals being held in Iran. They were arrested in May 2022 during a tourist trip. The pair have been found guilty of spying on behalf of both France and Israel, the reports say.The announcement comes more than a month after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a deal to exchange French detainees for an Iranian woman held in France was nearly complete.Iran has previously said Kohler and Paris could be released as part of that agreement.Another French tourist, Olivier Grondeau, 34, was released by Iran earlier this year after being handed a five-year prison sentence for \"conspiracy against the Islamic republic\".Iran's judicial news agency Mizan said one of the defendants was sentenced to six years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiracy against national security and 20 years in exile for \"intelligence co-operation\" with Israel.The other was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying for France, five years for conspiring against national security and 20 years in exile for being complicit in intelligence co-operation with Israel.Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently. It is unclear what \"exile\" entails, though in other instances convicts have been sent to remote areas.Mizan reports that their pre-trial detention would be deducted from their sentences and that the verdict could be contested within 20 days.France has accused Iran of holding Kohler and Paris arbitrarily and keeping them in conditions akin to torture. Iran denies the claims.Human rights groups say tourists and dual nationals are often held for leverage in diplomatic negotiations, released only when Iran gets something in return.The release of British-Iranian nationals Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori in 2022, after years in detention, came after months of negotiation that saw the UK settle a debt of nearly £400m dating from the 1970s.Kohler and Paris were touted as exchangeable for Mahdieh Esfandiari, who has been held in France since February on charges of promoting terrorism on social media. Iran has repeatedly called her detention arbitrary.Iran is thought to currently hold around 20 Europeans in detention, according to news agency AFP.These include British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman, who were detained in January while travelling through Iran on a motorcycling world tour and later charged with espionage.Their family maintains they are innocent and are being held in \"horrific conditions\".Last week, 18-year-old French-German cyclist Lennart Monterlos was released after an Iranian court acquitted him of espionage charges.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentSyria's interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has held his first talks with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow since ousting Russia's ally Bashar al-Assad 10 months ago.Putin spoke of the \"special relationship\" between both countries.Sharaa suggested he would continue to allow Russia access to its military bases in Syria.He was also expected to ask for the extradition of Assad, who was granted asylum after fleeing to Moscow.For years they were enemies, on opposing sides of a bloody civil war.Putin used brutal military force to prop up Bashar al-Assad. And Sharaa's armed Islamist group led the rebel offensive that eventually forced Assad from power.But on Wednesday, the Russian and Syrian leaders sat down together for the first time, putting pragmatism ahead of past enmity.\"Over the past decades, our countries have built a special relationship,\" Putin said.He added that there were \"quite a few interesting and useful undertakings\" on the agenda of their talks, and that Russia stood ready to \"do everything to fulfil them\".Sharaa said he wanted Syria to re-establish its relations with all countries, but \"chiefly with Russia\".\"We are trying to restore and redefine in a new way the nature of these relations so there is independence for Syria, sovereign Syria, and also its territorial unity and integrity and its security stability.\"They were warm words from two men seeking a good working relationship.Russia wants continued access to its Tartous naval port and Hmeimim military airbase on Syria's Mediterranean coast.Sharaa suggested he would allow this, saying Syria would \"respect all agreements concluded throughout the great history\" of their bilateral relations.In turn, he wants help to consolidate his power in Syria, secure its borders and rescue a parlous economy with access to Russian energy and investment.Russian ministers said they were ready to deliver foodstuffs and medication to Syria, and to help repair damaged power and transport infrastructure.But amid the smiles, tensions remain.Syrian sources said Sharaa would ask for Assad to be extradited so the exiled leader could face trial for war crimes. It is thought unlikely Russia would agree.On Monday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia had granted asylum to Assad because he and his family had \"faced the risk of physical elimination\".",

His three albums won four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D’Angelo appeared to be performing naked.\"The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,\" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US media partner.Fellow musicians Beyoncé, Nile Rogers and Lauryn Hill were among those paying their respects.'Strength and sensitivity'Singer Beyoncé thanked D’Angelo for his music on her website. \"You were the pioneer of neo-soul, and that changed and transformed rhythm and blues forever,\" she wrote. \"We will never forget you.\"Writing about his first meeting with D'Angelo, guitarist and producer Rogers recalled having encouraged the late star - who was then on the way up - to put out his material as it was \"perfect\".\"About a year later I heard one of those songs on the radio. It was genius and it was exactly what he had played for me,\" wrote Rogers. \"I know... I still have the original cassette.\"Singer and rapper Hill, who worked with D'Angelo at the start of his career, shared a similarly lengthy and personal reflection, saying his \"beauty and talent were not of this world\".\"You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,\" she wrote.Fellow rappers Doja Cat and Missy Elliot also paid their respects, as well as singers Jill Scott and Jennifer Hudson.\"A true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come,\" Doja Cat wrote on X. \"Rest Peacefully D'Angelo,\" posted Elliot, who was becoming one of hip-hop's biggest around the same time as the soul singer's rise in the late 1990s.Scott posted: \"I never met D'Angelo but I love him, respect him, admire his gift.\"Hudson noted how \"we lost a true original today\". \"D'Angelo, your voice will live on forever. Rest well, King!!!\"Tyler the Creator said his \"musical DNA\" was shaped by D'Angelo - \"We are so lucky to have been alive to enjoy his art,\" he wrote.ReutersThe award-winning singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazzD’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the number 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot on the music scene.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano when he was just three years old.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.Getty ImagesD'Angelo's song Lady earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music sceneIt went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016.Among those paying tribute was hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie.\"Such a sad loss,\" he wrote on social media. \"We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.\"The Voodoo album which was released in 2000 topped the US charts and in its most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album.D'Angelo had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq.",

    "body": "Hamas returns remains of two more hostages but says more time needed to reach others4 hours agoBernd Debusmann JrWhite House Reporter andHelen SullivanBBC NewsHamas says it has handed over the bodies of two more Israeli hostages under the terms of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, but says it needs time and specialised equipment to recover the rest of the deceased from the ruins of Gaza.The group's armed wing said in a statement it was committed to the deal but had returned all the bodies of hostages it was able to reach.US President Donald Trump has said Israeli forces could resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas does not uphold the agreement.In a statement, the Israeli PM's office said Israel had received - through the Red Cross - coffins containing the bodies of hostages which were now awaiting official identification.\"The IDF urges the public to act with sensitivity and wait for official identification, which will first be communicated to the families of the deceased hostages,\" the statement said.Senior US advisors providing an update on the implementation of the 20-point peace plan said that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving the remains of remaining deceased hostages.The advisors argued that Hamas had acted in good faith by returning the live hostages and was working with various interlocutors to find and return the remains of hostages.If the two bodies returned on Wednesday night are confirmed to be hostages, that would mean 19 are still unaccounted for in Gaza. Hamas is required to return all 28 dead hostages as part of the first phase of the Gaza peace plan.But Hamas's armed wing said in a statement \"the remaining bodies require significant efforts and specialised equipment to search for and retrieve, and we are making a great effort to close this file\".Earlier, Israel said it would \"not compromise\" on hostage returns, saying \"the mission is not complete\".Israel's defence minister said he had instructed the IDF to prepare a \"comprehensive plan\" to defeat Hamas in Gaza in the event of a renewal of the war.After meeting senior generals on Wednesday, Israel Katz said the military must be prepared to act if Hamas refuses to implement the peace plan.The latest repatriations came after Israel said one of four bodies returned by Hamas on Tuesday was not one of the missing hostages. The other three deceased were identified as Tamir Nimrodi, 20, Eitan Levy, 53, and Uriel Baruch, 35, the Hostages Families Forum said.Hostage families confirm identities of three of four bodies handed over by Hamas'Worse than starting from scratch': how big is the task of rebuilding Gaza?Gaza experts work to identify bodies of 90 Palestinians returned by IsraelEarlier on Wednesday UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher urged Israel to immediately open all crossings into Gaza for humanitarian aid, as called for in the ceasefire plan.In a post on X, Fletcher said Hamas must \"make strenuous efforts to return all the bodies of the deceased hostages\".He added: \"As Israel has agreed, they must allow the massive surge of humanitarian aid - thousands of trucks a week - on which so many lives depend, and on which the world has insisted.\"He called for \"more crossings open and a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles\" and said \"withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip\".Trump's ceasefire plan, which both Israel and Hamas accepted, envisaged the handover of all 48 hostages would be completed by noon on Monday. Hamas returned all the 20 living hostages on Monday. But the US-brokered ceasefire agreement appears to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not have been able to find all hostage remains before the initial deadline on Monday.Under the agreement, Israel also agreed to hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians in return for every deceased Israeli hostage.Israel has returned the bodies of a further 45 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry confirmed on Wednesday, bringing the total number of bodies released by Israel to 90.Meanwhile in Gaza, residents report growing concern about the durability of the ceasefire - and food prices have surged as Palestinians stockpile food.Traders and suppliers in the enclave have been hoarding food items to create shortages and drive up profits, fearing that the war could resume, local residents told the BBC.\"Every time we start to feel safe, new threats appear, and we fear the war will start all over again,\" says mother-of-six Neven Al-Mughrabi, a displaced resident from Gaza who lives in Khan Younis.\"I lost my house in Gaza City, I decided to stay here with my family because I don't trust the ceasefire and we're sick of displacement.\"She added that a trader in Khan Younis's main market said demand for flour, oil and sugar had surged within hours. \"Despite the sudden rise of prices by about 30%, people are buying as if they don't trust the calm will last long, everyone is afraid aid will stop,\" Neven says.The US advisors also said the US was working with Israel to create \"safe spaces\" behind the yellow-line for people to flee if they feel under threat from Hamas.In the longer-term, the advisors said they did not see a future for Hamas to govern parts of Gaza.The current focus, according to the advisors, is on \"de-confliction\" that would allow aid to flow into Gaza and reconstruction to begin, with an international security force still in its early stages.",

    "body": "22 hours agoKoh EweChina CustomsCustoms officers recently seized a batch of maps bound for export, which they described as \"problematic\"Chinese customs officers in eastern Shandong province have seized 60,000 maps that \"mislabelled\" the self-governed island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. The maps, authorities said, also \"omitted important islands\" in the South China Sea, where Beijing's claims overlap with those of its neighbours, including the Philippines and Vietnam.The \"problematic\" maps, meant for export, cannot be sold because they \"endanger national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity\" of China, authorities said.Maps are a sensitive topic for China and its rivals for reefs, islands and outcrops in the South China Sea.China Customs said that the maps also did not contain the nine-dash line, which demarcates Beijing's claim over nearly the entire South China Sea.The line comprises nine dashes which extends hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan.The seized maps also did not mark the maritime boundary between China and Japan, authorities said.Authorities said the maps mislabelled \"Taiwan province\", without specifying what exactly the mislabelling was.China sees self-ruled Taiwan its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island. But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.Tensions in the South China Sea flare up occassionally - most recently over the weekend, when ships from China and the Philippines figured in another encounter.Manila accused a Chinese ship of deliberately ramming and firing its water cannon at a Philippine government vessel.But Beijing said the incident happened after the Philippine vessel ignored repeated warnings and \"dangerously approached\" the Chinese ship.The Philippines and Vietnam are also particularly sensitive to depictions of the South China Sea in maps.The Barbie movie from 2023 was banned in Vietnam and censored in the Philippines for showing a South China Sea map with the nine dash line.The statement from China Customs did not say where the seized maps were intended to be sold. China supplies much of the world's goods, from Christmas lights to stationery.The confiscation of \"problematic maps\" by Chinese customs officers is not uncommon - though the number of the maps seized in Shandong easily eclipses past seizures. Goods that fail inspection at the customs are destroyed.In March, customs officers at an airport in Qingdao seized a batch of 143 nautical charts that contained \"obvious errors\" in the national borders.In August, customs officers in Hebei province seized two \"problematic maps\" that, among other things, contained a \"misdrawing\" of the Tibetan border.",

    "body": "9 hours agoLaura Gozzi andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorGlobal Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesRussian missile and drone attacks have knocked out power in regions across UkraineEmergency power outages have been brought in across almost all of Ukraine after a intensive campaign of Russian air strikes on energy infrastructure.This will be the fourth consecutive winter of blackouts throughout Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The energy ministry said all but two regions were affected. Only the eastern Donetsk region at the forefront of the war is exempt, while the northern Chernihiv region is already facing hourly outages.As well as targeting the power network, Russia has increasingly targeted Ukraine's railways. Ukraine has meanwhile ramped up attacks on Russian oil refineries, in border regions and beyond.One oil depot in the Crimean peninsula - which Moscow illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014 - has been burning for three days following a second Ukrainian drone attack in a week.The Marine Oil Terminal in Feodosia is the largest in Crimea and an important logistical link for Russian troops operating in Ukraine.Telegram channel Supernova+Images of the fire at Feodosia were posted on Ukrainian Telegram channelsKyiv's armed forces general staff said on Wednesday that 16 fuel tanks were damaged and that a large-scale blaze was continuing to burn.The surge in drone attacks on oil refineries and pipelines has also led to fuel shortages and price rises in some parts of Russia - a development that Ukrainian leaders hope will hit Russia's war effort and help bring the Kremlin to the negotiating table.The strikes have reduced Russian fuel exports to their lowest level since the start of the war, according to figures from the International Energy Agency.Ukraine's energy ministry said emergency restrictions were being brought in \"because of the complicated situation\". Emergency work was taking place in all regions affected by Russian attack, grid operator Ukrenergo said, and it urged consumers who still had power to use it sparingly.Temperatures in parts of Ukraine were forecast to fall to 3C overnight into Thursday.The electricity company in Lviv in western Ukraine said that because the outages were under emergency conditions there was no possibility to warn consumers in advance.ReutersPower outages have increased in recent weeks because of Russia's campaign of air strikesRussia argues its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are aimed at its military, but millions of civilians have already been affected by outages in recent weeks. On one night alone last week, on 9-10 October, a combined missile and drone attack caused power cuts in nine regions, from Kharkiv and Sumy in the north to Odesa in the south.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of aiming to \"create chaos and apply psychological pressure on the population through strikes on energy facilities and railways\".Kyiv has long been pushing to be given more weapons that could allow it to strike deeper into Russia, and Zelensky this week vowed that long-range weapons would be used only on military targets, not civilians.Ukraine's Western allies have been wary of providing long-range weaons through concern such a move would escalate the war.Moscow has repeatedly said it would view the use of Western-made weapons to hit Russia as \"direct participation\" of Nato countries in the war in Ukraine.However, Moscow's \"red line\" on Western missiles has already been crossed without any clear consequences.US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly spoken of his impatience with Russia's failure to move towards ending the war, has said he is considering supplying Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles.He is due to meet Zelensky in the US on Friday.At a Nato summit on Wednesday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the US and its allies would \"impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression\" if the war in Ukraine did not come to an end.The US stood ready to do its part \"in ways that only the United States can do,\" Hegseth said, without elaborating further. He also encouraged Nato countries to contribute to the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (Purl) programme under which allies buy US-made weapons that are then sent on to Ukraine.Several countries have already said they would take part in Purl. Germany on Wednesday said it would spend $500m (£374m) on weaponry for Ukraine, while the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries have collectively pledged $1bn.Kyiv remains dependent on Western arms donations to push back Russian troops, although it has been developing its own defence industry.Research published by the Kiel Institute in Germany this week showed that military aid sent to Ukraine had declined by 43% compared with the first half of the year.",

    "body": "Foul skies, fading light: How air pollution is stealing India's sunshine2 days agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentHindustan Times via Getty ImagesIndia faces a severe air pollution crisis, ranking among the world's top 10 most polluted countriesIndia is losing sunlight.A new study by six Indian scientists finds that over the past three decades, sunshine hours - the time direct sunlight reaches the Earth's surface - have steadily declined across most of India, driven by clouds, aerosols and local weather.Data from 20 weather stations from 1988 to 2018 shows a persistent decline in sunshine hours nationwide, with only the northeast region seeing a mild seasonal reprieve, according to the paper published in Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed journal published by Nature Portfolio.Scientists from Banaras Hindu University, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and the India Meteorological Department report that the steepest annual declines occurred in the northern inland region - notably Amritsar and Kolkata - as well as along the Himalayan belt and the west coast, particularly Mumbai.All of nine India's geograpically diverse regions showed an overall annual decline in sunshine hours, though the rate of decrease varied across India. Monthly analysis revealed significant increases from October to May, followed by sharp drops from June to July in six of the nine regions.This seasonal pattern of sunshine intersects with a deeper, long-standing problem: India's severe air pollution crisis - it's now among the world's top 10 polluted countries - which scientists trace back to the 1990s. Rapid urbanisation, industrial growth and land-use changes drove up fossil fuel use, vehicle emissions and biomass burning, sending aerosols into the atmosphere and dimming the Sun's rays.  Getty ImagesMumbai's sunshine hours are gradually declining, the scientists foundIn winter, high air pollution from smog, temperature inversions and crop burning across the Indo-Gangetic plains produces light-scattering aerosols, which reduce sunshine hours.These aerosols - tiny solid or liquid particles from dust, vehicle exhaust, crop burning, and other sources - persist in the air long enough to affect sunlight, climate and health.During June-July, monsoon clouds blanket much of India, sharply reducing sunlight even though aerosol levels are lower than in winter.Scientists note that higher sunshine hours from October to May don't indicate cleaner air; rather, they reflect more cloud-free days. Hazy winter sunlight may scatter or diffuse, lowering intensity without entirely blocking sunshine, which instruments still record as sunshine hours.\"Our study found that shrinking sunshine hours are linked to clouds that linger longer without releasing rain, blocking more sunlight. These longer-lasting clouds form indirectly due to aerosols that alter weather and climate,\" says Manoj Kumar Srivastava, a professor of geophysics at the Banaras Hindu University, and one of the authors of the study.Aerosols have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the ground in India by about 13%, while clouds accounted for an additional 31-44% drop in surface solar radiation between 1993 and 2022, according to Sachchida Nand Tripathi, an atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur.These patterns raise concerns for agriculture, daily life and India's solar energy ambitions, while highlighting where solar panels could be most effective.Solar now makes up 47% of India's renewable energy capacity. The government says it's on track for 500GW of renewables by 2030, with more than 100GW of solar installed as of early 2025. But declining sunlight could cast a shadow on the country's solar ambitions.According to Prof Tripathi, air pollution compounds the problem. It reduces solar panel output by 12-41% depending on the type of photovoltaic system - the technology that converts sunlight into electricity - and costs an estimated $245-835m in lost power generation.LightRocket via Getty ImagesIndia's solar ambitions could be dimmed by declining sunlightStudies also show that cleaner air could boost India's annual solar energy production by 6-28 terawatt hours of electricity - enough to power millions of homes for a year.But the impact of pollution doesn't stop at solar energy. It also takes a heavy toll on agriculture, causing an estimated 36–50% loss in crop yields - mainly rice and wheat - in the country's most polluted regions, according to Prof Tripathi.India isn't alone in losing sunshine; across the world, rising air pollution and shifting weather patterns have dimmed the skies.A study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics observed that Europe likely experienced reduced sunlight reaching the ground because of air pollution between1970–2009. In Germany, sunshine hours decreased by approximately 11% from 1951 to 1980, attributed to industrial gas emissions and associated cloud formation.Research also showed that stricter clean-air laws in the 1990s led to a rebound in sunshine hours across Europe.China also experienced a significant decline in sunshine hours from the 1960s to the 2000s, primarily due to increased aerosol emissions from rapid industrialisation. Sunshine duration varied across Chinese cities, with some areas experiencing more significant declines due to factors such as air pollution.The good news: scientists say the Earth's surface has gradually been receiving more sunlight since the 1980s - a trend known as global brightening, following decades of dimming.New analysis of satellite data from 1984 to 2018 appears to confirm this, showing the effect is strongest over land and in the Northern Hemisphere, driven mainly by falling aerosols in the 1980s and 1990s and shifts in cloud patterns.The bad news: heavily polluted countries like India are missing out. If the Sun keeps hiding behind smog, India risks running on fumes instead of full power.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: US \"looking at land now\" - Trump confirms CIA authorisation in Venezuela after boat strikesUS President Donald Trump has confirmed a report he authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, provoking outrage from the South American nation's leaders.US forces have already conducted at least five strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean in recent weeks, killing 27 people. UN-appointed human rights experts have described the raids as \"extrajudicial executions\".Speaking at the White House, Trump said the US \"is looking at land\" as it considers further strikes on drug cartels in the region. Nicolas Maduro, whose legitimacy as Venezuela's president is internationally contested after disputed elections last year, appealed on TV for peace with the US.The increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack. According to the New York Times, Trump's authorisation would allow the CIA to carry out operations in Venezuela unilaterally or as part of any wider US military activity. It remains unknown whether the CIA is planning operations in Venezuela, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies, but the spy agency has a long history of activities in South America. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday alongside FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump was questioned about the New York Times report.\"Why did you authorise the CIA to go into Venezuela?\" a journalist asked.\"I authorised for two reasons really,\" Trump said in a highly unusual acknowledgement from a US commander-in-chief about an intelligence organisation whose activities are typically shrouded in secrecy. \"Number one, they [Venezuela] have emptied their prisons into the United States of America.\" He added: \"And the other thing are drugs. We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we're going to stop them by land also.\"Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade. The president would not be drawn on whether the CIA's goal was to topple Maduro, for whom the US has offered a $50m (£37m) bounty. \"Wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?\" he said. In the most recent US strike on Tuesday, six people were killed when a boat was targeted near Venezuela's coast.On Truth Social, Trump said that \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known\" drug-trafficking corridor. As has been the case in previous strikes, US officials have not specified what drug-trafficking organisation was allegedly operating the vessel, or the identities of those aboard. Maduro took to the airwaves on Wednesday night to warn against escalation.\"No to regime change, which reminds us so much of the endless, failed wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and so on,\" said the Socialist leader. \"No to CIA orchestrated coups d'état.\"He added: \"Listen to me, no war, yes peace, the people United States.\"Earlier in the day Maduro ordered military exercises in the Caracas suburb of Petare and in neighbouring Miranda state on Wednesday. In a message on Telegram, he said he was mobilising the military, police and civilian militia to defend the oil-rich country.Foreign Minister Yván Gil said on Telegram that Venezuela \"rejects the warmongering and extravagant statements of the president of the United States\".\"We view with extreme alarm the use of the CIA, as well as the military deployments announced in the Caribbean, which amount to a policy of aggression, threat, and harassment against Venezuela,\" he added.Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-power submarine and fighter jets to the Caribbean in what the White House says is an effort to crack down on drug smuggling.In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it had determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of an organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which it says includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking. Maduro has denied the claims. Mick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and Assistant Undersecretary of Defense, told the BBC: \"In order to conduct covert action, there needs to be a presidential finding for the CIA specially authorizing it, with specific actions identified.\"Mulroy added that such a finding would mark a \"substantial increase\" in efforts against drug trafficking organizations.\"Perhaps a real life 'Sicario',\" he said, referring to a 2015 film that depicts US operatives launching clandestine operations against drug cartels in Mexico.(With additional reporting from Ione Wells)",

    "body": "1 day agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, DelhiMuskan SharmaMuskan Sharma has dedicated her crown to her motherMuskan Sharma stood up to men who tried to bully her over her clothes - and went on to win hearts and a beauty pageant.The 23-year-old, who was crowned Miss Rishikesh 2025 last week in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, told the BBC that even though it was a small local pageant, \"it made me feel like Miss Universe\".Sharma's win has made headlines in India as it came after a viral video that showed her spiritedly arguing with a man who barged into their rehearsals just a day before the 4 October contest.Sharma, who \"wanted to be a model and participate in a pageant since I was in school\", said the intruders came in just as they broke for lunch. \"We were sitting around, chilling, having a laugh when they walked in,\" she said.The footage showed Raghavendra Bhatnagar, district head of a Hindu group called Rashtriya Hindu Shakti Sangathan, objecting to skirts and western dresses Sharma and other contestants were wearing.\"Modelling is over, go back home,\" Bhatnagar is heard telling them. \"This is against Uttarakhand's culture.\" Sharma refuses to back down. \"Why don't you shut the shops which sell them [Western clothes]?\"She then tells him that he should expend his energies on things that are worse than women's clothing - social evils such as drinking and smoking.\"There's a shop right outside that sells cigarettes and alcohol. Why don't you shut that down? First stop those things and I will stop wearing these clothes,\" she says.The man snaps at her saying \"don't tell me what to do\". Likewise, she retorts. \"If you have the right to choose, then so do we. Our opinion matters as much as yours,\" she says.As the argument continues, Sharma is joined by some of the other contestants and organisers and Bhatnagar and his group, who threatened to stop the show, are finally escorted out by the hotel manager.Muskan SharmaThe Miss Rishikesh contestants were heckled by men for their clothes during rehearsalsSharma says her reaction to Bhatnagar was \"spontaneous\". \"I could see my dreams shattering in front of me. The only question in my mind at the time was will the pageant go on? Will I be able to walk the ramp? Or will all my hard work go waste?\" she says. The next day, the event went on as planned and Sharma won the crown.\"For three seconds after I heard my name announced, I was shocked,\" she said.\"But then I was happy that I stood up for myself and that I won. It felt like a double victory. It was a small pageant in a small place but it made me feel like Miss Universe,\" she said.Sharma says heckling of women for their clothing is unheard of in Rishikesh, a city in the Himalayan foothills on the banks of Ganges river. It's known for its ashrams and meditation and yoga retreats and is considered a holy Hindu site that draws in large numbers of tourists and pilgrims.The city is also sought out by fans of Beatles because the Fab Four had spent weeks at an ashram there in 1968.\"You see tourists dressed in western clothing here all the time and no-one bats an eyelid,\" she adds.Globally, beauty pageants have been criticised for objectifying women and reinforcing gender stereotypes. But these contests have been hugely popular in India since 1994 - the year when Sushmita Sen won the Miss Universe crown and Aishwarya Rai brought home the Miss World trophy. Both went on to become top Bollywood actresses and have inspired generations of young women since then to follow in their path. Similar successes in later years of Priyanka Chopra, Diana Hayden and Lara Dutta have only reinforced the belief that beauty pageants can be a ticket to success, especially for young women in small-town India.Sharma says her parents have always been very supportive of her decision to participate in the pageant. In the viral video, she's even heard asking Bhatnagar: \"Who are you to comment on my clothing if my parents allow me to to wear them?\"Muskan SharmaThe pageant took place as plannedBut the backlash to Western clothing in India is not new where what women wear routinely becomes a subject of debates. In a deeply patriarchal society, many link western clothing, especially jeans, to the \"moral degradation\" of young people. Schools and colleges set dress codes for female students and sometimes village elders bar an entire community of girls from wearing jeans.The BBC has reported a number of cases where girls and women have been singled out and humiliated for their clothes.A few years ago, we wrote about a 19-year-old student in Assam who turned up in shorts to take an exam and was forced to wrap a curtain around her legs after the teacher objected. In one extreme case, a teenager was allegedly murdered by her relatives for wearing jeans. Namita Bhandare in her column in The Hindustan Times newspaper points out that there is no objection to the Mr Rishikesh contest where participants are barely dressed.The objection to Sharma and other contestants' clothing, she writes, is \"barely a fig-leaf\". \"The issue is not clothes. The issue is freedom and aspiration. How dare these young women be on a stage that could springboard them to a larger global platform? How dare they cross lines of honour and shame that a patriarchal society has imposed on them?\"Bhandare writes that in India where there are not enough women MPs or judges, the pushback by young women from a small town is remarkable.Sharma says it's her mother who taught her to stand up for what's right. \"The crown is as much my mother's as it's mine. Without her I wouldn't be the person I am today.\"Her story, she believes, will now encourage other women to stand up for themselves, for what is right. \"I'm saying that in the moment, I was scared and nervous too. But I also want to say that if you believe that you're right, then you can also fight.\"\"For me,\" she says, \"the crown was always secondary. The more important thing was to encourage women to stand up against injustice, to speak up for what's right,\"I ask her what's the next step for her.\"I will go for Miss Uttarakhand next year and then Miss India. After that, I'll see where life takes me.\"",

    "body": "24 hours agoLauren Turner andOsmond ChiaReutersThe US government has seized more than $14bn (£10.5bn) in bitcoin and charged the founder of a Cambodian business empire, the Prince Group, with allegedly masterminding a massive cryptocurrency scam, which involved forced labour camps.UK and Cambodian national Chen Zhi was charged on Tuesday in New York for allegedly engaging in a wire-fraud conspiracy and money laundering scheme.Mr Chen's businesses were also sanctioned by the US and the UK as part of a joint operation. The UK government says it has frozen assets owned by his network, including 19 properties in London - one of which is worth nearly £100m ($133m).The BBC has contacted the Prince Group for comment.US prosecutors said it was one the biggest financial takedowns in history and the largest ever seizure of bitcoin, with approximately 127,271 bitcoin being held by US government.Mr Chen, who remains at large, is accused of being the mastermind behind a \"sprawling cyber-fraud empire\" operating under his multi-national company, the Prince Group, said the US Department of Justice (DOJ).The Cambodia-based group's website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. But the DOJ alleges that it runs one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organisations.Unwitting victims were contacted online and convinced to transfer cryptocurrency based on false promises that the funds would be invested and generate profits, the DOJ said.Prosecutors alleged that the company, under Mr Chen's direction, built and operated at least ten scam compounds throughout Cambodia, according to court documents seen by the BBC.Mr Chen was accused of managing the compounds that were specially designed to reach as many victims as possible, said prosecutors.His accomplices allegedly procured millions of mobile phone numbers and set up \"phone farms\" to conduct call centre scams, according to the court documents, dated 8 October.Two of these facilities had 1,250 mobile phones that controlled around 76,000 social media accounts for scams, the documents said.Prosecutors said Prince Group documents included tips on building rapport with victims, advising workers not to use profile photos of women who were \"too beautiful\" so that the accounts would look more genuine.US District Court EDNYCourt documents contained images of \"phone farms\" allegedly used to conduct  scamsAssistant Attorney General for National Security John A Eisenberg described the Prince Group as a \"criminal enterprise built on human suffering\".It also trafficked workers, who were confined in prison-like compounds and forced to carry out scams online, targeting thousands of victims worldwide, he said.Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly used the criminal proceeds for luxury travel and entertainment, said the DOJ. They also made \"extravagant\" purchases like watches, private jets and rare artwork, including a Picasso painting purchased from a New York City auction house, the department said.If convicted, Mr Chen faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in jail.In Britain, Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly incorporated businesses in the British Virgin Islands and invested in UK property. His network's assets include a £100m office building on central London, a £12m mansion in North London and seventeen flats in the city, said the UK foreign office on Tuesday.Being sanctioned, as part of a joint operation with US authorities, means he is now locked out of the UK's financial system.The Prince Group has also been sanctioned in the US and labelled as a criminal organisation.They were \"ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money\", UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.Cooper said: \"Together with our US allies, we are taking decisive action to combat the growing transnational threat posed by this network - upholding human rights, protecting British nationals and keeping dirty money off our streets.\"The foreign office said Mr Chen and the Prince Group built casinos and compounds used as scam centres and laundered the proceeds.Four businesses linked to the alleged scams - The Prince Group, Jin Bei Group, Golden Fortune Resorts World and Byex Exchange -  have also been sanctioned, said the foreign office.Two scam centres allegedly run by Jin Bei Group and Golden Fortune Resorts were named earlier this year in an Amnesty International report on the use of forced labour and torture in Cambodian scam centres.People working in scam centres are often foreign nationals lured by the promise of a legitimate job, and then forced to carry out scams under threat of torture, the foreign office said.These scammers operate on an \"industrial scale\", including in the UK, using tricks like fake romantic relationships to lure victims into being scammed, said the foreign office.Fraud Minister Lord Hanson said: \"Fraudsters prey on the most vulnerable by stealing life savings, ruining trust, and devastating lives. We will not tolerate this.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentPresident Donald Trump has acknowledged that a $20bn (£15bn) US lifeline to help calm Argentina's currency crisis is an attempt to sway legislative elections this month in the South American nation.Welcoming Argentina's libertarian leader Javier Milei to the White House, Trump warned that the US would not \"waste our time\" with helping Argentina if Milei's party did not prevail.Milei praised Trump for his peacemaking efforts and said the US president's policies would lead to \"prosperity\".Argentina's financial turmoil comes ahead of national midterm elections on 26 October, seen as a test of voters' desire to continue backing Milei's cost-cutting, free-market reform agenda.As Trump sat across the table from his Argentine counterpart on Tuesday, he said the not-so-quiet bit out loud.\"The election is coming up very soon,\" he said. \"It's a very big election.\"Trump added: \"Victory [for Milei] is very important. Your poll numbers I hear are pretty good. I think they will be better after this.\"And, you know, our approvals are somewhat subject to who wins the election.\"A presidential election is not due in Argentina until 2027. But Trump said if \"a socialist wins\" then the US would feel \"a lot differently\" about supporting the South American nation.\"If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,\" Trump said.For his part, Milei blamed Argentina's economic woes on his political adversaries.\"This liquidity problem that Argentina has is a result of the political attacks we have suffered from our opponents,\" he told Trump.How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over TrumpTrump is bailing out Argentina. What happened to 'America first'?Trump's backing for his libertarian ally, who took office in December 2023, is no secret.He said the bailout was \"just helping a great philosophy take over a great country\", and the White House has framed it as supporting an important regional ally.But Trump's explicit linking of a recently announced $20bn currency swap between the US and Argentina to Milei's electoral prospects is notable for an American president who has previously railed against foreign interference in elections.In recent provincial elections in Buenos Aires, Milei's La Libertad Avanza coalition (Freedom Advances) performed worse than expected, spooking markets as they watch for any sign his economic programme's days might be numbered.His party has recently been rocked by several corruption scandals.If Milei's party loses seats, or fails to gain more, in this month's midterms – that could affect his government's ability to pass further reforms.Several key vetoes he has tried to make have already been overturned by Congress, where he doesn't have a majority.But will US support actually make a difference?Argentine stocks fell after Tuesday's news conference.This intervention, which was supposed to stabilise the economy in Argentina, now seemed to hinge on Milei securing more political support.And it seems the financial markets are unconvinced that Trump's endorsement will be enough to boost Milei's electoral chances.This currency swap was, economically speaking, supposed to be a bit of a lifeline for Argentina's currency – the peso, which has been losing value for years.As a means to control inflation, Milei had been stopping the peso from devaluing too drastically by keeping it propped up with the country's reserves.The problem with that is that it drained reserves ahead of $20bn of debt due next year.That led to fears, including among investors, that the country was heading for a financial crisis if it defaulted on its debts again.Some thought that to avert this Milei might have to let the currency devalue drastically – which would lead to a spike in prices as people's money would suddenly be worth less.Many economists told me they thought this would be \"political suicide\". So, perhaps the US intervention helps avoid that political disaster.But is this really going to cut through to ordinary voters? Opinion polls suggest that some Argentines are tiring of Milei's sharp austerity measures.His supporters hail them for bringing down inflation and cutting the deficit.But they've come at a social cost – with large cuts to pensions, education, health, infrastructure, and transport and utilities subsidies among other things.",

    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge4 days agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"Back in Columbia University, all those years ago, the student from Pakistan had asked me a question. \"Don't you find it interesting,\" he said, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based international order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "2 hours agoMaia DaviesMetropolitan PoliceMatvei Rumiantsev, 22, was convicted on Wednesday at Snaresbrook Crown CourtA Russian man has been found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after Donald Trump's son told UK police he had seen a woman being beaten up on a video call.Barron Trump, 19, contacted officers when he was in the US to say his friend had been attacked by Matvei Rumiantsev in London in January 2025, a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.Prosecutors said Rumiantsev, 22, had been jealous of the woman's friendship with Trump. Rumiantsev, who lived in Canary Wharf, east London, was also convicted of perverting the course of justice. He was found not guilty of one count of rape and intentional strangulation, and another of rape and assault alleged to have occurred in November 2024.The trial had heard that Trump called the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on 18 January last year and contacted UK police shortly afterwards.\"I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up,\" he said, according to a transcript of the call released by the Crown Prosecution Service.Asked by the operator how he knew the woman, Trump said: \"I don't think these details matter, she's getting beat up but OK fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters.\"The operator responded: \"Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions?\"A few months later, in May 2025, Trump told police in an email that what he saw had been \"very brief indeed but indeed prevalent\".The 19-year-old said his video call to the woman had been picked up by \"a shirtless man with darkish hair\".This view lasted \"maybe one second\" before the camera flipped to \"the victim getting hit while crying\", he told police, adding: \"This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds.\"Jurors heard that Rumiantsev and the woman had been drinking together on the evening of 17 January and into the next morning.The prosecution said he assaulted the woman on 18 January 2025, including hitting her in the face. Getty ImagesBarron Trump is the US president's fifth and youngest childJudge Mr Justice Bennathan KC had cautioned the jury not to rely on Trump's account as the main basis for a conviction, noting he had not given evidence under oath or been cross-examined.Prosecutor Serena Gates said Rumiantsev had been jealous of the woman's friendship with Trump, perhaps because of his \"public profile\".Asked during cross-examination whether he was jealous of men the victim might speak to, Rumiantsev said: \"What I was really unhappy about was that she was frankly leading him [Trump] on.\"Mr Justice Bennathan KC told Rumiantsev the trial was about whether he \"attacked her or not\".Rumiantsev responded: \"I am being portrayed as a jealous person who can lose his temper due to jealousy. I want to just make clear that her actions towards him was wrong and it was not fair.\"He added: \"I was jealous to some extent.\"The conviction for perverting the court of justice relates to a letter Rumiantsev wrote to the woman from prison after the 18 January attack, asking her to withdraw her allegations.",

    "body": "18 hours agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesA former French senator has been found guilty of spiking an MP's drink with ecstasy in order to sexually assault her.Joel Guerriau received a four-year prison sentence - 18 months of which are to be served behind bars.He was also ordered to pay Sandrine Josso €5,000 (£4,350) in damages for emotional distress. Guerriau, now 68, invited Josso, 50, to his Paris flat in November 2023. He later admitted serving her a drink spiked with MDMA, but maintained it was an accident and denied having any intention of assaulting her.Shortly after the verdict on Tuesday, Josso said the sentence was a \"huge relief\". Guerriau's lawyers said he would appeal. According to court documents quoted by French media, Josso said she had gone to Guerrieau's home three years ago to celebrate his re-election when she started feeling unwell after drinking from a champagne glass.\"I had gone to visit a friend and I discovered an aggressor,\" she said on Monday while giving evidence in the trial. \"He looked at me insistently, I'd never seen him that way. I didn't want to show him my weakness, because I was worried that if I told him I wasn't feeling well, he would've forced me to lie down.\"Josso recalled managing to leave the flat and, with the help of a colleague, went to hospital where a toxicology report confirmed her blood had three times the recreational dose of MDMA.Guerriau told the court he had been going through a period of depression, and had meant to take the drug himself the night before. He did not end up doing so and accidentally offered the glass containing MDMA to Josso the following evening, he said.\"I feel sorry for Sandrine,\" Guerriau told the court in Paris. \"I am disgusted with myself, with my recklessness and my stupidity.\"He added: \"We don't talk about the effects of these drugs enough... All I want is to speak out on the dangers of these products.\"Getty ImagesSandrine Josso remains an MP for the centre-right MoDem partyAsked about the several internet searches he made around ecstasy and the drug GHB, he said he had no recollection.\"I was on the train, thoughts and ideas just come to you,\" he told the court, adding government members needed to show an interest in \"all current events\".Guerriau, a centre-right senator from the Horizons party, was suspended when the charges against him came to light. He resigned as a senator last October.Josso, who is still an MP for the centre-right MoDem, has become a staunch campaigner against so-called chemical submission - drug-facilitated sexual assault.\"What I went through is still very painful,\" Josso said, speaking to French media ahead of the trial beginning. \"Psychological trauma feels like being frozen in time... I jump at the slightest thing. I've become very vulnerable.\"Josso has gone on to join an association against chemical submission, set up by Caroline Darian - the daughter of Dominique Pelicot, who in 2024 was found guilty of drugging his wife Gisele and inviting men to rape her in their home for over a decade.Josso was often in court during the Pelicot trial. This week, Darian and her brother David attended the proceedings in the Guerriau case.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHarry SekulichReutersTrump claims Iraq would have \"zero chance\" of succeeding under former PM Nouri MalikiA former Iraqi prime minister has denounced threats made by US President Donald Trump to end US support for Iraq if he were to return to power.Nouri Maliki, who has links to Iran, was selected at the weekend by the ruling coalition of Shia-led parties as its nominee for prime minister.The US president wrote on Truth Social that Maliki would be a \"very bad choice\", adding: \"Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos.\" Maliki, whose time in office between 2006 and 2014 was marked by sectarian violence, stepped down after the Islamic State (IS) group seized large parts of the country.In a post on X, Maliki rejected US interference in Iraq's internal affairs and said he considered the comments a \"violation\" of the country's sovereignty and its democratic order.After being endorsed on Saturday by a Shia Co-ordination Framework, Maliki would then normally be nominated by the president, who holds a largely ceremonial role.Iraq's parliament was set to elect a president on Tuesday but the vote was delayed after the presidential candidate could not be agreed on.Influential Shia groups in Baghdad have varying links to neighbouring Islamic Republic, which is ruled by a Shia cleric. Washington has voiced concerns about Iranian-linked groups deepening its influence in the region, including Iraq. Trump said the country would have \"zero\" chance of success without US support after vowing to \"no longer help\" the country if Maliki was elected. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed concern about Maliki's links to Iran during a call with incumbent Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani on Sunday, emphasising \"that a government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq's own interest first\".Trump has frequently bucked precedent by intervening in other countries' elections, backing fellow right-wing candidates in elections in Poland, Romania and Honduras, where the US-backed winner was inaugurated on Tuesday.Earlier this month, the American military seized then-Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in order for him to face trial in New York.Maliki was a divisive figure during his two terms as prime minister. He was Iraq's second prime minister after the US-led invasion in 2003, which led to the overthrow and eventual execution of Saddam Hussein, who had overseen a brutal repression of Shia Muslims and Kurds over three decades.His sectarian approach and alienation of Sunnis and Kurds were blamed by many for precipitating the IS crisis.In 2014, Iraqi security forces under his command collapsed as hundreds of IS fighters seized control of a large part of north-eastern Iraq, including the city of Mosul.Three months later, Maliki was replaced as prime minister after losing the support of key militia and political leaders form his own Shia community and many outside powers, including Iran.",

    "body": "60 minutes agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterReutersSir Keir is greeted by Chinese government officials as he lands in BeijingPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in China for a three-day visit - the first by a British prime minister in eight years.Sir Keir is seeking to strengthen trading and cultural ties between the two nations after years of acrimony.But he has faced criticism from opponents at home over the risk posed by China to the UK's national security and Xi Jinping's human rights record.The PM - who will meet President Xi on Thursday - said the trip will bring benefits to the UK and it was important to maintain a \"strategic and consistent relationship\" with the world's second largest economy.As he arrived at the airport in Beijing, Sir Keir was greeted by a delegation of Chinese government officials and presented with a bouquet of flowers. Union flags were seen flying in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.Addressing the 60 British business leaders accompanying him on the trip, the PM said: \"On this delegation, you're making history. You're part of the change that we're bringing about.\"We are resolute about being outward-looking, about taking opportunities, about building relationships...and always being absolutely focused on our national interest.\"For a UK prime minister, the politics of engaging with China is tricky.In addition to China's human rights record, there are concerns about the scale of its espionage activities in the UK, with the head of MI5 recently warning that Chinese state operatives presented a daily national security threat.Sir Keir declined to be drawn on what he would seek to raise with Chinese leaders.\"In the past, on all the trips I've done, I've always raised issues that need to be raised, but I don't want to get ahead of myself on the specifics until I've had the opportunity,\" he told reporters travelling with him.He added: \"Part of the reason for engaging with China is so that issues where we disagree can be discussed, and the issues where we agree can be progressed, and so that's the approach.\"ReutersThe union flag flies alongside the national flag of China in Tiananmen SquareSir Keir will be hoping his visit - the first by a UK prime minister since Theresa May in 2018 - will mend relations with China, while keeping US President Donald Trump on side.He has insisted the UK will not be forced to \"choose between\" China and the US, amid rising trade tensions between the two superpowers in recent years.The UK would maintain \"close ties\" with the US on business, security and defence, he said, but added that \"sticking your head in the sand and ignoring China... wouldn't be sensible\".Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she would not visit China \"at this time\" if she was prime minister. \"We should be talking more to those countries who are aligned with our interests, not the country that is doing everything it can to undermine our economy,\" she told reporters.\"I think that that is what the prime minister should be talking about and he needs to show strength, not approving a super-embassy which many people think is going to become a spy hub.\"She had earlier said she was \"worried about what he's [Starmer] going to be doing when he gets to China\".\"He's probably going to give away the Isle of Wight before he comes back. Let's have an actual foreign policy, one that is rooted in realism and focusing on Britain's national interest,\" she added.Sir Keir also faced criticism from the Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons, where deputy prime minister David Lammy stood in for him at his weekly question time session.Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Whilst the Chinese regime still holds British citizen Jimmy Lai captive in prison, and whilst the Chinese regime continues to hunt down pro-democracy protesters on the streets of Britain with bounties on their heads, the British prime minister has gone cap in hand to China to ask for a trade deal on the promise of a super-embassy from which the Chinese regime will continue to spy on us.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoKelly NgandHosu Lee,SeoulAFPKim Keon Hee was also ordered to return a diamond necklace and pay back 12.85 million wonThe wife of South Korea's ousted former president has been sentenced to 20 months in jail for accepting bribes from the controversial Unification Church.However, the court cleared 52-year-old Kim Keon Hee on charges of stock price manipulation and receiving free opinion polls from a political broker before the 2022 presidential election, which her husband Yoon Suk Yeol won.Yoon has already been sentenced to five years' in jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024.This marks the first time in South Korea's history that a former presidential couple are convicted at the same time.On Wednesday, Judge Woo In-sung at the Seoul Central District Court ruled that Kim had \"misused her position as a means of pursuing personal gain\".\"The higher [one's] position, the more consciously one must guard against such conduct... The defendant failed to reject solicitations and was preoccupied with self-adornment,\" the judge said.In a statement after the verdict, Kim said: \"I humbly accept the court's sterm admonition and will not take its weight lightly\". \"Once again, I sincerely apologise to everyone for the concern I have caused,\" she added. Kim had previously denied all charges.A special counsel team appointed to the case said Kim received 80m won ($56,000; £40,600) of gifts, which include a Graff diamond necklace and several Chanel handbags, from the Unification Church between April and July 2022, in exchange for business and political favours. The team had sought a 15-year jail term and a fine of 2bn won for all three charges heard on Wednesday - for which Kim was convicted of one - but the judge noted that Kim was not the one who demanded or solicited the bribes, and that she had \"no significant criminal record\". She was however ordered to pay back 12.85m won in cash and the court also ordered the confiscation of the diamond necklace.Kim has also been charged over her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit Unification Church followers to the conservative People Power Party that her husband was part of, and accepting gifts in exchange for government job appointments. The court has yet to hear those cases. The former first lady had denied all charges, saying they were \"deeply unjust\", although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she said she later returned without using.She made a public apology when she appeared for questioning last August. \"I am truly sorry that a nobody like me has caused concern to the people,\" she said.Investigations into Kim's dealings with the Unification Church had also led to the arrest of church leader Han Hak-ja. Apart from the criminal allegations, Kim has also been the subject of other controversies. Last year, Sookmyung Women's University annulled an art education degree she graduated with in 1999, after an ethics panel found she had plagiarised her master's thesis.Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi in Seoul",

    "body": "13 hours agoKelly NgGetty ImagesK-pop band BTS' comeback tour is likely to be one of the biggest tours of the yearThe scramble for tickets to K-pop band BTS' comeback tour, which comes after a four-year hiatus, has seen Mexico's president appealing to her South Korean counterpart to add more shows in her country.\"I wrote a letter to the [president] of Korea... I still haven't received the answer, but let's hope it's positive,\" Mexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum said on Monday.BTS will hold three shows in Mexico City in May, as part of its 79-date world tour after a four-year hiatus. Tickets were wiped out in less than 40 minutes, local media reported.Some fans have also accused Ticketmaster and resale platforms of dynamic pricing, prompting an investigation.While on Ticketmaster, the official sales channel, tickets were going for between 1,800 pesos and 17,800 pesos ($100 to $1,030; £76 to £750), resale platforms were offering them for between 11,300 to 92,100 pesos, according to Reuters. Mexico's consumer watchdog has sanctioned resale platforms StubHub and Viagogo for \"abusive and disloyal practices\" over the ticketing process.About a million young people were vying for 150,000 BTS concert tickets, Sheinbaum said on Monday.\"This group, BTS, is very popular among young Mexicans,\" she said.Spotify lists Mexico as K-pop's fifth-largest market worldwide, with streaming of the genre's songs growing more than 500% in the country in the last five years. Sheinbaum wrote to South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung after being told by local concert promoter Ocesa that the band's packed itinerary made adding shows unfeasible.Seoul's presidential office and foreign ministry have declined to comment on the matter, according to South Korean media.BTS has not released music as a group since June 2022, as they took a break to explore individual music careers and later underwent mandatory military service.The septet's globe-spanning comeback tour – likely to be one of the biggest tours of the year – will kick off with three nights in South Korea's Goyang Stadium on 9 April, before travelling across across Asia, Europe and America.According to Billboard, the group and their record label Hybe stand to make more than $1bn (£740m) from the tour, across concerts, merchandise, licensing, album sales and streaming revenue.",

    "body": "Malaysia football officials quit over foreign-born players scandal7 hours agoKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesFifa launched a probe into seven players on Malaysia's football team after their victory over Vietnam in an Asian Cup qualifierThe entire executive committee of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) have resigned amid a simmering scandal over foreign-born players in the national team.The mass resignations would \"ensure that any necessary reforms may be undertaken without distraction or perceived conflicts, and with a renewed basis of trust\", FAM said in a statement on Wednesday.For days there had been speculation that FAM leaders would step down to prevent a takeover by a FIFA-nominated committee, local media reported.The resignations were meant to \"safeguard the reputation and institutional interests of FAM\" and avoid consequences that \"could affect Malaysian football as a whole\", FAM said.It added that until a new committee is appointed, FAM's operations will be managed by a small team led by its secretary-general with help from the Asian Football Confederation.The seven foreign-born players have been been fined by Fifa, which also temporarily suspended them from playing football.But that suspension was lifted this week by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is set to deliver a verdict on the fates of embattled athletes.What is the scandal about?After Malaysia's 4-0 victory over Vietnam in an Asian Cup qualifier last June, Fifa launched an investigation into the eligibility of seven foreign-born players on the Malaysian national team.They are: Spanish-born Gabriel Felipe Arrocha, Facundo Tomas Garces and Jon Irazabal Iraurgui, Argentinian-born Rodrigo Julian Holgado and Imanol Javier Machuca, Netherlands-born Hector Alejandro Hevel Serrano and Brazilian-born Joao Vitor Brandao Figueiredo.Fifa's \"grandfather rule\" allows foreign-born football players to represent countries that their biological parents or grandparents were born in.The rule aims to prevent national teams from simply importing foreign players to boost performance.But according to Fifa, FAM had forged birth certificates to make it look like the players' grandparents were born in Malaysian cities like Penang and Malacca.Fifa investigators said the grandparents' original birth certificates showed they had been born in countries like Argentina and Spain - all corresponding with the players' birthplaces.This \"constitutes, pure and simple, a form of cheating\", the football governing body said at the time.The Fifa disciplinary committee fined the players and suspended them for 12 months. It also ordered FAM to pay 350,000 Swiss francs ($440,000; £330,000).FAM said the discrepancies arose from an \"administrative error\" and maintained the players were \"legitimate Malaysian citizens\".But FAM's appeal was rejected by Fifa, which overturned the results of three of Malaysia's football matches - against Singapore, Palestine and Cape Verde - into 3-0 defeats.FIFA also vowed to launch a formal investigation into FAM and inform authorities in five countries of forgery offences.What's next?After losing its appeal against Fifa's decision, FAM took the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an independent body in charge of sports-related disputes.On Monday, the CAS lifted the suspension on the seven players, allowing them to participate in football activities until it issues a verdict on their eligibility.That verdict is expected in late February, a FAM official told local media.This means for now, the players can return to the pitch at their respective football clubs.On Tuesday, Spanish football club Deportivo Alaves announced that Facundo Garces has rejoined the team's training sessions.Photos shared by Malaysian football club Johor Darul Ta'zim also showed another three players - Joao Figueiredo, Hector Hevel Jon Irazabal - back at training.South East Asian countries in search of sporting success have launched recruitment drives for naturalised football players. Indonesia, for one, has welcomed a wave of Dutch-born footballers from the Indonesian diaspora. Since 2018 Malaysia has granted citizenship to 23 foreigners to play for the national team, home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail told parliament last October.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJaroslav LukivUkraine's DSNS emergency service/Kharkiv regionAt least one carriage of the passenger train was burning after the Russian drone attack in north-eastern UkraineUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned as \"terrorism\" a Russian drone attack on a crowded passenger train that local officials say killed at least five people and injured several others.More than 200 people were on the train, officials said, when one of the carriages was hit by a drone and two other drones exploded nearby, in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday.Zelensky said 18 people were in the carriage at the time and there was no \"military justification\" in targeting civilians.Russia has not commented on the strike, but it has intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's energy and transport infrastructure during the harshest winter in years.Elsewhere in Ukraine, the southern port city of Odesa was hit by dozens of drones and officials said three people were killed and dozens more wounded. Energy officials said a local facility had suffered \"enormous damage\" overnight into Tuesday and Odesa city chief Serhii Lysak said attacks had continued for a second night into Wednesday.Meanwhile, in the Kyiv region, a couple were killed and their four-year-old child was hurt when a residential block of flats was hit in a district close to the capital, police said.Millions of people across Ukraine have been left without heating, electricity and water after the Russian assaults.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In a post on social media late on Tuesday, Zelensky wrote: \"In any country, a drone strike on a civilian train would be considered in exactly the same way - purely as terrorism.\"Pictures and footage released by Ukraine's emergency services show at least one badly destroyed carriage still burning after the attack.Kharkiv's regional prosecutor's office said the train was struck near the Yazykove village. The office said the train was heading from the western border town of Chop to Barvinkove in the Kharkiv region via the regional capital Kharkiv.This line runs further east to the Donetsk region, and is used by local residents and Ukrainian soldiers travelling to and from leave, as well as their wives and girlfriends travelling east to see them.EPA/ShutterstockSeveral floors of one residential building in Odesa collapsed after the Russian overnight strikeOfficials in Odesa said Russia had launched more than 50 drones on the port overnight into Tuesday.Three bodies were found in the rubble after several floors of one residential building collapsed after the strike, and a number of other buildings were damaged.Russia's daily aerial assaults continue even though Ukraine-Russia talks last week held the latest round of talks aimed at ending the war. The talks that also involved US negotiators took place in the United Arab Emirates, and were hailed by all sides as constructive. However, key territorial issues remain unresolved, and further meetings are expected this weekend.",

The youngest fell through first after trying to \"ice skate\" on the layer of ice on the water, Hangaman said, adding that the two older boys then jumped in after him.\"When I seen them, they were struggling, and I know their bodies were already in shock,\" she said. \"The water was freezing cold.\"AFPHangaman said she had warned the boys to stay away from the waterWhile trying to save them, she began to struggle and was rescued by a neighbour.\"I tried to fight for my kids' life, where I had to watch them struggle and drown and I couldn't help them,\" she said.The neighbour, a football coach at the school the boys attended, heard her screams and was able to pull her out of the water.\"He said he heard the screaming or the call for help and came running. My friend had a horse rope, and he pulled me out with it,\" Hangaman said.In a statement, the local sheriff's office said the two older boys were pulled out of the water first by emergency workers and a neighbour, and taken to a local hospital.The six-year-old was later recovered after \"an extensive search of the pond\", the office added.Handout/AFP(From left to right) Kaleb, Howard and EJ were full of personality, their mother saidAuthorities did not release the children's names, but family members identified them as Howard Doss, six, Kaleb Doss, eight, and EJ Doss, nine.Describing her sons, Hangaman said EJ dreamed of becoming a football star, Kaleb loved to dance and sing, and the youngest, Howard, \"liked making people laugh\".The boys' school said they were \"devastated by this unimaginable loss\" in a letter to families seen by CBS News and that counsellors would be available to meet students and staff.",

Ecuador, whose president is an ally of Trump, has filed an official complaint.The incident comes at a time of high tension in the US city, just days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot dead by border agents during protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.Ecuador's foreign ministry said in a statement that an agent of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) had \"tried to enter the premises of the consulate\" at 11:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday.According to the Convention, the authorities of the country where the consulate is located \"shall not enter\" the parts of the consulate used for work \"except with the consent of the head of the consular post\".Ecuador said that its officials had not consented to ICE entering the consulate. While the Vienna Convention goes on to say that consent may be assumed in certain cases, they are limited to incidents where \"prompt protective action\" is required, such as in the case of a fire or some other disaster.In a video shared by Ecuadorean media, which has not been independently verified by the BBC, a consular official can be seen rushing to the entrance door and telling an ICE agent \"this is the consulate, you're not allowed in here\".The agent tells the official that \"if you touch me, I will grab you\". The consular official then states again that \"you can not enter here, this is a consulate, this is a foreign government's office\", before closing the door. In its statement, Ecuador's foreign ministry said that it had \"immediately\" handed an official letter of protest to the US embassy in Quito.The protest letter constitutes a rare note of discord between Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and the Trump administration. Just over two months ago, the presidents agreed to strengthen their countries' commercial and economic relationship and Noboa has in the past thanked Trump for designating two Ecuadorean criminal gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organisations.The actions of immigration and border agents in Minneapolis - in particular the fatal shooting of Pretti on 24 January and that of Renee Good a few weeks earlier - have triggered protests in the city and beyond. There are currently 3,000 immigration agents and officers in the region. Securing the US's borders and implementing tougher enforcement of immigration rules has been one of Trump's top priorities. According to a 20 January statement by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, her department removed \"more than 675,000 illegal aliens\" from the US since Trump was sworn in to a second term a year ago.

    "body": "2 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosandKathryn ArmstrongHandout via ReutersThe fleet is headed by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (file image)Donald Trump has warned Iran that \"time is running out\" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the steady build-up of US military forces in the Gulf.The US president said a \"massive Armada\" was \"moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose\" towards Iran, referring to a large US naval force.In response, Iran's mission to the UN said Tehran \"stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests\", but if pushed, it wrote in all capitals, it would defend itself and \"respond like never before\".Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Trump's latest warning to Iran's leaders follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on demonstrations in the country earlier this month.\"Help is on the way,\" he told protesters, before later changing his tune - saying he had been told on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,220 people, including 5,858 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. HRANA says it is also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.However, Trump's warning on Wednesday appeared to focus more on Iran's nuclear programme. \"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS,\" he wrote on Truth Social. Trump added that this force was \"ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary\".Earlier on Wednesday, before Trump's comments, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said: \"Conducting diplomacy through military threat cannot be effective or useful.\" \"If they [the US] want negotiations to take shape, they must certainly set aside threats, excessive demands and raising illogical issues,\" he said in televised remarks, translated by the AFP news agency.Using open-source tools, BBC Verify has been able to track some of the US deployments to the area. A US defence official confirmed that a naval \"armada\" led by the USS Abraham Lincoln had also arrived in the Middle East.The last time the US took action against Iranian nuclear sites was June last year, when it targeted three uranium enrichment facilities in Iran: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.American officials then said the operation - codename \"Midnight Hammer\" - had significantly set back the prospect of Tehran building a nuclear weapon.However, Hassan Abedini, the deputy political director of Iran's state broadcaster, claimed that Iran \"didn't suffer a major blow because the materials had already been taken out\" from the facilities.",

    "body": "2 days agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerifying Iran footage as internet blackout continuesVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMalu CursinoEEASThe EU's foreign policy chief said Europe was \"no longer Washington's primary centre of gravity\"Europe must step up urgently to improve its defence and make Nato \"more European to maintain its strength\", because the US has shaken the transatlantic relationship to its foundation, the EU's foreign policy chief has warned.The US would continue to be Europe's partner and ally, Kaja Kallas told a defence conference, but no great power had ever \"outsourced its survival and survived\".Tensions with the US flared when President Donald Trump threatened to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.Kallas's remarks came after Nato leader Mark Rutte prompted a backlash when he said European lawmakers should \"keep on dreaming\" if they thought Europe could defend itself without the US.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot reacted to the secretary general's comments on Tuesday by saying: \"No, dear Mark Rutte. Europeans can and must take control of their security. Even the United States agrees. It's the European pillar of Nato.\"Washington's transition away from Europe \"has been ongoing for a while\", the EU foreign policy chief said, adding that it was structural, not temporary.The 23 nations that were members of both the EU and Nato had a special responsibility to \"sync our efforts, together with Nato\". Like Barrot, she highlighted the importance of showing how a \"distinct European pillar\" would add value.The recent US-European rift over Greenland has highlighted the \"tectonic shift\" in the relationship that Kallas referred to in her speech, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on some of his closest European allies after they opposed his plans to take over the Arctic island.Mark Rutte was credited last week with calming tensions between Trump and European leaders, when the US president dropped his threat during talks with the Nato chief on the fringes of Davos. Trump said he was exploring a potential deal on Greenland, although no details have yet emerged.Last year, under pressure from Trump, Nato member states promised to increase their overall spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, although part of that could go towards national infrastructure.Rutte told the European Parliament on Monday that if Europe really wanted to \"go it alone\" on defence it would have to spend 10% of economic output (GDP) and create its own nuclear capability. A move away from the US would, in Rutte's view, \"lose the ultimate guarantor of our freedom, which is the US nuclear umbrella\".Addressing the same conference in Brussels as Kaja Kallas, EU Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said on Wednesday that the US now expected Europeans to take responsibility for their defence as the Americans were going to \"diminish their presence on the continent\".Europe was \"a giant, but a sleeping giant\" that needed waking up. \"We must very rapidly build our independence. Independence in defence: without delays and without excuses,\" he added.Nato's primary purpose when it was founded in Washington in 1949 was to ensure the security and freedom of its members in the face of a hostile Soviet Union - a Russia-dominated Communist empire that collapsed in 1991.Russian President Vladimir Putin has long accused Nato of expanding eastwards, creating a security threat to Moscow, and he framed Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as a response to that.However, an increasingly belligerent Russian state has prompted two more members of the EU - Sweden and Finland - to join the Nato alliance since the full-scale invasion.The Kremlin has demanded that under a future peace deal Ukraine must be barred from joining Nato.Although it is part of Ukraine's constitution to join the European Union and Nato, the chances of Kyiv becoming a Nato member any time soon are considered remote.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKayla EpsteinTrump: We will 'de-escalate a little' in MinnesotaPresident Donald Trump has said his administration is \"going to de-escalate a little bit\" in Minnesota, after the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration officers there.\"Bottom line, it was terrible. Both of them were terrible,\" he said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.Earlier this month, Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer, followed by Alex Pretti, who was killed on Saturday after being stopped by border agents.Pretti's death reignited local protests and public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Trump's remarks are the latest sign his administration is taking a step back on its operations in Minnesota.Speaking to other reporters ahead of a rally in Iowa Tuesday night, Trump said he viewed the killing of Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a veterans' hospital, as \"a very unfortunate incident\".Asked by reporters about whether he agreed with characterisations of Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist,\" Trump said: \"I haven't heard that.\"  Trump then added: \"He shouldn't have been carrying a gun.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said shortly after the shooting that Pretti \"wasn't there to peacefully protest, he was there to perpetuate violence,\" and accused him of \"domestic terrorism\". The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also said the agents fired in self-defence, after Pretti resisted attempts to disarm him. Noem said Pretti was shot because he was \"brandishing\" a gun during a confrontation. Eyewitnesses and local officials, however, have challenged that account, saying he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.There is no sign of a gun in Pretti's hand, according to analysis of the available video by BBC Verify.Local authorities said the gun had been legally registered and that Pretti had been shot after the firearm was removed.A preliminary report drafted by Customs and Border Protection also appears to contradict the initial DHS account of events. It says two of its agents fired their weapons at Pretti.It does not mention that Pretti was reaching for his firearm, according to a copy of the report seen by the BBC's US partner, CBS News.On Monday, the DHS pulled the Minnesota mission's leader and figurehead, Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, from the state. The department said it was deploying the White House's border tsar, Tom Homan, to take over there.Homan posted on social media on Tuesday that he had met Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and local law enforcement officials.Pretti's death, coming two weeks after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, enraged local residents and sparked fresh calls from state and city officials for the Trump administration to withdraw its 3,000 immigration agents and officers from the region.In the interview with Fox News, Trump appeared to defend the Minnesota operation, saying \"we took thousands of hardened criminals\" out of the state, \"so they have good crime numbers.\"\"That's all working out, we have Tom Homan there now,\" he said, before adding the administration would \"de-escalate\".Stephen Miller, a top White House aide working on the administration's deportation initiative, told CNN that the White House \"provided clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors\".\"We are evaluating why the [US Customs and Border Patrol] team may not have been following that protocol,\" Miller said in his statement to CNN.Some Republican leaders and lawmakers have called for an investigation into Pretti's death, including Vermont Governor Phil Scott and US Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.\"The nation witnessed a horrifying situation this weekend,\" Ricketts wrote on X. While he reaffirmed his \"support for funding ICE remains the same,\" Ricketts said he expected \"a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident\".A federal judge has blocked DHS from destroying or altering evidence.In his speech at the Iowa rally on Tuesday night, which was dedicated to his economic policies, Trump did not discuss the current situation in Minnesota in depth, but talked about his immigration crackdown more broadly, citing a Harvard Harris poll from December that suggested 80% of Americans support his administration's efforts to deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "2 days agoSeher AsafGetty ImagesThe Bangalore-bound bus was carrying about 40 passengers when it collided with a motorcycle on Friday A bus fire that killed at least 20 people in southern India was intensified by hundreds of smartphones being onboard, local reports say, citing forensics officials.Flames rapidly engulfed the Bangalore-bound bus after it collided with a motorcycle that ruptured its fuel tank and triggered an explosion early on Friday.Eyewitnesses said the approximately 40 passengers had struggled to escape as locals rushed to pull out survivors.Forensic experts have now told local media that the bus had been carrying a shipment of 234 mobile phones, and that the lithium-ion batteries they contained likely exacerbated the fire once they ruptured.\"The bus batteries, presence of flammable furnishings in the bus and the cargo consisting of cell phones aggravated the fire leading to the tragic event,\" CNN News18 quotes Kurnool Superintendent of Police Vikrant Patel as saying. Meanwhile, P Venkataraman, the director-general of the Andhra Pradesh Fire Services Department, said electrical batteries used for the air conditioning system of the bus also exploded and made the fire worse. \"We saw bones and ash dropping through the melted sheets,\" he told local media.The smartphones were worth 4.6m Indian rupees (£39,361; $52,377) and were being sent from Hyderabad to an e-commerce company in Bengaluru, broadcaster NDTV reports.Most smartphones have lithium-ion batteries, which can pose a fire risk when damaged.This is because they can experience thermal runaway - uncontrollable temperature increases - which is hard to stop with conventional firefighting means. It can also spread to other batteries in close proximity.Authorities have opened an investigation into possible negligent driving over the crash. The bus driver fled the scene. The motorcyclist is said to be among the dead.Buses are a common mode of transport in India, but operators frequently ignore safety rules and overcrowd vehicles, while the nation had the highest road accident death tolls in the world last year.",

SSGAuthorities found two jars containing uranium in a car bootIt is unclear what isotope of uranium the men are alleged to have sought - though all can emit harmful radiation - and their intended purpose for it.As a former Soviet nation, Georgia had stores of nuclear materials following the bloc's collapse in 1991.The security of those materials has been an ongoing concern, with several serious incidents of uranium being illicitly sold in the years since.In July, the SSG arrested two people - one Georgian and one Turkish national - for attempting to trade $3m worth of uranium.",

    "body": "Ten people accused of sexist cyber-bullying of the French president's wife, Brigitte Macron, are due to go on trial this week in Paris.The defendants are accused of spreading unsubstantiated claims over her gender and sexuality, as well as making \"malicious remarks\" about the 24-year age gap between Brigitte and her husband, Emmanuel Macron.If found guilty, the defendants face up to two years' imprisonment.Among the ten people due to appear in the dock on Monday and Tuesday are an elected official, a gallery owner and a teacher, according to French media.Two of them - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander last year for claiming that France's first lady had never existed, and that her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name.But a court of appeals later acquitted Rey and Roy on the grounds that their statements did not constitute defamation. Mrs Macron and her brother are appealing the decision.A conspiracy theory centred around the notion that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has been swirling since her husband won a first term in office in 2017.The unsubstantiated claims over Mrs Macron's gender have been gaining ground in the US, mostly promoted by right-wing influencer Candace Owens.Last July the Macrons filed a lawsuit against Owens, alleging that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".Speaking to the BBC's Fame Under Fire podcast, the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, said that Brigitte Macron had found the claims \"incredibly upsetting\" and they were a \"distraction\" to the French president.\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.Emmanuel Macron has said pursuing legal action against Owens was about \"defending his honour\" and that the influencer had peddled false information \"with the aim of causing harm, in the service of an ideology and with established connections to far-right leaders.\"Mrs Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school. The couple ended up marrying in 2007, when Mr Macron was 29 and Mrs Macron was 54.",

    "body": "Argentina's Milei wins big in midterms with 'chainsaw' austerity7 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent in Buenos AiresAFP via Getty ImagesJavier Milei won nearly 41% of the vote in Argentina's midterm electionsArgentina's President Javier Milei has led his party to a landslide victory in Sunday's midterm elections, after defining the first two years of his presidency with radical spending cuts and free-market reforms.His party, La Libertad Avanza, won nearly 41% of the vote, taking 13 of 24 Senate seats and 64 of the 127 lower-house seats that were contested.His gains will make it easier for Milei to push ahead with his programme to slash state spending and deregulate the economy.President Donald Trump congratulated Milei on social media, saying: \"He's making us all look good.\" Before the vote, Trump made it clear a $40bn US lifeline for Argentina would depend on Milei keeping political momentum.Milei's supporters welcomed that, though critics accused Trump of foreign interference in Argentina's elections.In a nod to his North American ally, Milei told cheering supporters: \"We must consolidate the path of reform we have embarked upon to turn Argentina's history around once and for all… to make Argentina great again.\"Before these elections his party had just seven Senate seats and 37 seats in the lower house.That meant his programme of spending cuts and reforms faced various political obstacles.His vetoes of bills to boost funding for state universities, people with disabilities and children's healthcare were all overturned by opposition lawmakers.After Sunday's result, hundreds of his supporters gathered, cheering, outside a hotel in Buenos Aires where he was watching the result.\"Milei didn't have 15% of Congress in his favour. Now, with many more deputies and senators, he'll be able to change the country in a year,\" one young voter called Dionisio said.\"Our province was devastated by previous governments,\" another voter, Ezequiel, said.\"Now, thank God, freedom has won. We want our daughter to grow up in this beautiful country. What happened in previous years is regrettable.\"Getty ImagesHundreds of Milei's supporters gathered in the streets to celebrate the election resultThese elections were the first national test of President Milei's popularity since he took office in 2023, pledging to shrink state spending by taking a metaphorical \"chainsaw\" to it. He brandished a real one during his campaign rallies.He's since cut budgets for education, pensions, health, infrastructure, and subsidies, and laid off tens of thousands of public sector workers.Supporters, including Trump, hail him for taming inflation - which hit triple figures annually before he took office - cutting the deficit, and restoring investor confidence.His critics, though, argue the price has been job losses, a decline in manufacturing, crumbling public services, a fall in people's purchasing power and an imminent recession.Juliana, who works with children with disabilities in Tucumán province, is concerned that a law to increase funding for people with disabilities - which Milei vetoed, before being overturned - could be \"in danger\" with the president's position strengthened in Congress.\"Our salaries are low, it remains the same, while other things are increasing. We still don't see a change,\" she added.Veronica, a retired police officer, has been hit by Milei's pension cuts.\"You see a lot of poverty,\" she said. \"It's very hard: for retirees, for people with children with disabilities, for young people. There's a lot of unemployment. Many factories have closed.\"Juliana (L) and Veronica (R) are concerned about possible spending cuts Milei has also kept inflation down by propping up the peso, leaving it overvalued and draining reserves ahead of $20bn of debt repayments next year.This had caused alarm that Argentina could be hurtling towards an economic crisis.That, coupled with a poor election result in Buenos Aires province in September, spooked the financial markets that Milei's cost-cutting agenda may not be politically sustainable.These factors prompted the US to step in to help. It has now offered Argentina a potential $40bn lifeline via the combination of a currency swap, buying pesos and arranging private investment.\"If he wins, we're staying with him. If he doesn't win, we're gone,\" Trump had threatened.Before this election, doubts had grown about Milei's political future due to some voters tiring of his austerity programme, as well as a series of corruption scandals that had rocked his party.This election turnout was 67.9%, the lowest in a national election in decades, representing widespread apathy with politicians of all stripes.Some voters backed him reluctantly.\"Milei has two years left and should try to do what he can,\" said Dardo, a business owner in Buenos Aires. \"I think we're on the right path, but the middle and working classes are suffering too much.\"He is sceptical the support from the US will help, saying \"we're going to have to pay for it at some point\".Others, like political science student Thiago, said they understood the need for fiscal balance but questioned Milei's means.\"There's a lack of investment in hospitals, infrastructure, in people with disabilities,\" he said. \"There's a certain false hope.\"This election result, though, shows that many Argentines remain unwilling to return to the Peronist model Milei blames for decades of economic mismanagement. Getty ImagesMilei's took office in 2023 with a pledge to shrink state spending by taking a metaphorical \"chainsaw\" to it\"Argentines showed that they do not want to return to the failed model, the model of inflation… the model of a useless state,\" he declared.Financial markets are expected to rally after the win: a sign that, for now, Milei's political survival has also kept his economic experiment alive - and US support in place.His new mandate gives him the power to implement more radical changes ahead of the next presidential election in 2027, when his name could be on the ballot once more.The question now is whether ordinary voters start feeling better off, or if the pain of some of his cuts tests people's patience once more.For now, it appears a significant proportion of voters are – once again – prepared to give him time.",

    "body": "'No doubt' Trump wants to topple our government, Venezuelan official tells BBC14 hours agoTabby WilsonAFP via Getty ImagesTarek William SaabThere is \"no doubt\" that US president Donald Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government, the country's attorney general has told the BBC.Tarek William Saab, a close ally of President Nicolás Maduro, says Trump wants to turn Venezuela into a \"colony\" of the US.Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that a US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time Trump opponent from power.The US says it has killed at least 43 people in strikes on alleged drug boats off South America, and Trump has said the US is \"looking at land now\" after getting \"the sea very well under control\".When asked about the possibility of a land invasion of Venezuela, Saab told the BBC's Newshour programme that \"it shouldn't happen, but we are prepared\".He added that Venezuela was \"still ready to resume dialogue\" with the US, despite its \"illegitimate\" fight against drug trafficking.The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.But Saab said the US wanted regime change in Venezuela, accusing it of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.US Congress members on both sides of the political aisle have raised concerns over the legality of Trump's strikes on boats and his authority to order them.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Sunday that future land strikes were a \"real possibility\", and that Trump told him he plans to brief members of Congress on future military operations when he got back from Asia.Over the past two months, the US has been steadily building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking and \"narco-terrorists\".Many analysts believe this is also part of a wider intimidation campaign seeking to remove President Maduro from power.The Venezuelan leader has accused the US of \"fabricating war\" after it also ordered the deployment of the world's largest warship to the Caribbean, the USS Gerald R Ford, which is yet to arrive.On Sunday, guided-missile destroyer USS Gravely arrived in Trinidad and Tobago, a dual-island nation just off Venezuela's coast, as part of the US's largest military deployment to the Caribbean Sea in decades. It is officially visiting until Thursday to conduct joint training and exercises.Venezuela's government has since issued a statement condemning what it called \"a military provocation by Trinidad and Tobago in coordination with the CIA\".Venezuela also claimed that they had captured a \"mercenary group with direct information from the US intelligence agency\", and alleged that a \"false flag attack is underway\" in the waters between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago.A false flag operation is a political or military action carried out with the intention of blaming an opponent for it.Venezuela's President Maduro has made accusations of false flag attacks before, including a plan to plant explosives in the US embassy in Caracas in early October.Additional reporting by Ione Wells",

    "body": "2 hours agoLauren TurnerGetty ImagesLithuania will begin to shoot down balloons used to smuggle cigarettes from neighbouring Belarus, its prime minister has warned.The measure comes after balloons entering Lithuanian airspace forced Vilnius Airport to close multiple times over the past week, including at the weekend, with the government also closing Belarus border crossings temporarily each time.Border checkpoints will now be closed indefinitely in response to the helium weather balloons. Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene said \"we are ready to take even the most severe actions when our airspace is violated\".Announcing the actions at a press conference on Monday, Ruginiene said the army was taking \"all necessary measures\" to shoot down balloons.About the border closure, Ruginiene said diplomats will still be able to travel between the two countries, and EU citizens and Lithuanians can enter from Belarus, but no other movement will be allowed. \"In this way, we are sending a signal to Belarus and saying that no hybrid attack will be tolerated here, and we will take all the strictest measures to stop such attacks,\" she said.There has been no immediate response from Belarus.Lithuania plans to consult its allies over the threat posed from the balloons and may discuss activating Nato's Article 4 - a request for consultation by a Nato member country on any issue of concern, especially related to its security - she added.State Border Guard Service via APLithuanian airports were closed three times at the weekend due to weather balloons from Belarus, affecting 112 flights and more than 16,500 passengers, according to Baltic News Service. Earlier this month, 25 balloons entered Lithuania from Belarus, leading to 30 flight cancellations affecting 6,000 passengers, Lithuania's National Crisis Management Centre (NCMC) told the BBC.The phenomenon is not new: as of 6 October, 544 balloons were recorded entering Lithuania from Belarus this year, an NCMC spokesman said, while 966 were recorded last year. Other European airports - including in Copenhagen and Munich - have also been affected by air incursions, including drone sightings, in recent weeks. ",

    "body": "10 hours agoEthirajan Anbarasan,Global Affairs reporter and Koh EweDirect flights between India and China have resumed as relations between the countries appear to be thawing.IndiGo flight 6E 1703 from Kolkata landed in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Monday, carrying about 180 passengers.Flights between the two countries were first suspended during the Covid pandemic in early 2020 and did not restart after a deadly clash in a disputed Himalayan border area escalated tensions.But the two countries have been steadily rebuilding relations, and last year they reached a landmark agreement on border patrols.The Indian government had said the resumption of direct flights would \"facilitate people-to-people contact\" and help \"the gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges\" in a statement announcing the development earlier this month.It is part of a series of developments that indicate a gradual normalisation of ties between the neighbours.In August, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China for the first time in seven years, meeting President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Earlier that month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had visited India and discussed \"de-escalation, delimitation and boundary affairs\" with officials in Delhi.In July, India had also restarted issuing visas for Chinese tourists.According to travel data provider OAG, the two countries operated around 2,588 scheduled flights in 2019 before services were suspended.At the Kolkata airport on Sunday evening, airline staff lit brass oil lamps to mark  the resumption of direct flights as IndiGo passengers checked in.A senior Chinese consular official, Qin Yong, told reporters at the airport that it was a \"very important day for the India-China relationship\".Passengers expressed happiness that the time taken to reach China would now reduce. Krishna Goyal, who said he was travelling for business to China, told ANI news agency that direct flights would boost trade and relations between the countries.\"Earlier, we had to change two or three flights [to reach China]. We used to go to Singapore from Kolkata and from there to China,\" he said.China Eastern Airlines is set to launch a flight connecting Shanghai and Delhi next month. It will fly three times a week from 9 November, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in India posted on X.Additional reporting by Neyaz Farooquee in Delhi",

    "body": "54 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS President Donald Trump has not ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term for the White House, saying he would \"love to do it\". But Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice-president in 2028 - an idea floated by some supporters as a way for him to circumvent the US constitution that bars the president from running for a third term.Speaking to reporters during his trip to Asia, Trump described the idea as \"too cute\" and said it \"wouldn't be right\". It is unclear what method he would use to run again. Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon said that a \"plan\" was in place to secure the 79-year-old president another term. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Japan from Malaysia, Trump said that while he would \"be allowed\" to run again as vice-president, he had no plans to do so.\"I think people wouldn't like that,\" he said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\" Talking about the possibility of a third term, Trump said: \"I haven't really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.\" Additionally, Trump also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\".\"All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they don't,\" he added, referrring to Democrats.Can Trump serve a third term as US president?The 22nd amendment of the US constitution bars presidents from seeking a third term. Repealing the amendment would require approval from two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, or a constitutional convention called by  two-thirds of state legislatures - a process viewed as highly unlikely.Last week, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon - who remains a vocal supporter - claimed there was a \"plan\" to secure a third term for Trump.\"Trump is going to be president in '28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" Bannon told  The Economist. \"At the appropriate time, we'll lay put what the plan is.\" In March, Trump told CNBC he would \"probably not\" run again, though he later said  he was \"not joking\" about the possibility. It is still unclear which Democrats intend to run for the White House in 2028, although several have already expressed an interest. On Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that  he would \"be lying\" if he said he was not giving serious thought to a presidential bid. Former vice-president Kamala Harris also told the BBC she may run again and that she could \"possibly\" be president in the future. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoHugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent and Samantha GranvilleEPADowning an Israeli drone is a rare action by the UN's peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UnifilThe UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon says it shot down an Israeli drone that flew over a patrol operating in the south of the country on Sunday, in the latest incident involving the force and Israel's military.Unifil said the drone was flying in an \"aggressive manner\" near the border town of Kfar Kila and that peacekeepers applied \"necessary defensive countermeasures\".The Israeli military, however, said the drone was carrying out \"routine intelligence-gathering activity\".\"An initial inquiry suggests that Unifil forces stationed nearby deliberately fired at the drone and downed it. The drone's activity did not pose a threat to Unifil forces,\" spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani posted on X.He said Israeli forces later dropped a grenade towards the area where the drone fell.\"It should be emphasised that no fire was directed at Unifil forces. The incident is being further reviewed through military coordination channels,\" he added.Unifil said the grenade was dropped by another Israeli drone \"close\" to a patrol.\"Moments later, an Israeli tank fired a shot towards the peacekeepers. Fortunately, no injury or damage was caused to the Unifil peacekeepers and assets.\"Despite a ceasefire that came into force last November that ended the war with the Lebanese movement Hezbollah, Israel has continued to fly drones over Lebanon and carry out air strikes on people and targets in Lebanon it says are linked to the group.The military says it is acting to prevent Hezbollah from regrouping and rearming.The UN and the Lebanese government say Israel's actions are a violation of the country's sovereignty and in breach of the ceasefire deal.Downing an Israeli drone is a rare action by Unifil, which has been operating on Lebanon's southern border since 1978 and is set to begin a year-long withdrawal from the country at the end of 2026.The last known instance occurred in October 2024, when a German naval vessel participating in Unifil intercepted and neutralised a drone off Lebanon's coast during the war between Israel and Hezbollah.ReutersThe Israeli military has intensified its attacks in Lebanon recently, as Hezbollah insists it will not disarmThe latest flare-up comes amid ongoing tension along the Israel-Lebanon border despite a ceasefire reached last year.Under the agreement, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to move its fighters north of the Litani River and dismantle its military infrastructure there - a plan the group and its allies strongly oppose.Only the Lebanese army and Unifil are authorised to deploy armed personnel in the area south of the Litani, but Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites and has stepped up air strikes in recent weeks on what it said have been Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure, despite international and domestic pressure.Lebanon faces an intense week of diplomatic activity aimed at reviving the truce and consolidating state authority in the south.A new meeting of the US and French-led ceasefire monitoring mechanism - chaired by its recently appointed head, Gen Joseph Clearfield, and attended by US envoy Morgan Ortagus - is expected to take place alongside visits by Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad.US envoy Tom Barrack is also due to return to Beirut ahead of the arrival of incoming US Ambassador Michel Issa, who is set to take over the Lebanon portfolio next month.",

    "body": "An unnamed donor is giving $130m (£100m) to the Pentagon to help pay US troops during the government shutdown, sparking ethics concerns. US defence officials confirmed the gift, which President Donald Trump said will make up for shortfalls in paying the country's 1.32m service members, but declined to identify the donor.Trump provided a few clues, though, saying on Saturday that he was \"a big supporter of mine\" and a US citizen.The government shut down more than three weeks ago, after lawmakers failed to approve a funding deal. The Trump administration paid troops last week by shifting $8bn from military research, but it is unclear what will happen on the next payday at the end of the month.Now in its 26th day, the shutdown is poised to become one of the longest in US history.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday the US would probably be able to pay the military \"beginning in November\". \"But by November 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,\" he told Face the Nation, a talk show on CBS, the BBC's US news partner. \"What an embarrassment.\"The next military payday is scheduled for 31 October, at the end of this week.Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters on Friday that the donation \"was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits,\"  and it was allowed under the department's \"general gift acceptance authority\".Trump had indicated a donation would be made on Thursday, while also declining to identify the donor, saying \"he doesn't really want the recognition\".However, the New York Times has identified the benefactor as Timothy Mellon, a billionaire and major financial backer of Trump.Mr Mellon is the heir to his influential family's $15bn (£11bn) fortune, according to Forbes, and was heavily involved in the US railway industry before recently becoming more politically active and donating $50m to a group supporting Trump.Before leaving for Asia on Saturday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the donor was a \"great gentleman\", a \"patron\", a \"patriot\" and a \"wonderful man\" who \"doesn't want publicity\".\"He prefers that his name not be mentioned, which is pretty unusual in the world I come from,\" Trump said. \"In the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.\" \"He put up $130 million in order to make sure - that's a lot of money - in order to make sure that the military got paid, and he's a big supporter of mine,\" he continued.The funds amount to around $100 per servicemember. The White House was able to reallocate some military research funds to make the last military payday, while lawmakers in Congress have tried, and so far failed, to pass a bill that would keep troops being paid during the shutdown.Most government workers have been furloughed, or in some cases, told to work without pay while the shutdown lasts. According to Defence Department rules, donations over $10,000 must be reviewed by ethics officials \"to determine whether the donor is involved in any claims, procurement actions, litigation, or other particular matters involving the Department that must be considered prior to gift acceptance\".Donations from non-American citizens require additional scrutiny. While unusual, the Pentagon does sometimes accept gifts from donors, but they normally must be given to fund specific projects, such as a school, hospital, library, museum, or cemetery. Critics questioned why the US military would accept anonymous funds.  \"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" said Delaware Senator Chris Coons, the top Democrat on the Senate's defense appropriations subcommittee.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,Africa correspondent and Richard Kagoe,Africa editor, BBC World ServiceThe UN has called for safe passage for trapped civilians out of the Sudanese city of el-Fasher after paramilitary fighters announced they had seized control of the army's main base there. Sudan's military has not acknowledged loss of the site, which would be a significant victory for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the ongoing civil war. UN chief Antonio Guterres said the latest fighting marked a \"terrible escalation\" in the conflict, adding that the suffering of civilians was \"unbearable\", AFP news agency reports.El-Fasher is the last army foothold in the vast western region of Darfur, and has been besieged by the RSF and its allies for 18 months.Heavy fighting has been reported since Saturday after RSF fighters captured the home of the North Darfur governor.Social media videos verified by the BBC now show RSF combatants celebrating the capture of the army's el-Fasher headquarters.They claim to have seized full control of el-Fasher, but the army's local allies say fighting continues in parts of the city. Communication lines to el-Fasher have been almost completely cut off, while those who managed to flee are enduring harrowing hours filled with fear and uncertainty.\"We've witnessed many of our relatives being massacred - they were gathered in one place and all killed. Now we have no idea what has happened to those who are still alive,\" one man told the BBC. Another resident who fled said they were \"extremely worried, as we still have no information about what has happened to the people inside el-Fasher - the children, the elderly, the wounded\".Sudan's fertile region where food is rotting amid famine and warA simple guide to the war in SudanThe RSF has been accused of targeting civilians in airstrikes and trapping nearly 250,000 people after encircling the city with an earth wall, leaving many on the brink of starvation.The city is one of the worst battlegrounds of Sudan's civil war, leading the UN to  call it an \"epicentre of suffering\". The UN's top humanitarian official Tom Fletcher said he was deeply alarmed at the reports of civilian casualties. \"With fighters pushing further into the city and escape routes cut off, hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped and terrified - shelled, starving, and without access to food, healthcare, or safety,\" Fletcher said in a statement.\"Civilians must be allowed safe passage and be able to access aid,\" he added.The US has also called for safe passage and is trying to negotiate a ceasefire.Taking el-Fasher would be a crucial comeback for the RSF after defeat in Khartoum. But it is likely a sign that the civil war will continue, not end.Sudan has been ravaged by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued.More than 150,000 people have died across the country and about 12 million have fled their homes, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises.The army controls most of the north and the east, with el-Fasher being until now the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by government forces and its allies.The RSF controls almost all of Darfur and much of the neighbouring Kordofan region.The group has previously said that it hopes to form a rival government in al-Fasher when it assumes complete control.Additional reporting by Natasha Booty, Damian Zane, Danai Nesta Kupemba and Peter Mwai",

    "body": "Hurricane Melissa is forecast to become a rare category five storm as it turns towards Jamaica, bringing life-threatening flash flooding and landslides.The cyclone, which had winds of up to 120 mph (195 km/h) as of 06:00 GMT, is currently turning north-west in the Caribbean and is expected to make landfall by Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).It warns of power cuts and damage to infrastructure as Melissa brings up to 30 inches (76cm) of rain and sea level surges as high as 13ft (4m) above ground. \"Seek shelter now,\" residents have been told.Melissa is the 13th hurricane in this year's Atlantic season, which typically ends in November.A category five hurricane is the strongest type, with winds of at least 157mph. While Melissa is set to weaken to a category four before reaching Jamaica, the NHC said there was \"very little practical difference in the overall impacts\" upon landfall, and that the hurricane will be \"at least that intensity\" when it hits the island.With tropical storm-strength winds and rain already expected well before it passes over central Jamaica - including potentially the capital, Kingston - it warns that \"preparations should be rushed to completion\".\"A multi-day period of damaging winds and heavy rainfall have begun and will cause catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides,\" the meteorological agency urged residents. It also said the storm is moving slowly - at 5mph - which is causing more damage. \"This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,\" said NHC deputy director Jamie Rhome.Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said: \"I know that there are many Jamaicans who are anxious, who are very concerned, and rightfully so: you should be concerned.\"But the best way to address anxiety and any nervousness and concern is to be prepared.\"Residents are being told to secure their homes with sandbags and wooden boards, and to stock up on essentials.Warnings are also in effect parts of Haiti including the capital, Port au Prince, the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba, where Melissa is anticipated to bring similar effects by the middle of next week.Landslides already being caused by the hurricane have already killed two in Haiti, the nation's Civil Protection agency has said.Melissa is forecast to pass over Cuba by Wednesday before moving through the Antillas Mayores and out into the Atlantic.By the time it reaches Cuba, it is predicted to have weakened to a category three  storm.While it is hard to link individual weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making weather phenomena more common and more severe.Warmer oceans produce more moisture in the air, helping fuel the formation of hurricanes.Ahead of the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted above-normal activity, citing warmer seas and potential stronger monsoon activity around West Africa - where Atlantic storms often form.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he is adding 10% to US tariffs on goods imported from Canada, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan.Calling the advert a \"fraud\", the US president lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship.Prime Minister Mark Carney said in response that Canada was ready \"to continue to build on the progress we had been making\" in trade talks, but added that it was developing trade relationships with other countries. Canada is the only G7 country to not reach a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to levy steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Trump said while travelling to Asia on Saturday that he was \"increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now\". Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign products, not the exporters themselves.Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.Carney was asked about Trump's threatened increase at the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit that both leaders are attending, and said he was ready to continue discussions with one of the country's biggest trading partners.\"We have a consistent focus in those discussions on doing the best deal for Canadian workers and their families,\" he said.But he said the government could do more than one thing at a time, and it would in the next few weeks release an \"ambitious budget that makes generational investments in Canada\". At the same time, he said, the country was \"in the process of diversifying our trade relationships\", which included making deals with many Asean members.US-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc earlier emphasised that \"progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration\".Trump told reporters accompanying him on Air Force One that he had no intention of meeting his Canadian counterpart during the trip to Malaysia. His announcement comes after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause the anti-tariff advertising campaign \"so that trade talks can resume\", after the US cut off discussions over the advert featuring Reagan, a Republican president and conservative icon.But Ford said it would still appear through the weekend during games for the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.Trump responded that the advert should have been pulled down \"IMMEDIATELY\". A spokesperson for Ford stood by his statement on Friday.The advert, sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes Reagan as saying tariffs \"hurt every American\". It takes excerpts from his 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use the footage.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does, however, change the order in which he made the comments.Ford had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, told the BBC.The Reagan advert is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series in a social media video on Friday.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers - who are based in Newsom's state - win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"",

    "body": "The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France after a spectacular daylight heist exposed woeful flaws in the museum's security.On Friday a secret police escort oversaw the transfer of some of the remaining jewels to the Bank, 500m (about 500 yards ) from the museum, French media report.They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris. The vault is home to 90% of France's gold reserves, as well as the notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci and other national treasures. Its contents are worth an estimated €600m (£520m).The \"Souterraine\", as the vault is known, was designed to withstand all attacks, according to the bank's website.The main shaft is protected by a 50cm-thick, seven-tonne door made of flame-resistant concrete and reinforced with steel. Behind this door is a 35-tonne rotating concrete turret, which the bank says \"prevents any possibility of forced entry\".Last Sunday, masked thieves used an angle grinder to smash through a reinforced window into the Louvre's Gallery of Apollo, where France's crown jewels are kept.Within eight minutes, the gang seized treasures, including a necklace that belonged to Napoleon's wife Empress Marie-Louise and a diadem of Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugenie, worth €88m (£77m).The thieves used a mechanical ladder on the back of a lorry to lift them to a first-floor balcony to gain entry to the gallery.Interior Minister Laurent Nunez has said he has \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Although French ministers insist security at the museum had worked properly on the day, the Louvre director, Laurence des Cars, has spoken of weak and \"aging\" infrastructure.On Wednesday, des Cars told French lawmakers that the sole security camera monitoring the exterior wall where the break-in took place was facing the wrong way.",

    "body": "1 day agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondent, in Kuala LumpurWatch: Trump claims to have ended another war. Will it last?It was, as everyone knew it would be, all about US President Donald Trump.He literally towered over everyone else at the ceremony in Kuala Lumpur where Cambodia and Thailand signed their agreement. He gave the longest speech - and made the biggest claims.It was all superlatives. \"This is a momentous day for South East Asia,\" Trump said. \"A monumental step.\" Describing the two slightly sheepish-looking prime ministers who were about to sign the deal as \"historic figures\", Trump recalled at length how he got involved in the Thai-Cambodian border conflict while he was visiting his Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July.\"And I said this is much more important than a round of golf... I could have had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun... saving people and saving countries.\"Trump had asked for this special ceremony as a condition for coming to the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit - a gathering US presidents have attended at times in the past, but not always. And he used it to press his campaign to be recognised as a great peacemaker. \"The eight wars that my administration has ended in eight months – there's never been anything like that,\" he said. \"We're averaging one a month... It's like, I shouldn't say it's a hobby, because it's so much more serious, but something I'm good at and something I love to do.\"But what does the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord\", as Trump has renamed it, actually amount to?Remember, both countries signed a ceasefire back in July. That, too, was helped - or at least accelerated - by pressure from Trump. Looking at the details of the latest deal, though, it isn't much of a leap forward.The two countries have agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed border and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it. They have a new procedure for clearing landmines, and will set up what they call a joint taskforce to address the proliferation of scam centres. They will replace missing border markers with temporary ones.This is progress - and Thai diplomats have told me they do feel Trump's involvement may help these agreements stick. But the historic differences over the border remain unresolved and are at risk of flaring up again.After the ceremony, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow refused to call it a peace agreement - sticking instead to their own preferred title \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\", which doesn't exactly trip off the tongue.\"I would call it a pathway to peace,\" was as far as Sihasak was willing to go - a far cry from Trump's expansive claims for it.\"It's an extremely slight agreement for the president of the United States to be presiding over,\" posted Sebastian Strangio, author and South East Asia Editor for the Diplomat magazine.Cambodia has been a lot more enthusiastic, but then it has always sought to internationalise its dispute with Thailand - referring it to the International Court of Justice - something Thailand does not agree with. At the ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet gushed with praise for the US president - reminding him that his government had nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charvirakul was more circumspect - mindful of nationalist pressure back home not to be giving too much away to Cambodia, a problem the authoritarian government in Cambodia does not have to worry about. Thailand has always insisted the dispute should be resolved bilaterally, with no outside mediation. It says it appreciates Trump's support, and describes the US and Malaysia as only \"facilitating\" this agreement.Neither country - nor the rest of Asean - could afford to spurn Trump's request for this ceremony. South East Asia is the most export-dependant region in the world, far more reliant on the US market than China. It has had a difficult year living under the existential threat posed by Trump's initial tariffs - up to 48% - and going through the nail-biting negotiations to bring them down to a more manageable 19-20%. Trump is not even staying for most of the Asean summit. After a couple of bilateral meetings and a dinner, he's off to Japan, and then to an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting - another multilateral grouping at odds with his brutally transactional style, but where he hopes to reset relations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.But just having had the US president here in Kuala Lumpur for 24 hours will, Asean hopes, help restore some stability to their relationship.",

    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

    "body": "37 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorCentrist liberal leader Rob Jetten has claimed victory in Wednesday's nail-biting Dutch election, after vote analysis indicated his party could not be beaten by anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.Jetten's D66 party currently has a narrow lead of 15,000 votes over Wilders' Freedom Party, and Dutch news agency ANP says even though the vote count is not complete, Wilders can no longer win.\"We are the biggest party in the Netherlands! Now we'll get to work for all Dutch people,\" Jetten posted on X. Wilders said it was the electoral council not a news agency that decided the result: \"What arrogance not to wait for that.\"Projections from about 99% of the vote put both parties on 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament - but ANP says Jetten's centrists could win a 27th seat.Jetten, 38, told reporters he was \"very proud of this historic result\" and now felt a great responsibility to form a stable and ambitious government.Wilders had led opinion polls going into Wednesday's election, but Rob Jetten succeeded in winning in some of the main Dutch cities including Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht with a positive campaign using a catchphrase of \"Yes, we can\". No Dutch election race has ever been so close, and if Jetten does become prime minister he will be the youngest in Dutch history.Until now Jetten was careful not to declare victory until all votes were in, but ANP said based on figures from postal voters abroad he could now be declared the winner.Wilders said even if D66 did go on to become the biggest party, his Freedom Party (PVV) would \"not let the Netherlands be broken up by Jetten and his people\".Jetten told reporters that his party had \"shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message\".The Dutch electoral system is based on proportional representation in one nationwide constituency, so whichever party secures most votes wins most seats. Jetten's liberals have so far won 16.9% of the vote, while Wilders' Freedom Party is on 16.7%. As results came in on Thursday, the race was so close that the lead flipped between the two parties.Although the D66 leader's path to forming a coalition is not straightforward, Jetten has said he wants to make a quick start.Jetten said after the vote that never before had a party won a Dutch election with fewer than 30 seats. He will need the support of at least three other parties to gather the 76 seats needed to form a coalition. The most obvious candidates would be the conservative-liberal VVD, the left-wing Labour (PvdA)-GreenLeft alliance and the Christian Democrats, but it could take months if that is to happen.VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz has so far ruled out working with the left, but Jetten said he favoured a broad-based government from the centre of Dutch politics.The weekend would be a good chance for all the parties to reflect, before a \"scout\" is given the task next Tuesday of sounding them out. Jetten said he wanted to construct a coalition that represented best the millions of voters who had backed other parties to tackle the main issues, including the housing shortage and asylum and migration.His path to victory has stunned observers. Less than two years ago he led D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - to fifth place and just nine seats. Only a few weeks ago they were still languishing in the opinion polls, but gradually improved as Jetten put in several polished performances in TV debates and even  competed in the final of a TV quiz show 11 days before the election.Outgoing Prime Minister Dick Schoof predicted on Friday that Jetten's task of forming a coalition would prove complicated. \"I reckon I'll still be prime minister at Christmas - I'd be surprised if it happened [by then]\".Schoof, a former chief of Dutch intelligence, was picked for the top job by Geert Wilders, who abandoned his bid to lead the country last year because his prospective coalition partners would not support having a far-right prime minister.Wilders won the last election in November 2023, and a government was only formed in July 2024. Eleven months later, he brought his own government down, in a row with his coalition partners over asylum and migration policy.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorLatvian MPs have voted to withdraw from an international accord aimed at protecting women from violence, including domestic abuse, after a long and intense debate in parliament.Several thousand people protested against the vote this week in Riga. It is now up to President Edgars Rinkevics to decide whether to approve the law or not.Known as the Istanbul Convention, the 2011 treaty only came into force in Latvia last year, requiring governments to develop laws and support services to end all violence.Latvia is the first EU country to move towards pulling out of the treaty. Turkey withdrew in 2021, a move described as a huge setback by top human rights body  the Council of Europe.The treaty was ratified by the EU in 2023, however ultra-conservative groups have argued that the accord's focus on gender equality undermines family values and promotes \"gender ideology\".After a 13-hour debate in the Saeima, Latvian MPs voted by 56 to 32 to withdraw from the treaty, in a move sponsored by opposition parties but backed by politicians from one of the three coalition parties, the Union of Greens and Farmers.The result is a setback for centre-right Prime Minister Evika Silina, who joined protesters outside parliament earlier this week. \"We will not give up, we will fight so that violence does not win,\" she told them.One of the main political groups behind the withdrawal is Latvia First, whose leader Ainars Slesers has called on Latvians to choose between a \"natural family\" and a \"gender ideology with multiple sexes\".Latvia's ombudswoman Karina Palkova called for the treaty not to be politicised, and the group Equality Now said it was \"not a threat to Latvian values, it was a tool to realise them\".Thursday's vote has prompted an outcry both within Latvia and beyond. Twenty-two thousand people have signed a Latvian petition not to drop the treaty. Women's rights group Centrs Marta has called a protest next Thursday, accusing MPs of not listening to the Latvian people.The head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, Theodoros Rousopoulos, said Latvia had made a hasty decision fuelled by disinformation. It was, he said, an \"unprecedented and deeply worrying step backwards for women's rights and human rights in Europe\".Since Turkey abandoned the treaty four years ago, femicide and violence against women had risen sharply, he added.As the vote did not win a two-thirds majority, it means the president could return the bill for another reading, if he has objections. President Rinkevics said on X that he would assess the decision under the constitution, \"taking into account state and legal, rather than ideological or political, considerations\".Last week another member of the ruling coalition, the Progressives, said it would not rule out appealing to the Constitutional Court.Women are more likely to be victims of partner violence than men, according to the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), an EU agency.In its latest figures, EIGE said 142 incidents of intimate partner violence against women were reported across Latvia in 2022. This was above the 109 offences recorded in 2021 but below the totals in the previous three years and during the Covid pandemic.",

    "body": "The Sagrada Família has become the tallest church in the world, after workers placed the first part of a cross at the top of its central tower. Now measuring 162.91 metres tall, the Spanish basilica has officially pipped the record from the Ulm Minster in Germany, which has held the crown since 1890.Designed by acclaimed architect Antoni Gaudí, the place of worship has been under construction in the centre of Barcelona for more than a century, with the main building due to be completed next year. The central Tower of Jesus Christ will grow with the addition of the rest of the cross over the next few months, eventually standing at 172 metres tall. The first stone of the Sagrada Família was placed in 1882, with up-and-coming architect Gaudí taking over the project the following year. He transformed the original designs for the basilica into a far more ambitious proposal, which was initially funded by donations from repentant worshippers. At the time of his unexpected death in 1926, just one of the planned 18 towers had been built.In the years following, the construction of the architectural marvel was managed by the Sagrada Família foundation, and funded by contributions from tourists, visitors and private donors.In addition to the death of its primary architect, the basilica has hit a number of roadblocks throughout its almost 150-year construction. During the Spanish Civil War, Catalan anarchists set fire to the crypt, destroying plans and plaster models created by Gaudí that would guide future construction.Most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic saw construction on the building halted, with members of the foundation attributing the pause to a lack of tourism, and the subsequent drop in funding for the project.In September this year, Sagrada Família General Director Xavier Martínez told the Associated Press that the Tower of Jesus Christ would be completed in 2026, to coincide with the centenary of Gaudí's death.The foundation will hold a series of events to commemorate the architect, who is buried in the church's crypt.Work on decorative details, sculptures and a stairway leading to the building's main entrance is expected to continue over the next decade.",

    "body": "A Japanese superhero series that inspired the hugely popular Power Rangers TV and movie franchise from the 1990s is ending after 50 years, local media report.Super Sentai will go off air as sales from merchandise and events have not been enough to cover production costs, reports say. Its broadcaster TV Asahi declined to comment on \"future programming\", according to the Asahi newspaper.The series premiered in 1975 and its formula - five teens who transform into colourful masked fighters to battle aliens - served as the blueprint for Power Rangers in the US and many other superhero shows that aired in Asia.It also served as a launchpad for the careers of many Japanese actors.Super Sentai was much more than a TV series. The show that aired weekly was essentially an advertisement for toys, clothes, costumes and collectibles.For animation and toy fans outside Japan, it served as a gateway to the country's colourful superhero and comic book culture.Similar shows like Choudenshi Bioman and Hikari Sentai Maskman were dubbed in English and developed cult followings in the Philippines.In the Super Sentai series, the superhero team, made up of three men and two women, is led by a fighter in a red suit - as in Power Rangers. The rest of team is colour-coded, green or black for the second-in-command, followed by blue, yellow and pink.Every episode also followed the same sequence - starting with martial arts and swordfights and ending with a battle between their robot spaceship and a giant alien in the end. A large part of its appeal is the live-action animation, which in the 1980s and 1990s bordered on crude.The original Power Rangers series aired on US TV from 1993 to 1996 and there have been multiple spin-offs. The episodes are now streamed on YouTube.Producer Haim Saban, who adapted Power Rangers from the Japanese original, said in a 2017 interview with the LA Times that the concept was a tough sell at first.\"Every selling season, I would go out and offer it to the networks - and would get kicked out of the room... They told me how crazy I was,\" he said.News of Super Sentai's demise drew sadness from fans and celebrities.Popular actress Keiko Kitagawa re-posted a news article on the reported cancellation with the caption \"despair\". Her post on X was viewed 15 million times.Yasuhisa Furuhara, an actor who played one of the Super Sentai fighters, noted how the series ran for half a century. \"I'm proud to be a part of history,\" he said on X.One fan on X said his parents had watched Super Sentai when they were children. And that he is watching the current series. \"I'll miss it... What a shame.\"\"Super Sentai is coming to an end, so what should boys watch from now on?\" another fan said.",

    "body": "8 hours agoCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiIndia and the US have signed a framework agreement to expand defence cooperation over the next 10-years. The pact was announced after a meeting between US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement will enhance \"coordination, information sharing and tech cooperation\" and advance \"regional stability and deterrence\", Hegseth said on X. It comes as the two countries are trying to close a trade deal and tide over tense ties after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariffs on India, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms. The agreement is expected to provide policy direction to the entire spectrum of the India-US defence relationship. \"It is a signal of our growing strategic convergence and will herald a new decade of partnership. Defence will remain as a major pillar of our bilateral relations. Our partnership is critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region,\" Singh said, in a post on X. According to Pramit Pal Chaudhuri of the Eurasia Group think tank, the agreement was supposed to have been concluded in July-August this year, but India's irritation at Trump's statements about his role in ending the conflict with Pakistan led to it getting delayed. The pact is the latest in a series of agreements between the two countries that have made it \"easier for the two militaries to achieve interoperability, India to access technology and the two defence sectors to work together\", Mr Chaudhuri said. \"This provides for further potential in all three areas,\" he added. India and the US have been steadily ramping up their defence ties recently. Defence was a major talking point between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump on the former's visit to the US in February this year, withTrump saying the US would increase military equipment sales to India by many billions of dollars,  ultimately paving the way to providing Delhi with F-35 stealth warplanes.But since then, Delhi's dependence on discounted Russian oil as well as its long-standing defence relationship with Moscow have been a major point of irritation for the Trump administration. While Russia continues to be a major supplier of arms to India, its share of Indian defence imports has been steadily falling as Delhi seeks to diversify its portfolio and boost domestic capacity.In recent months India has hinted that it would be open to increasing energy and defence purchases from the US. The two countries are locked in high-stakes trade talks, aimed at reaching a long-awaited deal by November. With inputs from Soutik Biswas, India correspondent with the BBC.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel Hagan and Imogen Foulkes,Geneva CorrespondentEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe UN's human rights chief has condemned US military strikes on vessels allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific, saying the lethal attacks violate international law and amount to \"extrajudicial killing\".Volker Türk said on Friday that more than 60 people have reportedly been killed in US strikes since early September.Calling the attacks \"unacceptable\", he said Washington must halt them immediately and conduct prompt, independent and transparent investigations.President Donald Trump has said the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US and he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters.Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth has said strikes are being carried out on vessels operated by drug-trafficking groups designated as terrorist organisations by the US, saying this week that \"the Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans\".Türk, while acknowledging the challenges of tackling drug trafficking, said in a statement that the circumstances for the deadly strikes \"find no justification in international law\".\"Countering the serious issue of illicit trafficking of drugs across international borders is - as has long been agreed among States - a law-enforcement matter, governed by the careful limits on lethal force set out in international human rights law.\"Under law, the intentional use of lethal force \"is only permissible as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life\", he said.He added that based on \"very sparse information provided publicly by the US authorities, none of the individuals on the targeted boats appeared to pose an imminent threat to lives of others\".He called on the US to use law enforcement methods including intercepting boats and detaining suspects, and if necessary, prosecuting individuals.Watch: What we know about US strikes targeting alleged drug boatsMost strikes have taken place off the coast of South America in the Caribbean, though attacks in the Pacific this week killed at least 18 people, according to Hegseth.In the Caribbean, the US has deployed troops, aircraft and naval vessels and last week ordered the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - to the area.The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have also raised concerns and questioned the president's authority to order them.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government does not \"agree with these attacks\" and has called for meetings with the US ambassador, insisting that \"all international treaties be respected.\"BBC NewsThe US actions have also heightened tensions between Washington and the governments of Colombia and Venezuela.The US has placed sanctions on Colombian president Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to \"flourish\". Petro has responded that he has been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\".Trump has also accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies.Venezuela's attorney general told the BBC there is \"no doubt\" that Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government. He accused the US of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.

    "description": "On Wednesday, over tea and cakes with veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\"There is nothing",
    "body": "On Wednesday, over tea and cakes with veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\"There is nothing like this,\" the Russian leader said of the Poseidon - a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable underwater drone that can be fired like a torpedo and which a senior Russian MP said could \"put entire states out of operation\". When it was first unveiled in 2018, Russian media said the Poseidon would be able to achieve a speed of 200km/h (120mph) and travel in a \"constantly changing route\" that would make it impossible to intercept.Putin's claim came only days after the announcement that Moscow had conducted a test of its \"unlimited-range\" Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile. It's \"a unique product, unmatched in the world\", Putin said of the Burevestnik, noting the missile was so new \"we are yet to identify what it is, what class of weapons [it] belongs to\".It is not unusual for Russia to test and flaunt weapons.And, despite the boisterous nature of Russian announcements, their military value is ambiguous.\"They are basically Armageddon weapons - too powerful to be used unless you're happy to destroy the world,\" Mark Galeotti, a Russia scholar and long-time observer of Russian politics, told the BBC.Both the Poseidon and the Burevestnik are second-strike, retaliatory weapons, Mr Galeotti added - and not even the most rabid Kremlin propagandists are suggesting anyone is preparing to launch strikes on Russia. It is also unclear whether the weapons are actually viable. In 2019, five Russian nuclear engineers died in a rocket engine explosion which some Russian and Western experts said was linked to the Burevestnik.Two years later, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) - a London-based think tank specialising in global conflict and security - noted that Russia faced \"considerable technical challenges\" in ensuring \"the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit\" of the missile.Neither the Poseidon nor the Burevestnik were entirely novel - both had first been presented to the world in 2018 as part of a new array of weapons that Putin called \"invincible\".So it is the timing of the announcements - rather than their contents - which could be noteworthy. After a whirlwind few months of tentative diplomacy by US President Donald Trump to try and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Trump appears to have cooled off on the endeavour to end the war. Last week, the White House cancelled a summit between Trump and Putin, apparently after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio realised the gulf between Moscow and Washington's positions was too great for a high-level meeting to achieve meaningful results.Not only is there no suggestion of any further talks, but soon after the meeting was cancelled, Trump imposed sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil producers as punishment for Moscow's failure to agree on a peace deal in Ukraine.And while his relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seems to still be fraught, it appears Trump is growing irritated with Moscow's intractability.So Putin may be vying for Trump's attention. \"In the face of Trump blowing hot and cold with his support for Ukraine or sympathy to Russia, here is an element in which Moscow has bigger cards than Kyiv,\" Mr Galeotti argued. \"So in that context [successful weapons tests] are more about keeping him thinking Russia is indeed powerful.\"Another clue could come from the battlefield in Ukraine. Three-and-a-half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, its troops continue to merely grind on - at great cost in human life and resources - with no obvious breakthrough likely any time soon.\"We are getting towards the end of summer fighting season in Ukraine and it has not gone very well for the Russians,\" said David Heathcote, head of intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services.The announcements about the Burevestnik and the Poseidon should be seen as a reflection of the weakness of their conventional forces, Mr Heathcote told the BBC. Russia is not formally part of any military alliances that would serve as a deterrent if it is on the back foot, and its army is tied up and under pressure in Ukraine. In these cases, Mr Heathcote says, \"the Russians always react with unnecessary and overexaggerated sabre rattling\".While Moscow's decision to publicly announce the Burevestnik and Poseidon tests may have been influenced by this, it seems the claim has already had the tangible effect of provoking Trump into instructing its military to resume nuclear weapons testing.Trump justified the move as a way of keeping pace with other countries such as Russia and China. \"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said - although it will likely take several months for the US to restart nuclear tests after a 33-year pause.The Kremlin's reaction to Trump's statement was quickPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov questioned whether the US president had been correctly informed. The Russian tests \"cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test\", Peskov said. Trump did not elaborate on the kind of tests he wanted the US to resume.It was likely, said IISS Head of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control Dr Alexander Bollfrass, that Trump's decision was a direct response to the Russian test of the Burevestnik and that the US could be planning to conduct similar flight tests of US Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.

    "body": "9 hours agoPumza Fihlani,BBC Africa, Johannesburg and Wycliffe MuiaA South African court has ruled that Nobel laureate Albert Luthuli's 1967 death was the result of an \"assault\" by apartheid police, overturning decades of claims that it was an accident.An inquest held under the apartheid government concluded that Luthuli, the first African to win the Nobel Peace Prize, died after being struck by a freight train while walking along a railway line.But activists and his family had long cast doubt on the findings, and South Africa's government reopened the case this year. A judge on Thursday ruled that the anti-apartheid hero died as a result of a fractured skull and a cerebral haemorrhage associated with an assault. His family has welcomed the judgement.Luthuli, who at the time of his death was the leader of the then-banned African National Congress (ANC), won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960 for spearheading the fight against apartheid.Ghosts of apartheid haunt South Africa as compensation anger brewsSouth Africa's long wait for justice over apartheid crimesThe ANC went on to lead the struggle against white-minority rule and came to power in 1994, following the first democratic elections.South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority in April reopened fresh investigations into Luthuli's death as family and activists suspected the apartheid authorities had killed him and covered it up. Delivering the judgment on Thursday, Judge Nompumelelo Radebe said evidence presented at the reopened inquest did not support the 1967 inquest findings. \"It is found that the deceased died as a result of a fractured skull, cerebral haemorrhage and concussion of the brain associated with an assault,\" Judge Nompumelelo ruled.The judge said Luthuli's death was attributable to \"assault by members of the security special branch of the South African police, acting in concert and in common purpose with employees of the South African Railway Company\".She named seven men, whose whereabouts could \"not be ascertained\", as having committed or being complicit in the murder. If found, they could face criminal charges. After the judgment was read out, the Luthuli family's spokesperson called it \"the first part of finally getting justice\".ANC national spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu also welcomed the court's decision, which she said \"corrected a long-standing distortion of history\".\"This ruling brings justice, truth and dignity to the memory of one of South Africa's greatest sons and to all those who suffered under apartheid brutality,\" Bhengu added. The case at the Pietermaritzburg High Court is the latest in renewed efforts by South African authorities to deliver justice for victims of apartheid-era crimes and closure for their families.Last month, South Africa prosecutors reopened the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko, who died in police custody in 1977 after being tortured.In May, President Cyril Ramaphosa established a judicial commission of inquiry to look into allegations of improper influence in delaying or hindering the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDavid GrittenJerusalemReutersThe Israeli military said Sahar Baruch (L) and Amiram Cooper (R) were killed by their captorsIsrael has confirmed the identities of two deceased hostages whose bodies it received from Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza on Thursday.Forensic tests showed the remains were those of Amiram Cooper, 84, and Sahar Baruch, 25, the Israeli prime minister's office said.\"The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Cooper and [Baruch] families and all the families of the fallen hostages,\" it said in a statement.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel demanded that all 11 Israeli and foreign deceased hostages still in Gaza be returned immediately by Hamas in line with the US-brokered ceasefire agreement.Amiram Cooper was abducted along with his wife, Nurit, from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which sparked the war. Hamas released Nurit after 17 days, but it continued to hold Amiram.The Israeli military said it estimated Amiram was murdered in captivity in February 2024, but that final conclusions will be made upon completion of a post-mortem.It had previously said he was killed along with three other hostages - Nadav Popplewell, Chaim Peri and Yoram Metzger - in Khan Younis while troops were operating in the area. Hamas had claimed they were killed by an Israeli strike.Sahar Baruch was kidnapped during the attack on Kibbutz Be'eri by Hamas gunmen, who also killed his brother, Edan, and grandmother, Geula Bachar.The Israeli military said it estimated that he was murdered in captivity on 8 December 2023, and that it was awaiting the results of a post-mortem.It had previously announced that he was killed during a rescue attempt by Israeli forces.The military expressed its deep condolences to the two men's families and stressed that Hamas was \"required to fulfil its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to a dignified burial\".The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents many hostages' families, said: \"There are no words to express the depth of this pain.\"\"The hostages have no time. We must bring them all home, now!\"On Friday morning, Israeli authorities returned via the Red Cross the bodies of another 30 dead Palestinians in exchange for the two hostages, Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said.Under the ceasefire deal, Israel has agreed to hand over the remains of 15 Palestinians for every deceased Israeli hostage. Israeli prime minister's officeIsraeli soldiers salute the coffins, which were handed over by Hamas via the Red Cross in GazaOn Tuesday, the Israeli government accused Hamas of violating the Gaza ceasefire deal after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased Israeli and foreign hostages then still in Gaza.It said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage whose body had been recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023.The Israeli military also released footage filmed by a drone that showed Hamas members removing a body bag containing the remains from a building in Gaza City, reburying it, and then staging the discovery in front of Red Cross staff.The Red Cross said its staff were unaware that the body bag had been moved before their arrival and that the staged recovery was \"unacceptable\".Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".Hours later, the Israeli government accused Hamas of another ceasefire violation, saying the group's fighters had killed an Israeli soldier in an attack in an area of southern Gaza.Hamas claimed it was not involved in the incident in the Rafah area, but Israel's prime minister ordered a wave of air strikes across Gaza on Tuesday night in response. The Israeli military said it attacked \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\".Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 104 Palestinians were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, making it the deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.US President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire agreement, which his administration brokered along with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, but he added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.EPAOn Tuesday, Hamas fighters removed a body bag from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Khan YounisUnder the deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 225 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 15 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Nine of the 11 dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, in which more than 68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "Trump caps refugee admissions at record low - with most to be white South Africans14 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseThe Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.The move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.No reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was \"justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest\".In January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety. The previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.The notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years. The tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.The South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.Watch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turnOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".The US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups. Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in USIs there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Some have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East. \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\" \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added. Refugees International also slammed the move, saying it \"makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values\".\"Let us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status – they are not fleeing systematic persecution,\" Refugees International said in its statement.The South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement. During the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".Earlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. While the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. ",

    "body": "49 minutes agoWycliffe Muia and Lucy FlemingHundreds of people have been killed in Tanzania during three days of protests following Wednesday's general election, the country's main opposition party has said.A Chadema party spokesperson told the AFP news agency that \"around 700\" people had died in clashes with security forces. A nationwide internet shutdown is making it difficult to verify reports of deaths.The BBC has spoken to a diplomatic source in Tanzania who said there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died. Demonstrations have been taking place in major cities with young protesters denouncing the vote as unfair as key opposition figures were barred from running against President Samia Suluhu Hassan.A coronation not a contest - Tanzania's first female president faces little oppositionWhy elections are a time of fear for albino TanzaniansHow Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political angerProtests have continued on Friday in the main city Dar es Salaam - in the neighbourhoods of Salasala, Yombo and Tegeta - as demonstrators defied warnings from the country's army chief to end the unrest.\"Some people went to the streets on 29 October and committed criminal acts. These are criminals and the criminal acts should be stopped immediately,\" Gen Jacob John Mkunda said on state TV on Thursday, adding that the army had \"controlled the situation\".The government has sought to play down the scale of the violence - and the authorities have extended a curfew in a bid to quell the unrest.It has been difficult for journalists and human rights groups to check the reports of deaths because of the internet shutdown.Hospitals in the country have been refusing to give out information when asked about causalities.A source at one referral hospital in Dar es Salaam told the BBC it had been overwhelmed with casualties since Thursday.The source added that they had heard this was also the case at other public hospitals in the city where morgues were reportedly full.The UN has called on the East African nation's security forces to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force.\"We are alarmed by the deaths and injuries that have occurred in the ongoing election-related protests in Tanzania. Reports we have received indicate that at least 10 people were killed,\" Reuters quoted the UN human rights spokesperson Seif Magango as saying earlier on Friday.The BBC understands that ambassadors from several foreign embassies have also engaged the Tanzanian government to urge restraint from security forces in policing the protests.By late afternoon on Friday, the electoral commission had announced results from about 80 of the country's 272 regions, according to the state broadcaster TBC.The BBC understands that international observers have reported an incredibly low turnout during polling on Wednesday.President Samia is expected to win the vote under the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, which has governed the country since independence in 1961.Official results are expected on Saturday.On Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar - which elects its own government and leader - the CCM's Hussein Mwinyi, who is the incumbent president, won with nearly 80% of the vote.The opposition in Zanzibar said there had been \"massive fraud\", the AP news agency reported.Tourists on the island are also reported to be stranded at the airport, with flight delays because of the protests, which have been on the mainland, and the internet shutdown.A Kenyan music publicist said she was stranded for three days in Tanzania because of the communication problems.\"Internet, shops, petrol stations, email, social media, everything was down. Total disconnect. No international or regional calls in or out. No text messages in or out. There were no Ubers or Bolts available because there was no network,\" Anyiko Owoko posted on Instagram after making it home on Friday on a Kenya Airways flight.\"Many flights were cancelled, Tanzania's national airline was grounded. There were so many people stranded at the airport who couldn't book tickets or reschedule flights because of the connectivity blackout,\" she said.The protesters accuse the government of undermining democracy, as the main opposition leader, Tundu Lissu, is in jail and another opposition figure was disqualified from the election, bolstering Samia's chances of winning.Lissu is being held on treason charges, which he denies, and his party boycotted the vote.The only other serious contender, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party, was excluded on legal technicalities.Sixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, were cleared to contest the elections.Samia came to power in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death in office of President John Magufuli.She was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed, with her government accused of targeting critics through arrests and a wave of abductions.Additional reporting by Stewart Maclean and Basillioh Rukanga",

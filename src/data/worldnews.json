    "body": "Hamas ruled Gaza with an iron rod - will it really give up control?11 hours agoPaul AdamsDiplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem andRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondentBBCHow does a group that has governed the Gaza Strip for almost 20 years, ruling two million Palestinians with an iron rod and fighting Israel in repeated wars, suddenly lay down its arms and relinquish control?Judging by a steady stream of gruesome images emerging from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, Hamas seems intent on reasserting its authority.Its masked men, back on the streets, have been seen beating and executing opponents. Impromptu firing squads have dispatched kneeling men they say are members of rival groups, including some of Gaza's powerful clans.Other victims, cowering in terror, are shot in the legs or beaten with heavy clubs.Some of those now being attacked by Hamas had been part of groups involved in looting and diverting aid, according to one aid worker I spoke to, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The UN has also accused criminal gangs of stealing aid.This is not yet a world in which, as US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan envisages, Hamas fighters turn over their weapons, submit to an amnesty, leave Gaza and hand over to an international stabilisation force.AFP via Getty ImagesThe ceasefire came into effect on Friday 10 October​ - Hamas and Israel have both blamed each other for blatant violations of itFor his part, President Trump initially seemed ambivalent about the brutality.On his way to Israel on 13 October, he signalled the US had given Hamas - designated a terrorist group by the US, UK, Israel and others - a green light to restore order.\"We have given them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.Three days later, he hardened his tone. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"So, where does this situation on the ground in Gaza today leave Hamas? And ultimately, after two years of war that has resulted in unparalleled suffering for its own people and the violent death of most of its key figures, what, if anything, does the future really hold for the group?'A complete loss of law and order'For many Gazans, traumatised and exhausted by two years of perpetual suffering - and a war that has killed 68,000 people in Gaza according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry - this ugly endgame is nerve-wracking, but doesn't come as a surprise.Of the Gazans I spoke to - among them, aid workers, lawyers, as well as a former adviser to a Hamas leader - each has a different take on the likelihood of Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing control. And indeed - given the situation on the ground - whether now is the time for them to do so.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians gathered to celebrate following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement \"It's been two years with a complete loss of law and order,\" aid worker Hanya Aljamal says from her home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. \"We need someone to take over.\"As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs.\"Dr Ahmad Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, who was Hamas's political leader, is of the opinion that a firm grip is needed at present.\"As long as there are still people who try to take the law into their hands, we need somebody to scare them and squeeze them to the corner,\" says Dr Yousef, who now runs a Gaza think tank and remains close to the Hamas leadership.'As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs,' argues aid worker Hanya Aljamal \"This will take time. Not a long time. Within a month we will host those police forces and soldiers from Turkey and Egypt,\" he continues, referring to the international stabilisation force for Gaza, outlined in the peace plan, that could be composed of troops from Egypt and Turkey, among others. \"This is the moment where they will set their guns aside.\"Other Gazans are more sceptical, and fearful. Some aren't convinced that Hamas will give up their power - or weapons at all.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer imprisoned several times by Hamas, is one of them. AFP via Getty ImagesMany Palestinians and Israelis doubt Hamas is willing to step back from a political roleHe has been in hiding since July, when he says masked Hamas gunmen came to his Gaza City apartment and ordered him to report to al-Shifa hospital for interrogation.\"Hamas is [sending] a message to the world and to President Donald Trump… that they will neither relinquish power nor hand over their weapons.\"If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head,\" he says in one of a series of videos sent to us from an undisclosed location in the Gaza Strip. The wall behind him is riddled with bullet holes.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer: 'If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head'\"It is a gang, not a government,\" he says of Hamas. \"I don't want them to remain in Gaza… I don't want them in government, and I don't want them in security. I don't want to see their ideas spread in mosques, in the streets, or in schools.\"'Still the dominant player in Gaza'Mr al-Natour has his own take on what Gaza could look like.The disparate array of militias now under Hamas assault could, in his view, be integrated into a new security apparatus. But with their competing agendas, sometimes murky pasts and, in some cases, controversial links to the Israeli military, it's a problematic proposition.\"The fact is – and sometimes it's very hard for Israelis to admit this – that Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza.\" says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence.\"Relying on suspicious players - clans, militias, gangs, many of them criminals, many of them affiliated with ISIS [the Islamic State group], many of them involved in terror attacks against Israel - and considering them as a kind of alternative to Hamas is an illusion.\"'Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza' says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military IntelligenceHamas officials have said the group is willing to hand over political control of Gaza. The Trump ceasefire plan, to which it gave its qualified support, envisages \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\".But even if the group is willing to step back from a political role – something many Palestinians and Israelis still doubt - persuading its battle-hardened fighters to lay down their weapons is a big step for an organisation whose power, even before October 2023, relied heavily on the force of arms.Rise of Hamas and its iron gripTo begin to answer the complex question of what may happen to Hamas next requires delving backwards into how exactly it consolidated power in the first place.From its origins in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and a rival to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas morphed into a violent militant group responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians.Initially, Israel offered discreet support to Hamas, seeing it as a useful counterweight to the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah, led at the time by Yasser Arafat.\"The major enemy was Fatah,\" says Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, \"because they were the people who demanded a Palestinian state.\"But when Hamas launched deadly suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s and 2000s on Israelis, Israel responded with a series of high-profile assassinations.A violent power struggle with Fatah left Hamas, which won a 2006 election, in sole control of the Gaza Strip.Eighteen years of Hamas rule have followed, characterised by an Israeli military and economic blockade, and bouts of armed conflict in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021.Despite Israeli claims since October 2023 that \"Hamas is ISIS\", the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously convinced itself that Hamas did not pose a strategic threat.\"His was a policy of managing the conflict,\" says Mr Ayalon. \"He said we are not going to solve it and we are totally against the reality of two states, so the only way is to divide and control.\"With Hamas in control in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, ruling in part of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinians remained hopelessly divided, enabling Israel to argue that it had no unified leadership to negotiate peace with.\"[Netanyahu] did everything in order to support Hamas in Gaza,\" Mr Ayalon says. \"He let Qatar send them… more than $1.5bn.\"Getty ImagesIsrael has gone to enormous lengths to eliminate Hamas's key political and military figuresThe money from Qatar was meant to pay the wages of civil servants and support the poorest families, but security chiefs feared it was being used for other purposes.Mr Ayalon adds: \"It was clear to the director of the Shin Bet and the head of Mossad that this money would go to military infrastructure.Netanyahu has defended allowing payments to Hamas, saying it was meant to aid the civilian population.Hamas was always preparing for warAs 7 October brutally revealed, Hamas was always preparing for war. Nowhere was this more obvious than in its elaborate network of tunnels.Tunnels had already been used to mount attacks on Israeli army positions during the second Palestinian uprising, or \"Intifada\" that began in 2000.In 2006, Hamas fighters used a tunnel under the border with Israel to attack a military post near Kerem Shalom, killing two Israel soldiers and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. He was held for five years until his release, in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, who would go on to mastermind the Hamas attacks of October 2023.Getty ImagesYahya Sinwar, one of those behind the Hamas attacks of October 2023Over time, Hamas' tunnel network expanded, to include workshops, weapons-manufacturing sites and command centres.Regional developments also played a role. In 2012, after the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the brief rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas was able to smuggle increasingly sophisticated weapons into Gaza, including sniper rifles, mobile rocket launchers and equipment for the manufacture of long-range rockets.Hamas is thought to have benefitted from the help of technicians and fighters with experience of tunnelling in places like Lebanon and Iraq.Iran was also a key supporter, seeing Hamas as a natural component in its \"Axis of Resistance,\" a loose coalition of militant groups across the Middle East with a shared antipathy towards Israel and the United States.In 2020, a US State Department report said that Iran was providing around $100m a year to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesOver time, Hamas' tunnel network expandedSome tunnels were reportedly dug as deep as 230ft (70m) below ground, took years to build and cost tens of millions of dollars each. These were designed to protect senior Hamas commanders and house long-range weapons.A local expert with extensive knowledge of the tunnels told the BBC the cost of the entire project totalled roughly $6bn (£4.5bn).Precise figures are hard to come by, but it's thought that the scattered network extended for as much as 250 miles (400km), in a strip of land just 26 miles long and, at its widest, seven miles across.Tunnels: a project shrouded in secrecyPublic discussion of the tunnels - their location or cost - could expose Gazans to accusations of espionage, leading to arrest and worse. But many knew what was happening. Local residents would see the tell-tale signs: sand and clay being removed, new entrances appearing unexpectedly and machinery being brought in under cover of darkness.What began as an opportunistic response to Gaza's isolation became, over the span of three decades, a multi-layered subterranean industrial and military complex.It emerged later that much of it was concealed under Gaza's civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and, in the case of a tunnel containing a Hamas data centre, the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesAt least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since since October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministryAfter 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, it also became a massive underground prison. Not all of those held hostage were concealed in tunnels, but many were, especially as the war ground on.Eli Sharabi, who became one of the most high profile of those taken, was first moved from a safe house into a tunnel after 52 of his 491 days in captivity. \"They tied us with ropes in our legs and hands,\" he told the BBC earlier this month. \"I fainted from time to time from the pain. One time they broke my ribs.\"By the time he was released, in February, he had lost more than 30kg (4st 10lb).EPAEli Sharabi, who was held hostage, was moved from a safe house into a tunnel. 'They tied us with ropes,' he has saidHamas used the hostages as bargaining chips, to secure ceasefires or the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As negotiations over their fate continued, Hamas drip fed the Israeli public with a cruel series of videos, often showing the hostages in situations of extreme distress.Eventually it was, says Dr Yousef, internal and external pressure that forced Hamas to abandon the strategy.\"Qatar, Egypt and Turkey and also the people here in displacement camps sent a strong message to Hamas leaders outside that enough is enough.\"Getty ImagesIsrael assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024In the meantime, Israel continues to destroy what it can of the tunnel network, often demolishing civilian neighbourhoods above in the process.And the job is far from done.\"According to publications from the defence establishment, estimates speak of damage to between 25% and 40% of the tunnels,\" says Yehuda Kfir, an Israeli civil engineer and underground warfare researcher at Haifa's Technion University.\"No doubt [Hamas] aspires to rehabilitate the infrastructure, including restoring tunnels that were dealt with in various ways by the IDF.\"A leadership in tattersRestoring tunnels is one thing. Reconstituting the organisation is another. After the events of the past two years, Hamas' leadership is in tatters.Israel has gone to enormous lengths - in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon and Qatar - to eliminate the group's key political and military figures. From its best known, internationally recognisable leaders, travelling the world to promote their cause, to its battalion commanders on the ground in Gaza, Hamas has lost almost everyone of consequence.Israel assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024. Three months later, Haniyeh's successor, the elusive Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the ruins of a house in Rafah.ReutersIsmail Haniyeh (left) was assassinated in Tehran in July 2024, followed three months later by his successor Yahya Sinwar (centre). Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri (right) was killed in Beirut blastDespite the loss of these leading figures - and thousands of members of its armed wing - the group battled on, recruiting a fresh generation of radicalised young fighters and splintering into small cells intent on carrying out hit-and-run guerrilla-style operations.But Hamas in October 2025 is a pale shadow of the organisation that carried out the attacks of 7 October. Today's leaders are less well known and, crucially, have little political experience.Ezzedine al-Haddad, who is 55, now heads the five-member military council that commands Hamas' armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.EPA/ ShutterstockMany of the group's key political and military figures have been killed. (L-R) Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Sheikh Ahmed YassinOutside Gaza, the remnants of the group's political leadership include Khaled Meshaal (the subject of a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997), Khalil al-Hayya and Muhammad Darwish.All are believed to have escaped death on 9 September, when Israeli jets attacked a building in Doha, Qatar, where they were meeting to discuss the latest US ceasefire proposals.Hamas is 'tired of war'Despite the violence still raging in Gaza, the former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, says the group is tired of war. Without mentioning 7 October directly, he describes the cause of the war as a \"terrible mistake\" and that a \"different approach\" is needed.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPeople sit among the rubble and wreckage of war in Gaza. The former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, claims Hamas is also tired of war\"I'm talking to many of them and they have said that they are not interested in ruling Gaza anymore,\" he says. \"But Hamas has more than 100,000 members and those people are not going to disappear.\"Hamas, he suggests, is looking to rebrand itself in order to continue to play a political role in the future, a process he likens to the ANC's transition from guerrilla warfare to political rule in post-apartheid South Africa.\"If tomorrow there [are] elections,\" he says, \"I'm sure Hamas will come under different names, giving the impression it is more peaceful and more willing to be part of political life. \"Violence is not going to be part of any political party.\"Dr Milshtein is doubtful.\"Even if there will be a new local regime in Gaza, of course behind the scenes Hamas will be the dominant player,\" he argues.Anadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael may have to deal with Hamas for some time to comeDisarmament, he continues, is even less likely: he predicts another Gaza war within the next five years.But Ami Ayalon, the former Shin Bet chief, believes Israel should find another way to tackle its enemy.\"Unless we defeat the ideology, they will flourish,\" he says. \"The only way to defeat the ideology is by creating and presenting to the Palestinian and the Israeli people a new horizon. A horizon of two states.\"For now, that horizon does not exist, perhaps making Dr Milshtein's prediction more likely than Ami Ayalon's vision of a shared future.But Hamas, however diminished, is far from a spent force. One way or another, Israel may have to deal with it for some time to come.Top picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "23 hours agoFan WangCostfoto/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA Su-35 fighter jet - the model Australia says was used by the PLA in Sunday's encounter - seen at the 2024 Zhuhai Air Show in ChinaAustralia has accused a Chinese military aircraft of releasing flares \"in close proximity\" to its patrol jet over the South China Sea.The Australian government has raised its concern with Beijing over the \"unsafe and unprofessional\" manoeuvre, the defence department said in a statement on Monday.There was no damage to Australia's P-8A aircraft and its personnel were unharmed after Sunday's encounter.A Chinese military spokesperson said the Australian jet \"illegally intruded\" into China's airspace and had to be expelled. The Australian aircraft's actions \"seriously infringed upon China's sovereignty\", Senior Colonel Li Jianjian, spokesperson for China's Southern Theater Command Air Force said, urging Canberra to \"immediately cease its infringing and provocative actions\".Australia Defence Force said it expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a safe and professional manner.This is the latest in a string of encounters between the two countries' militaries in the region, where China's vast claims over islands and outcrops overlap with those of its neighbours.Sunday's incident also occurred as Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was heading to the US for a meeting with President Donald Trump, where the two leaders are expected to discuss the Aukus - a multi-billion dollar submarine deal between Australia, the US and the UK. Australia has also accused a Chinese jet of dropping flares near an Australian plane in the area in February. China at that time said the Australian jet had intentionally intruded into its airspace and that its response was \"lawful and restrained\".While it has no claims to the South China Sea, Australia has aligned itself close to the US and its allies in saying that China's assertions have no legal basis.In May last year, Australia accused a Chinese fighter plane of dropping flares close to an Australian navy helicopter that was part of a UN Security Council mission on the Yellow Sea off the Korean coastline.In November 2023, Canberra accused Beijing's navy of using sonar pulses in international waters off Japan, which resulted in injuries to Australian divers.",

    "body": "Former National Football League (NFL) running back Doug Martin has died aged 36 while in police custody in California. The Oakland Police Department said the former American football star - who spent most of his career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers - died after being involved in an alleged home break-in and a struggle with officers on Saturday. \"While attempting to detain the individual, a brief struggle ensued,\" the department said, adding Martin became unresponsive and was taken to a hospital, where he later died. His family announced his passing and said his cause of death was \"unconfirmed\". \"It is with great sadness to inform you all that Doug Martin passed away Saturday morning,\" his family told US media. The family asked for \"privacy at this time\". In a statement, Martin's former team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said they were \"deeply saddened to learn of the sudden and unexpected passing of Doug Martin\". \"From his record-setting rookie season in 2012 to his multiple Pro Bowl selections during his six seasons as a Buccaneer, Doug made a lasting impact on our franchise,\" the team added. Born in Oakland, California, Martin was Tampa Bay's first-round pick in the 2012 NFL draft. During his first season, Martin rushed for 1,454 yards and scored 11 touchdowns. Martin spent six of his seven NFL seasons playing for the Buccaneers, and was nicknamed the \"Muscle Hamster\" because of his high strength despite being relatively short for a professional player at 5ft 9in (1.75m) tall. But he struggled with injuries and was also suspended in 2016 for four games for violating the NFL's drug policy, after testing positive for a banned substance. He apologised and went to a drug treatment facility. Martin spent his final season with the Oakland Raiders, who are now based in Las Vegas, in 2018. ",

    "body": "13 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, in Sao PauloBrazil's state oil firm has received a licence to conduct exploratory oil drilling in the sea off the Amazon, despite environmental concerns about the project.The approval will allow Petrobras to drill in a block located in Amapá, 500km (311 miles) from the mouth of the Amazon River on the Brazilian Equatorial Margin.The company said it had demonstrated to the government that it had robust environmental protection structures in place.But many conservationists have raised concerns about plans, including fears that any oil spills would be in proximity, via sea currents, to the Amazon, which is home to around 10% of the world's known species.Groups such as Greenpeace have also raised concerns it could undermine Brazil's climate leadership ahead of hosting the COP30 climate summit in the Amazonian city of Belém in November.The International Energy Agency has also been clear that no new oil projects should be approved if the target of net zero global emissions is to be reached by 2050.Petrobras said in a statement that drilling was scheduled to begin \"immediately\" and that it would last for five months. The company is seeking to assess whether there is oil and gas in the area on an economically viable scale.It would not produce oil commercially at this stage.Brazil's environment minister, Marina Silva, has opposed oil exploration in the Amazon region.But the South American nation's President Lula da Silva has supported it for economic reasons and recently defended his stance.Lula told the BBC in September: \"Brazil is a country that has oil. And possibly we have oil in the Equatorial Margin, and we are making surveys. We're following the law strictly.\"He said that if there was a problem or an oil spill, then \"we will be the ones that are liable and responsible to take care of the problem, if it comes\".He added: \"I am totally in favour of a world one day that will not need any more fossil fuels, but this moment has not come yet. \"I want to know [of] any country on the planet that is prepared to have an energy transition and can give up fossil fuels.\"Other international oil companies, including Exxonmobil and Chevron, have bought \"blocks\" in the Amazon region and are awaiting licences to explore.Petrobras said it was committed to ensuring the country's \"energy security and the resources needed for a just energy transition\".It added that the company was able to \"demonstrate the robustness of the entire environmental protection structure that will be available during drilling\".",

    "description": "Japan has for the first time approved over-the-counter sales of an emergency contraceptive pill, its manufacturer says, allowing women in the country ",
    "body": "Japan has for the first time approved over-the-counter sales of an emergency contraceptive pill, its manufacturer says, allowing women in the country to take the medication without prescription.ASKA Pharmaceutical said wider access to the pill would \"empower Japanese women in the area of reproductive health\". A date for it to go on sale has yet to be announced.The pill will be labelled as \"medicine requiring guidance\", meaning women must take it in the presence of a pharmacist.The \"morning-after\" pill - a form of emergency contraception - is already available without prescription in more than 90 countries, and is designed to prevent an unwanted pregnancy.It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing or attaching to the wall of the uterus. It usually has to be taken within three to five days of having unprotected sex - but the sooner it is taken, the more effective it is.Japan's conservative views, rooted in patriarchy and deeply traditional views on the role of women, mean it has been slow to approve drugs related to women's reproductive health.ASKA Pharmaceutical said in a statement on Monday that it \"has obtained the marketing authorisation as a switch to OTC [over-the-counter] use of the emergency contraceptive pill commercialised under the trademark Norlevo\".There will be no age restrictions on buyers and no requirement for parental consent, the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported.The company said it had filed for regulatory approval in 2024, following prescription-free trial sales of the pill the year before.During the trial, Norlevo was made available at 145 pharmacies in Japan. Until then, the pill had only been supplied at clinics or pharmacies with a doctor's examination and prescription.At the time, rights groups criticised the trial, saying it was too small, and called for restrictions to be lifted. Campaigners have long argued that requiring a prescription deterred younger women and rape victims from accessing emergency contraception.Selling the drug without prescription was first discussed by a health ministry panel in 2017 - the public consultation found overwhelming support across the country.But officials stopped short of giving it the green light then, saying that making it more easily available would encourage irresponsible use of the \"morning-after\" pill.Norlevo - and the generic version levonorgestrel - works best within 72 hours after unprotected sex and has an efficacy rate of 80%.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHarry SekulichCharlotte Chess CenterDaniel Naroditsky, also known to his online fans as 'Danya', died two weeks out from his 30th birthdayUS chess grandmaster and online commentator Daniel Naroditsky has died aged 29.The popular chess player's family announced his \"unexpected\" death in a statement released by his club, the Charlotte Chess Center, on Monday. No cause of death was given.\"It is with great sadness that we share the unexpected passing of Daniel Naroditsky,\" the statement said. \"Daniel was a talented chess player, commentator and educator, and a cherished member of the chess community, admired and respected by fans and players around the world.\"The US and International chess federations have paid tribute to Naroditsky, along with other professional players.American world number two Hikaru Nakamura said he was \"devastated\" at the news.\"This is a massive loss for the world of chess,\" Nakamura said in a social media post.Naroditsky first took an interest in chess at the age of six, when his older brother Alan introduced him to the game to help entertain a group of children at a birthday party.His father Vladimir and multiple coaches soon noticed his talents.\"As far as I was concerned, I was just playing games with my brother,\" Naroditsky told the New York Times in a 2022 interview.He gained international attention in 2007 when he won the under-12 boys world youth championship in Antalya, Turkey. In 2010, at the age of 14, he became one of the youngest ever published chess authors when he wrote a book titled Mastering Positional Chess, covering practical skills and technical manoeuvrings.In 2013 Naroditsky won the US Junior Championship, helping him earn the title of grandmaster, the international chess federation's highest-ranked chess competitor, while he was still a teenager.Getty ImagesNaroditsky in 2008, following his World Youth Championship victory in TurkeyNaroditsky later graduated from Stanford University and worked as a chess coach in Charlotte, North Carolina.While still competing in high-level events, he transferred his talents to the online chess universe.Naroditsky's YouTube channel gained nearly 500,000 subscribers and his Twitch stream drummed up 340,000 followers, with hundreds of thousands of viewers drawn to his regular video tutorials and livestreams against competitors. Fans praised his insight and passion, casually referring to him as 'Danya'.In 2022 the New York Times named Naroditsky as its \"new chess columnist\" and invited him to contribute to a series of chess puzzles for the newspaper's games section.In the publication's accompanying interview, the young grandmaster mused on chess's influence in his life.\"Even at my level, I can still discover beautiful things about the game every single time I train, teach, play or am a commentator at a tournament,\" he said.",

    "body": "The body of a hostage which was handed over by Hamas on Monday night has been identified as that of Major Tal Haimi, 41, the Israeli military has said.His return means Hamas has handed over 13 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal that began on 10 October. It released all 20 living hostages when the deal was agreed.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not yet returned all the deceased hostages, with the Israeli military saying the Palestinian armed group \"is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has said it faces difficulty finding bodies under rubble in Gaza.Under the agreement, Israel has also freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians in return for every Israeli hostage's remains.The first phase has also seen an increase of aid into the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in fighting - though deadly violence flared up on Sunday as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel said it struck dozens of Hamas targets across the Strip after accusing Hamas of an attack that killed two of its soldiers in Rafah. Hamas had said it was \"unaware\" of any clashes in the area, which is under Israeli control.At least 45 Palestinians were killed in the strikes, local hospitals said.On Sunday evening, Israel said it was resuming enforcement of the ceasefire, adding that it would \"respond firmly to any violation of it\". Hamas had earlier said it remained committed to the agreement.US President Donald Trump said the truce remained in place, as his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner travelled to Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) currently holds about half of Gaza, demarcated by a so-called Yellow Line.With Palestinians expressing confusion about the exact location of the line, the IDF has put out a video showing bulldozers towing yellow blocks into place to mark it out.On Monday, Palestinian health officials said Israeli fire killed three people east of Gaza City. The IDF said its troops fired towards \"several terrorists\" who crossed the Yellow Line in the Shejaiya area.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,216 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "India's capital Delhi woke up to a toxic haze as air quality worsened after the Hindu festival of Diwali, despite a court directive to use less-polluting crackers.People in the city and its suburbs burst crackers late into Monday night, defying the court's order to use only 'green' fireworks for a limited period of time.Delhi, which has high pollution through the year due to factors including vehicular emissions and dust, had already seen air quality dipping over the past few days.On Tuesday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi was 360, according to government data. The AQI measures the level of PM 2.5 - fine particulate matter that can clog lungs and cause a host of diseases - in the air.Levels between 101 and 200 are considered moderate, while those between 201 and 300 are \"poor\". Between 301 and 400 is categorised as \"very poor\" and a figure higher than 400 is considered \"severe\".The World Health Organization's guidelines say that exposure to PM 2.5 over a 24-hour-period should be limited to 15 micrograms per cubic metre - but Delhi's AQI in some parts is 24 times higher than the recommended level. The city's pollution problem becomes worse in winter as farmers in neighbouring states burn crop stubble. Low wind speeds also trap pollutants - such as those produced by firecrackers - in the lower atmosphere, making it hard to breathe.That's why firecrackers had been banned in Delhi and its suburbs during Diwali since 2020. However, this rule was not strictly enforced on the ground and crackers were still available for purchase in many shops, leading to its use during the festival.Last week, India's Supreme Court relaxed the blanket ban, allowing people to use so-called green crackers, which its makers say emit 20-30% less pollutants than traditional ones and generate minimal ash. Critics, however, have pointed out that even though comparatively less harmful, these crackers still release toxic substances into the air.In the run-up to Diwali, BBC reporters saw traditional crackers still being sold openly in shops. And while the court had allowed green crackers to be burst only during a limited window - one hour in the morning and two in the evening on Diwali and the day before it - the sound of fireworks could be heard well past midnight in many areas.On Tuesday, when BBC reporter Vikas Pandey left his home in Noida (a suburb of Delhi) at around 0600 local time (0030 GMT) to catch an early morning flight, he realised \"the familiar smell of burning charcoal was back\". \"The air was filled with smoke and visibility was poor. I could taste ash in my mouth. As the taxi entered Delhi, visibility became even poorer. The tall buildings which are usually visible at this hour had disappeared behind a thick veil of smog,\" he says.Experts are worried that the relaxing of rules around crackers could affect awareness around the dangers of air pollution which was being developed over the past few years.To be sure, Delhi's air quality was already in the \"very poor\" category, with AQI crossing 300, for around a week now, due to several factors such as low wind speed, vehicular emissions and stubble burning in neighbouring states. On Sunday, officials invoked the next stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi and its suburbs, imposing restrictions on the use of diesel generators and burning of coal and firewood in a bid to improve air quality.For now, as the familiar smog descends on Delhi, its residents appear resigned.\"You can't even think of stepping outside. The situation seems to be equally bad in densely populated areas and rural areas in Delhi today,\" said Paras Tyagi, who lives in the capital.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "1 day agoKoh Ewein Singapore, andJake Kwonin SeoulA South Korean court has sentenced a teacher to life in prison for fatally stabbing an eight-year-old girl, in a case that shocked the nation.Myeong Jae-wan, 48, killed Kim Hae-neul after luring her into a classroom in the central city of Daejeon in February.Prosecutors had sought the death penalty for Myeong, saying that the victim's family had asked for a harsh punishment.But the court said that while \"the risk of reoffending is high, it is difficult to conclude\" that Myeong must be executed. Myeong said that she would reflect on her mistakes for the rest of her life.She said her judgement had weakened at the time of the stabbing as she was receiving mental health treatment.Prosecutors said Myeong showed no remorse while the case was being investigated. However, Myeong submitted dozens of letters to the court expressing remorse.Myeong had previously requested a six-month leave of absence, citing depression, but returned to school 20 days later, after a doctor assessed her as being fit to work, the Daejeon education office said in February.She had displayed violent behaviour in the days before the stabbing, including putting another teacher in a headlock, the education office said.On the morning of the stabbing, two education officials had visited the school to investigate that earlier altercation.Myeong told police that she had bought a weapon on the day of the attack and brought it into school, planning to kill herself along with a random child.She also told the police that she had lured Kim into the media room before attacking her.Kim, the student, was reported missing after a bus driver informed the school that she had not arrived to be picked up that day. She was found in school later that day with stab wounds, along with Myeong.Myeong also had a wound on her neck, which police said might have been self-inflicted. It was stitched up later in hospital.South Korea's leaders at the time called for safety measures to ensure such incidents never happen again.Myeong has also been ordered to wear an electronic location tracking device for 30 years.\"As an elementary school teacher, the accused was in a position to protect the victim,\" said the court's verdict on Monday. \"But she committed this brutal crime in which a child was not protected where they should be most safe.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterWatch: Bangladesh's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport engulfed in flamesBusiness leaders in Bangladesh fear losses of more than $1bn (£750m) after a devastating fire broke out in the logistics section of the country's main airport on Saturday.Clothes and raw materials were among the goods destroyed, which could put some businesses at risk, according to the country's export associations.The cause of the fire - which took 27 hours to extinguish -  is still being investigated. The blaze had forced the temporary suspension of flights and airport operations.Bangladesh is the word's second-largest exporter of clothes after China, supplying global retailers like H&M and Walmart.Bangladesh's garment sector generates around $40bn a year, accounting for over a tenth of its gross domestic product. Local media reports say around 35 people were injured while working to contain the blaze.The damaged airport cargo village is among the country's busiest logistics hubs, especially during the pre-Christmas rush. The centre stored fabrics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and other goods.Some of the goods destroyed were \"essential\" samples for securing new buyers, which means affected businesses could lose out on future opportunities, Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufactuers and Exporters Association, told reporters yesterday.In an email to the BBC, the International Air Express Association of Bangladesh also estimated damages of more than $1bn.Getty ImagesThe centre where the fire broke out stored fabrics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and other goodsThe garments association has asked all its members to submit a list of damaged goods to determine the full extent of the losses.Saturday's blaze was Bangladesh's third major fire within a week.On Tuesday, a deadly warehouse fire killed at least 16 people and injured many others. And on Thursday, another fire burned down a seven-story clothing factory in Chittagong.While investigations into Saturday's airport fire are still underway, conspiracy theories have been circulating online, linking it to the two earlier incidents and claiming all three were \"pre-planned\".In the past, the causes of such major incidents had been used by political parties to attack one another, with parties accusing opponents of exploiting the tragedies for political gain. Experts say the heightened speculation this time stems from a history of uninvestigated accusations, where no one was ever held accountable.The interim government of Bangladesh issued a statement on Saturday, saying it would take immediate and firm actions if \"any credible evidence of sabotage or arson is found\".Large fires are frequent in densely-populated Bangladesh. These are often blamed on poor infrastructure and weak safety enforcement. Hundreds of people have been killed in fires in recent years.Additional reporting by BBC Bangla.",

    "body": "Bolivia elects centrist Rodrigo Paz, ending decades of socialist rule1 day agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, in São PauloEPA/ShutterstockRodrigo Paz campaigned on a promise to bring \"capitalism for all\" to BoliviaBolivia has elected a centrist senator, Rodrigo Paz, as its next president, bringing an end to nearly 20 years of continuous rule by the Movement for Socialism (Mas) party.With almost all votes counted, Paz, of the Christian Democratic Party, defeated right-wing candidate Jorge \"Tuto\" Quiroga in Sunday's run-off election with a share of 54.6%.A severe economic crisis and infighting within Mas, which has dominated Bolivian politics since 2006, saw many voters wanting change.Paz, 58, has said he will end fuel shortages and address Bolivia's wider economic problems. In his victory speech, he said he would open up Bolivia to wider international investment and stimulate private-sector growth.Paz went from being a surprise frontrunner in the first round of the election in August to achieving a clear win over Tuto Quiroga, who received 45.4% of the votes in the run-off. The candidate for Mas did not make it into the final round of voting.Paz is perceived as relatively moderate and centrist compared to his opponent, making him more attractive to undecided and disillusioned left-leaning voters, who wanted change but did not want to cast their vote for Quiroga.Quiroga has conceded defeat and has called his rival to congratulate him. Paz's supporters took to the streets of La Paz, the country's administrative capital, to celebrate the result. One of them told news agency AFP that \"we came to celebrate the victory with great hope of a new direction for Bolivia\".EPA/ShutterstockConservative former President Jorge Quiroga had hoped to win the election this time but was beaten by PazBolivia is grappling with severe shortages of fuel leading to long queues at petrol stations, a shortage of US dollars, and soaring inflation. Natural gas exports, which were once a major source of revenue for Bolivia, have also plummeted.Paz campaigned with the slogan \"capitalism for all\", promising free-market reforms and a commitment to help the poorest in society with social programmes.He has pledged to ease access to credit for small businesses, lower certain taxes, reduce import tariffs, crack down on corruption, and decentralise the government.He has also been clear that once in power, he plans to cut fuel subsidies, which he says are unsustainable. The subsidies have kept fuel prices relatively low but - because they mean that fuel is being sold at prices below import costs - have also lead to shortages and huge queues at pumps.EPA/ShutterstockMany indigenous Bolivians traditionally supported the Mas party, but its candidate did not make it into the run-offBolivia has been relatively isolated on the world stage in recent years but Paz's election victory could signal a thawing of relations between Bolivia and the US, which have not had a formal diplomatic relationship since 2008.Relations between the two countries have been strained since 2008 when Bolivia's then-President Evo Morales expelled the US ambassador and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for allegedly conspiring against his government. The US has repeatedly accused Bolivia, one of the world's top producers of cocaine, of not meeting its anti-narcotics obligations, and has long criticised its recognition of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, whose last election was widely condemned internationally as being neither free nor fair.Reacting to Paz's election win, the US State Department said it looked forward \"to partnering with President-elect Rodrigo Paz to restore economic stability, expand private-sector growth, and strengthen security\". Once he takes office, Paz may make the calculation that distancing the country from allies including Venezuela and Cuba could help rebuild relations with US.Regarding China, an important trade partner for Bolivia which is the source of many imports and a key destination for Bolivia's minerals and lithium exports, Paz will likely try to secure new foreign investment and exports.ReutersFormer President Evo Morales was banned from running for office again - he has already been president three timesPaz's choice of running mate is thought to have helped him attract working-class voters and Bolivian's frustrated with government corruption. A former police captain, Vice-President-elect Edman Lara is known for his humble upbringing and whistleblowing on police corruption. He also a strong social media following.In the months leading up to the vote, Mas's popularity had been undermined by bitter divisions between two of its best known figures: the former president, Evo Morales, and the outgoing president, Luis Arce. Morales, who governed from 2006-2019, was disqualified from running in this election due to a ruling that limits presidents to two terms in office. As Morales has served a total of three terms as president - one before the constitutional two-term limit came into force - he was not able to stand again for the top job.Accused of statutory rape and fathering a child with a teenager - allegations he denies and says are politically motivated - he has been living in his stronghold of Chapare, where he is protected by his loyal supporters who have at times staged protests and roadblocks around the country leading to clashes. As voting is mandatory in Bolivia, he urged his supporters to spoil their votes rather than cast a ballot paper for either of the two candidates in the run-off. For many Bolivians, this election result reflects a desire for change and renewal. But Paz inherits tough economic circumstances and a bitterly divided country.Restoring economic credibility and uniting a country polarised into many factions after years of political turmoil will not be an easy task.Paz will take office on 8 November.More on the Bolivian election",

    "body": "Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now12 hours agoAna Faguy,James FitzGerald andNardine SaadGetty ImagesThe pair's divorce was finalised in 2007The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair's tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears's allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book's release by publisher Listenin. He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.When they were teenagers, the couple's sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. \"They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - 'Oh, you're awake?' - with a knife in her hand,\" he writes. \"Then she'd turn around and pad off without explanation.\"Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: \"The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it's racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we're getting close to the 11th hour.\"He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears's life were controlled by others for years.Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could \"never fully get behind it\".What's the history of their relationship?The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears's initial commercial peak started to wane.They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.She made headlines with incidents like shaving her head and hitting a photographer's car with an umbrella.Those public incidents raised concern about her mental welfare, and after she was taken to hospital twice, a temporary conservatorship was established in 2008 and made permanent later that year.Spears remained under that controversial arrangement until 2021, under which her father and others controlled her finances and aspects of her personal life. She did not regain custody of her children until after it was lifted.What has Spears said? Spears has accused Federline of attacking her during his recent press appearances to promote the book. She described the contents of the memoir as \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\", but suggested the work would sell better than her own memoir had done.In that book, The Woman in Me, Spears accused her ex-husband of trying to \"convince everyone I was completely out of control\".Spears has also defended her relationship with her sons. \"I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys,\" she wrote on social media on 15 October, adding that \"relationships with teenage boys is complex\".In a statement to US media, a Spears spokesperson added: \"With news from Kevin's book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James, and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.\"The BBC has contacted Federline's lawyer for comment on Spears's counter-accusations.",

    "body": "11 hours agoMark Lowen andAlison RobertsLisbonA preliminary report into last month's funicular crash in Lisbon that killed 16 people has detailed a litany of failings.Portugal's Air and Rail Accident Investigations Bureau said an underground cable - which acted as a counterweight between two carriages and broke, causing the crash - was defective and had never been certified for passenger transportation. It said the cable was not technically suitable and was acquired in 2022 by Carris, the company running Lisbon's public transport that now says it has dismissed its head of maintenance of furniculars and trams.The 140-year-old Glória funicular, popular with tourists, derailed and crashed into a building on 3 September.There were 11 foreigners among those killed, including the three British nationals, while another 20 people were injured.The preliminary report, released on Monday, said there had been no oversight by Carris engineers and the cable was not tested before it was installed. The supervision and maintenance of the funicular by a company outsourced by Carris also did not work properly - apparently giving the Glória funicular the all-clear on the morning of the disaster, though it is not certain if the check actually took place that day.The emergency brake system, which the driver correctly tried to apply when the cable snapped, did not function properly and was never tested in advance, the report said.However, the preliminary report emphasised that the information gathered to date was \"incomplete\", with further tests and analysis needed.\"The guilt or responsibility of any organisation or person involved in the incident should not be presumed,\" it said.Lisbon's Mayor Carlos Moedas, who was re-elected on 12 October despite opposition accusations he had failed in his duty of oversight over the city's funiculars, told SIC television that the report \"reaffirms that the unfortunate tragedy... was due to technical and not political causes\".Carris issued a statement stressing it was \"not possible at this time to state whether or not the non-conformities in the use of the cable are relevant to the accident\", referring to a passage in the report that notes the same cables had been in use on the Glória funicular for 601 days without incident.According to the accident report: \"At this point in time, it cannot be said whether the use of this type of non-compliant cable intervened, or what intervention it had, in the rupture... and it is certain for the investigation that there were other factors that had to intervene.\"The company stressed that, though the cables had been brought into use under the current board of directors, who took office in May 2022, the acquisition process took place under the previous board.Among other safety recommendations to be further detailed are that Carris implement a new safety management system in line with European best practice.The full report will take about 11 months to complete. If that is delayed, a more detailed interim report will be released instead.Meanwhile, all Lisbon cable cars have been ordered to be out of service until the necessary safety checks are put in place. All braking systems need to be reviewed to see if they can stop the carriages if the cable fails - which had not been the case in the Glória accident - the report advised.It also recommended closing a loophole whereby Lisbon's historic funiculars are exempt from legal and supervisory oversight that applies to other cable-driven forms of transport.",

    "body": "11 minutes agoTom Bennettin Jerusalem, andAlaa Daraghmein Ramallah, occupied West BankA 55-year-old Palestinian woman has been taken to hospital after being clubbed over the head by a masked Jewish settler as she was picking olives.The unprovoked attack, which took place on Sunday morning in the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya in the occupied West Bank, was captured on video by US journalist Jasper Nathaniel.Mr Nathaniel said the settler knocked the woman unconscious with his stick, before hitting her again as she lay on the ground. She has been named as Afaf Abu Alia, known locally as Umm Saleh. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC the confrontation was dispersed after its forces arrived, and that it \"strongly condemns any form of violence\" by settlers. But Mr Nathaniel rejected this account, saying \"no Israeli forces showed up to the attack at any point\". He said Israeli soldiers had been on-site prior to the attack and had \"lured\" him and others into an \"ambush\". He said soldiers \"sped off\" just before the settlers launched the assault. The BBC has put this specific allegation to the IDF. At least 80% of residents of Turmus Ayya hold US citizenship or residency, according to Israeli media. Mr Nathaniel is also a US citizen. He shared messages on social media that he said were between him and a US embassy official, who told him they were not in a position to offer to protect him nor the US citizens in the area. Sent a list of questions by the BBC, the US State Department declined to comment on the specific incident. It said this was due to \"privacy and other considerations\". It added it had \"no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens\" and took seriously its commitment to assist them abroad.The young male attacker is seen in the footage wielding a large wooden stick with a knot at one end, reminiscent of a club, before he swings it overhead and strikes Mrs Abu Alia.\"It's the most vivid image that's ever been seared in my mind,\" Mr Nathaniel told the BBC.\"He swings it one time and I saw her body go completely limp. And then he stood over her and hit her twice more.\"The mother of five is then seen bleeding as she is carried into a vehicle to be taken to hospital. She was initially admitted to an intensive care unit but is now in a stable condition, doctors say.Her cousin, Hamdi Abu Alia, told the BBC that medical staff found she had been struck twice in the head. Amin Abu Alia, the mayor of the adjacent village al-Mughayyir, confirmed details of the attack to the BBC.The attack was part of a wider incident in which at least 15 masked settlers were seen hurling stones and attacking other Palestinians who were harvesting olives - as well as activists who had arrived to support them, including Mr Nathaniel.At least one car was torched. Others had their windows smashed.It is one of a spate of attacks in recent weeks linked to the olive harvest, which officially began on 9 October. The harvest is an age-old ritual that forms a major part of Palestinian culture. It is also an economic necessity for many, but is increasingly precarious.Farmers across the West Bank - internationally regarded as Palestinian land occupied by Israel - face heightened risks during harvest season, including organised assaults and the use of force by Israeli security forces to block roads and Palestinians' access to their lands.Of the 71 settler attacks documented by the UN's humanitarian office, Ocha, across the West Bank between 7 and 13 October, half were related to the ongoing harvest season. The attacks affected Palestinians in 27 villages.In 2025, more than 3,200 Palestinians have been injured in settler attacks across the West Bank, according to Ocha.Attacks are intended, monitors say, to intimidate Palestinians and eventually drive them from their land so settlers can seize it. The vast majority go unpunished, with just 3% of official investigations into settler violence between 2005 and 2023 ending in a conviction, according to Israeli civil rights group Yesh Din. Many incidents are not investigated.Shortly after entering office, US President Donald Trump cancelled a range of sanctions imposed on Israeli settlers by his predecessor Joe Biden.Additional reporting by Tom Bateman",

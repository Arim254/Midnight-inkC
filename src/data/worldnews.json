    "body": "24 hours agoKatya AdlerEurope editorBBCDowntown Munich is best-known for chic shops and flashy fast cars but right now its streets are bedecked with posters advertising next generation drones.\"Europe's security under construction\" boasts the slogan on an eye-catching set of sleek black-and-white photographs, festooned across a scaffolding-clad church on one of this town's best known pedestrian boulevards.Such an unapologetic public display of military muscle would have been unimaginable here just a few years ago, but the world outside Germany is changing fast, and taking this country with it.The southern region of Bavaria has become Germany's leading defence technology hub, focusing on AI, drones and aerospace.Advertisements such as these that say \"Europe's security under construction\" would have been unthinkable in Germany not long agoPeople here, like most other Europeans, say they feel increasingly exposed - squeezed between an expansionist Russia and an economically aggressive China to the east, and an increasingly unpredictable, former best pal, the United States, to the west.According to a recent Eurobarometer poll, more than two-thirds of Europeans (68%) feel their country is under threat.This autumn, Germany's Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance warned for the first time since the Cold War that war is no longer \"unlikely\". While emphasising that this is a safe country, it also recommends that Germans keep food supplies to last three to ten days at home. Just in case.Germany is the number one single donor of military and other aid to Ukraine, now that the US has halted any new direct aid. Opinion polls suggest voters here want to feel better protected at home too.AFP via Getty ImagesGermany is now the single biggest giver of aid to UkraineThe question for this country, along with others in Europe is whether traditional alliances with the US, in Nato and the EU can suffice, or whether they should be diversifying into ad-hoc coalitions alongside other like-minded nations such as Australia, South Korea and Japan?Precarious relationsBy 2029, the German defence budget will be higher than the UK and French equivalents combined, Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte pointed out to me.He described the €150bn they say they will spend on defence as \"a staggering amount\".It's something the United States notices and appreciates, he said. Donald Trump is far from the first US president to insist that Europe do more for its own security, though his tone has been noticeably more threatening than that of his predecessors.The precarious state of transatlantic relations was the main focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) this weekend. It's the world's biggest annual defence meeting, bringing leaders, security experts and defence industries together.Mark Rutte (pictured speaking to Katya Adler), described the E150bn Germany will spend on defence \"a staggering amount\"While it's easy to dismiss speech-heavy get-togethers like this as wind-baggy talking shops, in the turbulent times we live in, they can make a difference - especially the informal private huddles between global decision makers, far away from the glare of the cameras.The most eagerly - and for some the most anxiously - anticipated speech at this year's conference was that of the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who represented the Trump administration here.European leaders and top diplomats were seriously on the edge of their seats. But why was a simple 30-minute address given so much importance?It's because Europe-US relations have never been so frayed as they are now, over the last 80 years since World War Two. And this isn't a bust-up between buddies that will easily blow over.Denmark still furiousIn the just over 12 months since Trump returned to the White House, he has at times insulted and undermined European leaders, slapped big tariffs on their exports, and most shockingly of all to his allies in Nato, threatened Danish sovereignty over its territory, Greenland, refusing for a while to rule out taking the island by force.Speaking at the MSC on Saturday, Denmark's still clearly furious prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Trump's designs on Greenland remained \"the same\" despite ongoing trilateral talks between representatives of Greenland, the US and Denmark.Trump has ruled out taking Greenland by military force for now, and he's backed away (for the moment, at least) from slapping economic sanctions on allies, including the UK, France and Germany, that were getting in the way of the US acquiring the Arctic island. But transatlantic trust was severely damaged.European powers see in Trump a truly transactional president who thinks nothing of leveraging security or economic relations with his closest allies to get what he wants. Just before being re-elected president, for example, he told Europeans that the US would not protect nations that didn't pay their way on defence.It is true though, that Europe has been coasting on America's security blanket for decades. Critics in the US argue that European nations have been able to run generous welfare states for decades while Washington picked up the tab for security spending.AFP via Getty ImagesThe speech by US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio (left) was the most eagerly anticipated at the conferenceGermany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, told me on Saturday: \"We got used to the strong support from the US;  we got used to our comfort zone in which we used to live. This time is over, definitely over,\" he said. \"Washington was right.\"But the crisis over Greenland and other actions by the Trump administration - such as when it temporarily paused intelligence-sharing with Ukrainian forces last March, leaving them blind on the battlefield, in order to pressure Kyiv into engaging in peace talks with Moscow - have left deep scars and a troubling sense of transatlantic wariness.Hence the trepidation in Munich before Rubio took the stage.In the end, his words were laced with a sense of historic kinship. \"We want Europe to be strong,\" he said. \"The two great wars of the last century serve for us as a constant reminder that ultimately our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"I found it telling that so many leading European figures in the audience jumped on the warmth of his words, rising to their feet to applaud the US Secretary of State. They were clearly relieved he hadn't threatened or berated Europe as the US Vice President JD Vance famously did at last year's MSC.But for those listening closely, Rubio's speech was loyal to themes close to the heart of the Trump administration and hard for many European leaders to swallow: anti climate action, sceptical of globalisation, multilateralism, migration and pro the building of a new era of Christian western civilisation.Rubio was clear: the US wasn't interested in allies clinging to the old status quo. It wanted to forge a new path, ideally alongside Europe, but only if it shared the same values.This US offer of close partnership was conditional and absent of a sense of compromise.\"A bit like a (psychologically) abusive partner,\" said one European diplomat, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity. \"He reminded Europe how wonderful the (transatlantic) relationship used to be, but he then switched to coercion: If you want things to be good between us in the future, you have to do as I say!\"Another diplomat pointed out that, while talking of shared values, it was telling, he said, that of all the European countries that Rubio could have gone to after making his speech in Germany, he chose to visit Slovakia and Hungary before heading back to the US.They are viewed by Brussels as two of the EU's most problematic members, both with Eurosceptic nationalist prime ministers who oppose sending military aid to Ukraine and who are tough on migration.A fragile new relationshipRubio's softer tone also divided European leaders who had recently spoken as one, in defence of Denmark, at the height of the Greenland crisis last month.The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, underlined a now fragile relationship with the US, despite Rubio's gentler rhetoric. \"Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,\" she said. \"Europeans have suffered shock therapy.\"But will some countries in Europe grasp what warmness there was in Rubio's speech as an excuse not to rush to boost defence spending as promised? The coffers of most European governments are over stretched already and their voters tend to prioritise cost-of-living concerns over defence budgets.Reuters\"Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,\" according to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der LeyenRachel Ellehuus, Director-General of defence think-tank RUSI told me she sees a rift opening up across the continent.On the one hand, you have the Nordic and Baltic nations that are geographically close to Russia, and also Germany and the Netherlands, which are all big defence spenders, she says, whereas in southern Europe, there's Spain, for example, that is absolutely unapologetic about refusing to increase defence budgets to the levels demanded by Donald Trump.France and Britain are both verbally committed to boosting defence spending, says Ellehuus, but are still looking for a \"political band aid\" to help them explain to voters the trade-offs that will involve - higher taxes, less welfare or more borrowing.\"Europeans need to get to work yesterday and to focus,\" she says. \"They have 5-10 years to stand on their own two feet in terms of conventional defence capabilities.\"Last week, U.S. Undersecretary of Defence Elbridge Colby couldn't have been more stark in his messaging at a meeting of Nato defence ministers he attended in Brussels: Europe was no longer a US priority, the Indo-Pacific was.\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are reprioritising the defence of our homeland and the protection of our interests in our Hemisphere,\" he said.While he emphasised that the US remained committed to Nato's mutual defence clause, where an attack against one member is viewed as an attack against all, Colby insisted the US would be reducing its capabilities in Europe, becoming \"a more limited and focused\" presence.Europe had to become a partner, rather than a dependent, he said, calling for a new \"Nato 3.0\". The old world order with the West at its core, has faded but the MSC this weekend made clear that what comes next for Europe and the US is still very much up in the air.Marco Rubio called for a new century of western civilisation, Elbridge Colby wants a re-vamped Nato, while the UK's prime minister appealed in Munich for the western alliance to be re-made.Starmer's nuanced approachIn stark contrast to Marco Rubio's insistence on greater national sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defence - to cut re-armament costs, though, he emphasised this did not mean the UK turning its back on the United States.Sophia Gaston, national security expert at Kings College London, told me that in Munich, Starmer was able to better articulate the nuance of Britain's strategic outlook.\"Other allies in Europe may be more willing to speak of divergence from Washington\", she says, \"but for Britain it remains a strategic imperative to triangulate within the Transatlantic relationship. There will also be times when Britain will have to make hard choices, and Starmer appeared more confident in confronting that reality.\"The key is to have a really strong grasp of the national interest and our instruments of power and influence. This requires a much more competitive approach that has not always felt natural to Britain, which has typically pursued much of its diplomacy in elegant, consensus-focused and invisible ways.\"PA MediaKeir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defenceIn these fast-moving, unpredictable times, Europe's leaders are increasingly turning to a la carte coalitions, alongside traditional organisations like Nato or the EU, which are larger and therefore often slower to react. These groupings also include non-European nations.Take, for example, the so-called Coalition of the Willing group of countries, led by the UK and France and formed to secure Ukrainian sovereignty in the case of an eventual peace deal with Russia. Turkey has attended coalition meetings, as have New Zealand and Australia.More from InDepthCanada is increasingly working alongside Nordic and Baltic nations that share geopolitical challenges and common values, they say, and want to promote stability and deterrence from the edges of the Baltic Sea, through the Nordic and Baltic states, through the North Atlantic, Greenland and across the Canadian arctic.One European policy-maker who asked not to be named joked to me that Canada was becoming \"more and more European by the day\". Japan and South Korea were increasingly seen as part of the \"like-minded family\" too, he said.Not just defenceThese ad hoc coalitions are not restricted to defence alone. France's President Macron has long called for Europe to increase what he calls its strategic autonomy, in traditional security terms but also energy security, supply chains and new technologies. In Munich he recommended Europe \"de-risk\" from all outside powers.This weekend even saw the president of the European Commission admitting that if the EU failed to move fast enough on improving competitiveness, \"a group of its member states would have to move forward alone\".Attempts by smaller pockets of European powers to work together to advance European strategic independence are by no means always successful. Take the current row between France and Germany over their joint attempt to come up with the next generation of fighter jet with the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).You could also say that for all the talk of building European independence, this weekend's conference was also a reminder of just how dependent Europe remains on US security support - from its nuclear umbrella to intelligence sharing and command and control structures. It was also a reminder of how far Europe trails the US in high tech innovation.But more than short-term mechanisms designed to 'survive' Donald Trump, the changes we are witnessing in Europe, including closer alliances outside the continent, are liable to be longer lasting. The world now seems to dance to the tune of big power politics. And even slow-moving Europe is having to adapt.Top picture credit: AFP / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "21 hours agoGavin ButlerGetty ImagesNaveed Akram spoke for the first time since his arrest on Monday – saying just one wordAccused Bondi Beach gunman Naveed Akram faced court for the first time on Monday, two months after he and his father allegedly carried out Australia's worst mass shooting in almost 30 years.The 24-year-old appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison. He faces 59 charges relating to the Bondi Beach shooting, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist attack.Sajid, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene, while Naveed was critically injured and later transferred from hospital to prison.Monday was the first time Akram had been seen on screen and spoken since his arrest – saying just one word when Deputy Chief Magistrate Sharon Freund asked if he heard a discussion about an extension of suppression orders: \"Yeah\".The court orders cover the identities of those who survived the shooting, but allow the survivors to self-identify if they wish.Outside court, Akram's lawyer, Ben Archbold, said it was too early to say what plea his client would enter, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.He said Akram was doing \"as well as can be expected\" while in custody in Goulburn supermax prison.\"Everyone knows it's supermax … very onerous conditions,\" Archbold told journalists.When asked if Akram had given a police interview, he said \"All we've done is start the process. We're waiting for the brief to be served. There's nothing more I can say.\"One video - taken on one of their mobile phones in October - was described as showing the men sitting in front of an image of an Islamic State group (IS) flag.They could be heard making statements about their motivations for the attack and condemning \"the acts of 'Zionists'\", police said.Police said separate footage from October showed the father and son \"conducting firearms training in a countryside location\", believed to be in New South Wales.They were seen \"firing shotguns and moving in a tactical manner\", officials added.Authorities earlier confirmed that two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl were among the victims of the Bondi Beach attack.Akram is next due in court in April.",

All 29 passengers have been rescued, while one of the injured was sent to hospital, police said.Switzerland has experienced heavy rain and snow in recent days, and the country's Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research says the avalanche risk is very high across the alps.\"According to initial findings, an avalanche may have crossed the tracks shortly before the train passed,\" police stated, adding that the public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation.\"Five people were injured. One of them was taken to hospital,\" police added.The regional commuter train was on its way from Spiez to Brig when it derailed.Goppenstein, a key hub for road and rail transport, sits at the exit of the Lotschberg rail tunnel. The train derailed as it was exiting the tunnel, police said.The region is under its second highest avalanche warning - level four of five.Heavy snow also resulted in 50 people being evacuated from the village of Orsieres, near the French border.Skiers have been warned by authorities to stay on the marked slopes, and those walking in the mountains should also check avalanche bulletins before setting off.Last month, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing in the Swiss alps.",

    "body": "21 hours agoAlicia CurryProtesters, police and military clashTwo female Israeli soldiers had to be rescued by police after being chased by a crowd of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men.Footage from the city of Bnei Brak showed the women running through streets strewn with rubbish and overturned bins as police officers formed a protective barrier. More than 20 people were arrested.Reports suggest the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers were wrongly believed to be trying to deliver army conscription orders. Military service is mandatory for most Jewish Israelis, but ultra‑Orthodox Jews have long been exempt. Moves to reform this have caused outrage among the community.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the incident as \"unacceptable\".ReutersPolice used stun grenades to disperse the crowds in the city of Bnei Brak\"This is an extreme minority that does not represent the entire Haredi [ultra-Orthodox] community,\" Netanyahu said in a post on X. \"We will not allow anarchy, and we will not tolerate any harm to IDF servicemen and security forces who carry out their duties with dedication and determination.\"Jewish religious leaders also condemned the actions of those involved in the unrest.Riot police in Bnei Brak, on the edge of Tel Aviv, used stun grenades against the crowd and arrested 23 people, police said in a statement.Three officers were injured and several police vehicles damaged, including a patrol car that was overturned and a police motorcycle that was set on fire, police added.The IDF servicewomen had been on an official home visit to another soldier when the confrontation broke out, Israeli broadcaster Kan reported.ReutersThe ultra-Orthodox population now accounts for 14% of the Israeli populationThe issue of conscription has become increasingly contentious during the war in Gaza, with the Israeli government now debating draft legislation that would require ultra-Orthodox men not in full-time religious study to serve.Since the State of Israel was declared in 1948, students enrolled full-time at a religious school, or yeshiva, have been exempted from conscription. That exemption was ruled unconstitutional by Israel's High Court of Justice more than a decade ago. Temporary arrangements to continue it were formally ended by the court last year, forcing the government to begin conscripting the community.The ultra-Orthodox population has more than doubled its share of Israel's population over the past seven decades, and now accounts for 14%.",

    "body": "Ancient bone may prove legendary war elephant crossing of Alps12 hours agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterGetty ImagesHannibal's invasion of Europe has acquired almost mythical statusAn elephant foot bone found by archaeologists digging in southern Spain may be evidence that a troop of war elephants stomped through ancient Europe.It would be the first concrete proof of the legendary Carthaginian General Hannibal's troop of battle elephants, according to academics.Drawings of Hannibal's war against the Romans had long suggested that the beasts were used in fighting, but no hard evidence backed up the theories.Now the creatures' skeletal remains appear to have been found in an Iron Age dig near Cordoba.\"Beyond ivory, the discovery of elephant remains in European archaeological contexts is exceptionally rare,\" says the team of scientists in a paper published in Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.Often considered one of the most successful commanders of classical times, Hannibal led his army from the powerful imperial city Carthage, in modern day Tunisia, into Europe as he battled to control the Mediterranean.It is thought he took soldiers and animals from Carthage through Spain and France to invade Italy, crossing the Alps with 37 elephants in 218 BCE during the second of the so-called Punic Wars.The remains found in Spain are presumed to be from an animal that died before reaching the Alps.The archaeologists, led by Professor Rafael M. Martínez Sánchez, found the elephant's bone beneath a collapsed wall on a site called Colina de los Quemados. Martínez Sánchez et alThe top row is the Iron Age elephant bone found in SpainThey used carbon dating techniques to estimate the age of the 10cm cube-shaped bone. The result led them to believe it is from the Second Punic War.They also compared the bone of modern elephants and steppe mammoths to determine which animal it came from.The team found artillery, coins and ceramics during the excavations in 2020, providing more clues that the place was the site of a battle.\"As non-native species and the largest living terrestrial animals, these imported beasts would have required transportation by ship,\" the academics said.They say that it is very unlikely that dead animals were transported, and the bones are unattractive suggesting they were not decorative or used in craft.But the scientists say it will be very challenging to work out which species of elephant the creature was.\"While [the bone] would not represent one of the mythical specimens Hannibal took across the Alps, it could potentially embody the first known relic − so sought after by European scholars of the Modern Age − of the animals used in the Punic Roman wars for the control of the Mediterranean,\" the scientists conclude in their paper.",

    "body": "11 hours agoCBS via Getty ImagesDuvall played mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II Robert Duvall was a distinguished and prolific screen actor who lent a brooding intensity and grizzled authority to seven decades of American film-making.Nominated for Academy Awards on seven occasions, he won best actor for his role as a troubled country singer in 1983's Tender Mercies.His many other roles included a mafia consigliere in The Godfather, a bombastic army officer in Apocalypse Now, and a Texas Ranger-turned-cattle driver in Lonesome Dove.More character actor than leading man, he could be relied upon to inject a feisty, fiery machismo and a cantankerous contrariness into the most mainstream Hollywood offering.Born Robert Selden Duvall in January 1931 in San Diego, California, Duvall was a self-proclaimed \"navy brat\" due to his father's life-long career in the United States Navy.His father expected him to follow him into the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Yet his son instead served two years in the army following his 1953 college graduation.Getty ImagesDuvall and Dustin Hoffman, pictured in 2014, studied acting together in the 1950sDuvall subsequently moved to New York to study acting, working as a postal clerk to make ends meet. His classmates included Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman, who both became lifelong friends.\"A friend is someone who many years ago offered you his last $300 when you broke your pelvis,\" he would later recall. \"A friend is Gene Hackman.\"Duvall began acting professionally at the Gateway Playhouse, a summer theatre in Long Island, where he starred in plays by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and others.His performance in Horton Foote's one-act play The Midnight Caller led the playwright to recommend him for the role of Boo Radley in the 1962 film version of To Kill a Mockingbird.By that time, Duvall had already appeared on television in such shows as Naked City, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Armstrong Circle Theatre.To Kill a Mockingbird, which Foote adapted from Harper Lee's novel, was the actor's first film role and led to appearances in such films as The Chase, Bullitt and True Grit.Getty ImagesDuvall played the reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a MockingbirdThe Rain People, released in 1969, marked his first collaboration with director Francis Ford Coppola, with whom he would go on to work in the first two Godfather films.Other significant roles around this time included the highly strung Major Burns in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and THX 1138, the eponymous protagonist of George Lucas's dystopian 1971 sci-fi debut.Duvall's performance as The Godfather's Tom Hagen, the shrewd chief advisor to Marlon Brando's ageing Don Vito Corleone, earned him his first Academy Award nomination in 1973.He reprised the role in 1974's The Godfather Part II, by which time he had collaborated with Foote again in the 1972 film of his play Tomorrow. Network, from 1976, cast him as a venal television producer.Meanwhile, there were appearances with Michael Caine in The Eagle Has Landed, Laurence Olivier in The Betsy, and Muhammad Ali in the boxer's biopic The Greatest.Getty ImagesRobert Duvall (centre) on the Apocalypse Now setIn 1979, Duvall gave perhaps his most memorable performance as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore in Coppola's Vietnam war epic Apocalypse Now.\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" his character famously declared after leading a deadly helicopter attack on a Vietnamese village.The actor was shown to no less domineering effect in The Great Santini, playing a frustrated Marine pilot who hectors and browbeats his teenage children.The scene in which he torments his son by bouncing a basketball against his head was spoofed by Mike Myers' Dr Evil in the second Austin Powers film.Duvall's work in Apocalypse Now and The Great Santini saw him nominated for Oscars in consecutive years. The former also earned him a Bafta and the first of four Golden Globe awards.Yet it was his role as alcoholic singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies that finally saw him land an Oscar, beating an all-British line-up of fellow nominees that included Caine and Albert Finney.Watch: Robert Duvall honoured in Hollywood 'hand and footprint ceremony' in 2011Duvall's other Oscar nominations came for his performances in 1997's The Apostle, 1998 legal drama A Civil Action and 2014's The Judge.In The Apostle, which he also wrote and directed, the actor played an evangelical preacher who begins a new life in Louisiana after committing a crime.In real life, Duvall attended church regularly during his childhood but was reluctant to discuss his faith, merely disclosing he had \"always been a believer\".The staunch Republican was less reticent about his political persuasions and was a guest at President George W Bush's inauguration in 2001.Duvall's other many screen roles included an LA police office in Colors, an astronaut in Deep Impact, and a Nascar crew chief in Days of Thunder alongside Tom Cruise.He was reunited with Cruise in 2012's Jack Reacher, in which Duvall played a former soldier turned gun shop owner.Yet Duvall often looked happiest when riding a horse, be it in the acclaimed TV mini-series Lonesome Dove or in the Kevin Costner Western Open Range.\"I think the Western kind of defines us,\" the actor said in 2016. \"The English have Shakespeare; the French, Moliere; the Russians have Chekhov. But the Western is ours.\"Getty ImagesDuvall was named best actor at the 1984 Academy AwardsHis other passions included football, the tango and the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, a city he professed to love \"more than any place else\".\"A young actor once asked me 'What do you do between jobs?'\" he once recalled. \"I said, 'Hobbies, hobbies and more hobbies'. It keeps you off dope.\"Duvall was married and divorced three times and is survived by his fourth wife, the Argentine actress Luciana Pedraza. He did not father any children, commenting in 2003 that it had \"never worked out\".",

    "body": "17 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterMiguel Gutierrez/EPA/ShutterstockMany of those protesting outside the Zona 7 detention centre are wearing T-shirts reading \"free all the political prisoners\" and carrying pictures of their jailed relativesPressure is growing on the Venezuelan interim government to free the remaining political prisoners being held in the country.A pressure group campaigning on detainees' behalf, Foro Penal, said on Sunday that it had been able to verify that 444 political prisoners had been released since US forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro last month.But hundreds more remain behind bars, according to a tally kept by Foro Penal, even though the Trump administration has pressured Venezuelan officials to speed up their release.Activists say the health of some relatives who have gone on hunger strike to demand the release of their loved ones is quickly deteriorating.Opposition party Vente Venezuela posted footage of one of the relatives - who appears to be unconscious - being tended to by others outside the Zona 7 detention centre in the capital, Caracas. According to a pressure group, 10 people went on hunger strike on Saturday to demand that their relatives, who are being held at Zona 7, be freed. They have been holding a vigil outside the police detention centre since 8 January, when the head of Venezuela's National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez, first announced that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture to demonstrate what he said was the interim government's will \"seek peace\".While the Trump administration has praised Venezuela's interim government for the progress it has made so far, activists within the South American country have denounced delays and a lack of transparency in who is being freed.Members of the opposition have also denounced that those who have been released have been barred from speaking out publicly.They cite the case of opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa as evidence that those released are not \"really free\". Guanipa was released on 8 February after eight months in jail, only to be seized again hours later for allegedly breaking the conditions of his release. He has since been placed under house arrest.Last week, students took to the streets to demand an amnesty for those who have been jailed as part of the widespread repression against critics of the government of  Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela's interim government - led by Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez - has put forward an amnesty bill since Maduro was removed from power in a US raid on 3 January.The bill passed its first reading unanimously on 5 February but lawmakers failed to approve it as scheduled last week as they could not agree on how it should be applied. The bill is due to be discussed further this week.",

    "body": "19 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesDisney owns multiple franchises, including Marvel and its characters like Spider-ManChinese technology giant ByteDance has pledged to curb a controversial artificial intelligence (AI) video-making tool, following threats of legal action from Disney and complaints from other entertainment giants.In the last few days, videos made using the latest version of the app Seedance have proliferated online. Many have been lauded for their realism.On Friday, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance accusing it of supplying Seedance with a \"pirated library\" of the studio's copyrighted characters, including those from Marvel and Star Wars.Disney's lawyers accused ByteDance of committing a \"virtual smash-and-grab\" of their intellectual property, including superheroes from Marvel, Star Wars and various cartoons.On Monday ByteDance told the BBC that the company \"respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.\"\"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users.\"ByteDance did not respond to questions asking for details on the safeguards it plans to implement.Like other generative-AI tools, Seedance can create videos based on short text prompts.Many of Seedance's clips are based on real actors and shows and some have gone viral since the launch of its latest 2.0 version on 12 February. The BBC has found clips online said to have been generated by Seedance showing Star Wars characters Anakin Skywalker and Rey battling with their lightsabres, and Spider-Man fighting Captain America on the streets of New York.The company has not disclosed what data it uses to train Seedance.ByteDance had previously said the product had already paused the ability for users to upload images of real people. The company also said it respects intellectual property rights and copyright protections, and takes any potential infringement seriously.Disney last year struck a $1bn (£730m) deal with the maker of ChatGPT and video-generation tool Sora, OpenAI, giving the platforms access to 200 characters from its franchises including Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.Disney's legal threat follows criticism from other organisations in Hollywood over the Seedance platform. Paramount Skydance has reportedly also sent Bytedance a cease-and-desist letter demanding Seedance stops using its content. Paramount Skydance has been approached for comment. The Motion Picture Association, which represents major US studios like Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount and Netflix, has demanded that the tool \"immediately cease its infringing activity\".Actors' union Sag-Aftra has also accused Seedance of \"blatant infringement\".Meanwhile the Japanese government has launched an investigation into the Chinese firm over potential copyright violations, after AI-generated videos of popular Japanese anime characters showed up on online.Other AI image‑generation tools have likewise been hit with legal action.Last year, Disney and NBCUniversal sued AI image generator Midjourney, accusing the platform of generating \"endless unauthorised copies\" of the studios' copyrighted works. The case is ongoing.Disney has also asked Google to restrict the generation of its characters on Google's AI platforms.",

    "body": "24 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSuppliedPolice say Chris Baghsarian, 85, was kidnapped from his home in the Sydney suburb of North Ryde by mistake.Sydney police have appealed for the return of an 85-year-old whom they believe was kidnapped by mistake.Chris Baghsarian, who lived alone, was taken from his house in the suburb of North Ryde by at least three attackers early on Friday morning, and bundled into a dark-coloured SUV. \"They were intending to take somebody, but have taken the wrong person,\" Det Acting Supt Andrew Marks told reporters on Monday, adding that no ransom note had been received.\"The family are in distress. All they want is their father to be returned, their grandfather to be returned,\" he said, appealing for people to report any unusual activity seen around properties known to be empty.The appeal came as the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) reported that videos and images of a severely injured Baghsarian in an unknown location were circulating in Sydney's underworld.\"It's not ideal that those images are out there,\" Marks said, noting that Baghsarian needed daily medication and that \"every hour is very important\".\"I have seen the videos,\" he add. \"They are distressing to see an 85-year-old man in that condition.\"He said that in a \"normal\" kidnapping case, \"we would be aware of a ransom\". \"But because the family are not involved in this type of crime, and they're not involved in that world, they haven't received a ransom.\" Cases of mistaken identity have become increasingly common in Sydney's underworld, the SMH reported, as large organised crime networks increasingly subcontract crimes.Last year a 23-year-old plumber was shot dead in his driveway in Condell Park in what police believe was also a case of mistaken identity.He was \"a million per cent confident they have the wrong person,\" Marks said but would not elaborate on who police thought the intended target was.\"The fact that these offenders – these kidnappers – have got it so wrong is concerning.\"CCTV footage published by local media showed an SUV driving up outside Baghsarian's home on Friday. Two hooded figures then approach the house before reappearing with someone who is struggling in their arms and then loaded into the SUV.A burnt out vehicle matching the description of the getaway car was found in the nearby suburb of South Turramurra shortly afterwards.Police said Baghsarian was wearing grey pajamas and a red and blue flannelette shirt when he was kidnapped.New South Wales Premier Chris Minns has also pleaded for Baghsarian's safe return.\"Let police know where he's currently located or alternatively drop Mr Baghsarian off at a shopping centre or an emergency department or even a nursing home,\" he appealed to the kidnappers. \"We urge them to do that as soon as possible.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoTom BennettReutersMany have been held in Roj camp for nearly seven years, since IS lost its last territorial foothold in Syria in 2019A group of 34 Australian women and children who have been held in a camp in northern Syria for nearly seven years due to their links to the Islamic State (IS) group were released on Monday to head home, but then returned to the camp for \"technical reasons\".The group - thought by authorities to be the wives and children of IS fighters - have been stuck in Roj detention camp until now, with the Australian government refusing to officially repatriate them.It is unclear why their release was halted, but Australian media has reported it may have been due to a failure to coordinate the correct permissions between the factions governing the region. Their future - and that of thousands of other IS relatives in Syria - remains unclear. Other foreign governments have also refused to repatriate their citizens.Reuters news agency quoted a co-director of Roj camp as saying that the 34 Australians had been handed over to members of their families who had travelled to Syria for their release, and had boarded minibuses to travel to Damascus with a military escort.Australian media reported that the group were intending to continue their journey to Beirut, where they hoped to be issued passports. The Australian government has repeatedly said it would not repatriate people from Syria and said those who returned who had committed crimes would be \"met with the full force of the law\".But it has previously taken the position that it is obliged to issue passports to citizens who present themselves at an Australian embassy.Roj is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities - mainly women and children - who have been held there since IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria in 2019.Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.BBC's Orla Guerin reported from Roj camp last monthSpeaking to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the camp's director, Hakmiyeh Ibrahim said: \"My message is not only to Australia but to all countries: take your citizens, take these children and women\". She added that children were growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp.\"We brought families of ISIS-affiliated women and children here in 2017 and now it's 2026,\" she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"The Australian government said in a statement: \"Our security agencies have been monitoring - and continue to monitor - the situation in Syria to ensure they are prepared for any Australians seeking to return to Australia\".\"People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law.\"The safety of Australians and the protection of Australia's national interests remain the overriding priority.\"Last month the UK home secretary said she would \"robustly defend\" the decision to remove Shamima Begum's citizenship, according to a government source.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called for an investigation, but the government source said the decision had already been upheld by UK courts.Ms Begum was 15 when she travelled from east London to the Middle East, to a territory held by the Islamic State group, where she married a fighter.",

    "body": "2 days agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersGerman Galushchenko (left) was among several figures in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government implicated in alleged corruptionA former energy minister in Ukraine has been detained while attempting to leave the country, authorities have said.German Galushchenko, who was forced out of his government role last year after being among officials named in a corruption scandal, was reportedly apprehended while on a train leaving Ukraine. It is unclear where he intended to travel to.He was one of several government figures implicated in an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scheme in November.The scandal threatened to engulf Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration, which swept to power before Russia's full-scale invasion on the promise to root out corruption.Zelensky's chief-of-staff Andriy Yermak - his closest adviser throughout the war - resigned after his home was searched. Neither the president nor Yermak have been accused of any wrongdoing.The scandal has, however, increased pressure from the US to hold elections, which have been suspended since the start of the war in 2022 due to provisions in Ukraine's constitution.The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) said in a statement on Sunday that its detectives had detained the former energy minister \"while crossing the state border\", as part of the Midas case.It did not name Galushchenko explicitly, but he has been named by several prominent Ukrainian media organisations.Galushchenko was briefly justice minister, a post he held when he was told by Zelensky to resign in November, having served as energy minister for three years prior to that. His successor, Svitlana Hrynchuk, also resigned after being implicated in the scandal.Nabu gave no further details on Galuschenko's detention, but said it would provide updates in due course.Radio Free Europe reports that he was being transported to Kyiv for further questioning, after border guards were told to alert the authorities if he attempted to flee.A massive anti-corruption probe, dubbed Operation Midas, was the culmination of 15 months of investigating, Nabu and Ukraine's other anti-corruption body, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap), said.They accused several people of orchestrating a scheme to embezzle money in Ukraine's energy sector, including at the national nuclear opertor Energoatom.Galuschenko was among those alleged to have systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.Galushchenko previously said he would defend himself against the accusations.Former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov was arrested in November on suspicion of \"illicit enrichment\", having already been charged with abuse of office. Timur Mindich, a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95, reportedly fled the country after he was flagged as a suspect. That the figures were accused of enriching themselves from Ukraine's energy sector caused particular outrage domestically, as the scandal broke as Russia stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of a bitterly cold winter.The former Soviet Union member has long been plagued by issues of corruption, which have continued despite Nabu and Sap operating for a decade.Cracking down on corruption is seen as a key requirement for Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "body": "16 hours agoLaura GozziAlexei Navalny's mother joins mourners laying flowers at son's graveThe mother of the late Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny says the assessment that her son died of poisoning has validated her belief that he was murdered.On Saturday, the UK and European allies put out a statement saying Navalny, who died in 2024, was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, and that \"only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin\".\"This confirms what we knew from the very beginning,\" Lyudmila Navalnaya said while visiting her son's grave in Moscow on Monday - the second anniversary of his death. \"We knew that our son did not simply die in prison, he was murdered.\"Russia has firmly rejected the accusations.\"Of course, we do not accept such accusations. We disagree with them, we consider them biased and unfounded. And, in fact, we resolutely reject them,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. Navalny's widow Yulia has also marked the two-year anniversary of his death, writing in a social media post: \"We have achieved truth and we will achieve justice one day too.\" The Kremlin did not comment on her statements at the time. ReutersNavalny was a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir PutinDozens of Muscovites, as well as several foreign diplomats, visited Borisovskoye cemetery on Monday, heaping flowers on Navalny's grave.A note left on the grave read: \"Alexei, we remember you every day\".Navalny was 47 when he died in the Siberian penal colony where he was serving a 19-year sentence for \"extremism\".A fierce and charismatic critic of President Vladimir Putin, he mounted campaigns highlighting high-level corruption in government, bringing hundreds of thousands onto the streets and becoming known abroad as Russia's only opposition leader.He survived a suspected poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent in 2020, for which he received treatment in a German hospital. He returned to Russia the following year, saying he did not want to \"give up either my country or my beliefs\". Police arrested him on arrival. Just over a year later, he died in the Polar Wolf penal colony above the Arctic Circle.At the time, the Kremlin said Navalny had died of natural causes. Although the authorities initially refused to release his body, he was eventually buried in Moscow in March 2024.His funeral, which was attended by thousands of mourners who defied fears of a police crackdown, was the last time like-minded Russians gathered publicly. Repression in Russia has steadily intensified over the years, ramping up following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Punitive new laws have been introduced and displays of anti-government stance – whether in the form of street protests or online posts – are routinely met with long prison sentences.Many associates of Navalny have been jailed or have fled Russia.His widow Yulia – who has since taken the helm of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation – also faces arrest, and lives abroad alongside their two children.The Russian opposition in exile is politically fragmented and has struggled to present a united front, with different factions publicly falling out.",

    "body": "'It's never too late': Savannah Guthrie's new plea for mother's release as FBI analyses glove6 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinWatch: 'It is never too late to do the right thing' Savannah Guthrie saysSavannah Guthrie has issued a plea for her 84-year-old mother's release two weeks after she disappeared in a suspected kidnapping, telling anyone involved that \"it is never too late to do the right thing\".In her latest video appeal, the US TV anchor addresses \"whoever has her, or knows where she is\" - adding that Nancy Guthrie's loved ones \"still have hope\". Currently, investigators are analysing DNA found on a glove that they recovered, which appears to match one that was worn by a suspect who appeared in doorbell-camera footage taken the night Nancy Guthrie went missing.Authorities believe the suspect in the video kidnapped Guthrie in the early hours of 1 February.The FBI said on Sunday that investigators recovered the glove from a field near the side of the road about two miles (three km) from Guthrie's home in Tucson, Arizona. The agency collected about 16 gloves from various locations near Nancy Guthrie's home, though most turned out to have been discarded by people searching for her.\"The one with the DNA profile recovered is different and appears to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video,\" the FBI said. The agency said it has received preliminary DNA test results on the glove and is still waiting for \"quality control and official confirmation\" before entering an \"unknown male profile\" into its database.NBC / Today via ReutersSavannah Guthrie with her mother NancyEarlier this week, investigators released video footage taken from a doorbell camera at Guthrie's front door that showed a masked man wearing gloves and a backpack. In the video, the suspect walks toward the camera and tries to cover it with his gloved hand before grabbing some brush from the front yard to block the camera's view. After conducting a forensic analysis of the video, the FBI announced earlier this week that it believed the man was between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall with an average build.The FBI also highlighted the backpack the suspect was wearing in the video, identifying it as a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.The clothing and face mask worn by the suspect in the video appear to have been purchased at Walmart, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told the BBC's US news partner CBS News. CBS also reported that the backpack is only sold at Walmart stores.Officials have been reviewing surveillance footage from nearby Walmart locations, Nanos said, though a corporate spokesperson declined to comment to CBS.Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homePolice have said the suspect description \"remains a key focus\", but added that \"investigators are not ruling out any individuals or possibilities\".On Monday the sheriff leading the local investigation said Guthrie's family, including all siblings and their spouses, had \"been cleared as possible suspects in this case\". Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her other daughter Annie Guthrie's house. Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.In the two weeks since Guthrie's disappearance, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Office have conducted a massive search operation involving helicopters, sniffer dogs and hundreds of officers, while taking in thousands of call-in tips. Officials have warned that her health may be at severe risk without her medication. Nanos, the local sheriff, has said she is \"not in good physical health\" but has no reported cognitive issues.Local officials have also said investigators found DNA at Guthrie's address that did not belong to her or anyone close to her.The FBI has increased the reward for information about her disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.",

    "body": "17 hours agoBasillioh RukangaNairobiReutersJomo Kenyatta International Airport acts as a hub for flights to Europe, North America and the Middle EastFlights in and out of Kenya's main airport are being delayed following a planned strike by aviation industry workers, the national airline and airports authority have said.Departing flights from Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport - one of Africa's busiest transport hubs - have been delayed by up to four hours. Some passengers say they have remained seated inside aircraft for extended periods, as pilots wait for clearance to take off.In a statement, Kenya Airways said it was experiencing \"air traffic control operational delays affecting certain departures and arrivals\". It added that it was working with authorities to minimise disruptions and maintain safe operations.The disruptions follows a warning a week ago by the Kenya Aviation Workers Union (KAWU) of a plan to go on strike over pay and poor working conditions.KAWU Secretary-General Moss Ndiema told the local Daily Nation news website that the strike had begun at 06:00 local time (03:00 GMT) affecting both passengers and airlines around the country.\"There's a big backlog. Planes are hardly leaving the airports,\" he was quoted as saying.A Kenyan senator who was travelling from the western city of Kisumu said that he had to travel by road following the strike.\"This KCAA strike is really biting! Been forced to hit the road after many hours at the airport, waiting in vain,\" Boni Khalwale said on X.\"Passengers at JKIA are currently experiencing the true meaning of patience and character development,\" another Kenyan said, adding: \"If you have a flight today just carry a mattress because you might be living at the airport.\"Aviation sector workers blame the  Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) of stalling salary negotiations, delaying union remittances and discrimination.They also accuse the authority's management of showing an unwillingness to resolve labour disputes that have persisted for more than a decade.Last week, KCAA went to court seeking orders to halt the strike. A labour court judge suspended the action pending further directions due next week.It added that \"in light of the planned strike\" it was activating measures to ensure aviation safety and service stability.The main airport in Nairobi is one of the busiest hubs in the region and serves as a key gateway between the continent and the rest of the world.  Last year, it handled about nine million passengers, according to Kenyan authorities.Additional reporting by Richard KagoeYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "21 hours agoGetty ImagesEpibatidine, which can be secreted by Anthony's poison arrow frog onto its skin, was blamed for Alexei Navalny's death by five European nationsRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a deadly toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America, the UK and some of its European allies have said.Traces of epibatidine were found in samples from Navalny's body and highly likely resulted in his death in a Siberian penal colony two years ago, the UK Foreign Office said.The allies said only the Russian state had the \"means, motive and opportunity\" to deploy this lethal toxin.The Kremlin dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\", according to Tass news agency.What is the toxin?Epibatidine is a natural neurotoxin isolated from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog, according to toxicology expert Jill Johnson.It was \"200 times more potent\" than morphine, she told BBC Russian.Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America as well as being manufactured in a laboratory.Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia, the European allies said in their statement.Species known as Anthony's poison arrow frog and the Phantasmal poison frog are among those that secrete the toxin onto their skin.Although epibatidine has been investigated as a painkiller and for relief from painful inflammatory lung conditions, it is not used clinically because of its toxicity.How does dart frog poison work?This powerful chemical compound acts on nicotinic receptors in the nervous system, according to Johnson.Because it overstimulates these nerve receptors, if dosed correctly, it can cause muscle twitching, paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and ultimately death, she explained.Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told PA that its effects can result in breathing being blocked, and that \"any person poisoned dies from suffocation\".The toxin being found in someone's blood \"suggests deliberate administration\", he added.Epibatidine toxicity can even be \"increased by co-administration of certain other drugs and these combinations have been researched\", Hay said.How rare is the toxin?Epibatidine is extremely rare and found in only one geographic region and only in trace amounts, Johnson said.It is understood the dart frog referred to by the UK Foreign Office and others was Anthony's poison arrow frog, a species endemic to Ecuador and Peru.The frogs produce the chemical through eating the right foods to produce alkaloids - a type of organic compound - that make epibatidine and accumulate it in their skin. If the frog's diet changes, its epibatidine reserves will be depleted.\"Finding a wild frog in the right place, eating exactly the food needed to produce the right alkaloids, is almost impossible... almost,\" Johnson said.\"This is an incredibly rare method of human poisoning. The only other cases of epibatidine poisoning I know of were laboratory-based and non-fatal.\"What has Russia said?European laboratories confirmed Navalny died from the obscure poison, the allies said on Saturday.Moscow has previously claimed Navalny died of natural causes, though Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya has consistently argued her husband was \"murdered\" by poisoning.The Russian embassy in London denied Moscow was involved in Navalny's death and described the announcement as \"feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists\" and \"necro-propaganda\".Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted by Russian state-run news agency Tass as saying: \"All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.\"Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former UK and Nato senior officer, who is also a chemical weapons expert, said people should take anything the Kremlin says, including about Navalny's death, \"with a pinch of salt\".He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Nato countries \"have demonstrated that they have the evidence that Navalny was murdered by the state\".At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years and had latterly been transferred to an Arctic penal colony.According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.",

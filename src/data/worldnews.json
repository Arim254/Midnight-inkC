    "body": "2 hours agoAndré Rhoden-Paul and Mallory MoenchandBBC VerifyWatch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfoldedThe US has captured Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro after a large-scale strike on the South American country, US President Donald Trump has said. Trump said Venezuela's left-wing president and his wife were flown out in a military operation carried out in conjunction with US law enforcement. They have been charged with drug and weapons offences in New York. It comes after explosions were reported across the capital Caracas in the early hours of Saturday morning, including at military bases. The Venezuelan government deployed its armed forces and declared a national emergency.Maduro's capture comes after heightened tensions between the two countries, with Washington striking boats in the Caribbean it says are being used to carry drugs. The US has accused the Venezuelan president of being personally involved in drug-smuggling and being an illegitimate leader, while Maduro has accused the US of intimidation and wanting to seize its oil.Trump during a news conference on Saturday said the US would \"run\" Venezuela \"until a safe and proper and judicious transition\", adding that American oil companies would also move into the country.Here is what we know so far. What do we know about the operation?Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force - the military's top counter terrorism unit, the BBC's US news partner CBS News reported.A CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped the US track Maduro's location in the lead-up - part of an extensive intelligence network, CBS said.Speaking alongside Trump on Saturday, Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Operation Absolute Resolve took months of planning and rehearsals, with forces waiting for the right weather.More than 150 aircraft were used to get an extraction team into the capital.The team came in and entered Maduro's compound - \"a house that was more like a fortress\", according to Trump - at 02:01 local time (06:01 GMT) - with the lights in Caracas having been turned off by the Americans.The US president said Maduro tried to get into a steel-fortified safe place, made it to the door, but was unable to close it.He added that no US forces were killed and there were \"few\" injuries in the operation, which he said he watched live.Maduro and his wife were put on a ship and then a plane, which later landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York state, around 60 miles (97km) north of Manhattan.CBS had reported they were expected to be brought to Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.Donald TrumpTrump posted a picture of Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima after his arrestAt the same time as the military operation, loud explosions were heard in Caracas, while plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. Videos of explosions and helicopters flying overhead have been circulating on social media, but they have not been verified yet. It is not known if there have been any casualties. The Venezuelan government also said the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira were hit. Trump said US forces had been \"prepared for a second wave\" but did not have to conduct one because the first was \"so powerful\".AFP via Getty ImagesFuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in CaracasWhere were the strikes?BBC Verify is working through a number of videos showing explosions, fire and smoke in locations around Caracas to identify exactly which sites were targeted. It has confirmed five locations, so far: Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, an airfield known as La CarlotaFuerte Tiuna, a key military facility in CaracasPort La Guaira, Caracas' main conduit to the Caribbean Sea, located in Miranda stateHiguerote Airport, also located in Miranda state, just east of Caracas Antenas El Volcan, a telecomms towers on Cerro El Volcan, a high peak in Miranda stateHow has Venezuela reacted?Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez on state television appealed for calm and unity, called for the release of Maduro, who she said was the \"only president\", and added that Venezuela would never be a colony of any nation. Earlier on Saturday, Trump said Rodríguez had been sworn in as president and had spoken to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and told him \"we'll do whatever you need\", Trump said. \"She really doesn't have a choice,\" Trump added.The country's defence minister Vladimir Padrino López earlier claimed the strikes hit civilian areas and said the government was compiling information about dead and injured people. He added that Venezuela would \"resist\" the presence of foreign troops.Venezuela's government issued an official statement denouncing the \"extremely serious military aggression\" by the US \"against Venezuelan territory and population in civilian and military locations\".It also accused the US of threatening international peace and stability and described the attack as an attempt to seize \"Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals\" in an attempt to \"forcibly break the political independence of the nation\".What will happen to Venezuela next? During Saturday's news conference, Trump said the US was going \"to run the country until such time as we can do a safe and proper and judicious transition\".Asked by reporters about Venezuela's opposition leader and 2025 Nobel Peace winner María Corina Machado, Trump said she did not have support or respect.Earlier on social media, Machado had said \"the hour of freedom has arrived\" and called for Edmundo González Urrutia, who according to vote tallies released by her party won the 2024 election, to assume power.Trump also said American oil companies would move in to fix infrastructure \"and start making money for the country\". He said \"we're going to be taking a tremendous amount of wealth from the ground\" which would go to people in Venezuela and to the US, adding \"we're going to get reimbursed for everything we've spent\". He also said the US would sell oil to other countries.Asked whether US troops would be deployed to Venezuela, Trump said \"we're not afraid of boots on the ground\".What has Maduro been charged with? US attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, had been indicted in the Southern District of New York. They have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the US. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi wrote on X.Who is Maduro and why has he been captured? Nicolás Maduro rose to prominence under the leadership of left-wing President Hugo Chávez and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). He succeeded Chávez as president in 2013. In 2024, Maduro was declared winner of the presidential election, even though voting tallies collected by the opposition suggested that its candidate, Edmundo González, had won by a landslide.He has been at odds with Trump over the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the US and the movement of drugs into the US, in particular fentanyl and cocaine.Trump has designated two Venezuelan drug gangs - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as Foreign Terrorist Organisations (FTOs) and has alleged that the latter was led by Maduro himself.The US had offered a $50m (£37m) reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest.Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.In recent months, US forces have also carried out more than two dozen strikes in international waters on boats it alleges have been used to traffick drugs into the US. More than 100 people have been killed.ReutersVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores have been capturedWho is Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores?First Lady Cilia Flores - who was also taken to the US and indicted alongside her husband - has held a number of senior posts in Venezuela, including attorney general and president of the national assembly. She is seen as a powerful political operator in her own right.Flores, 59, is colloquially known as Maduro's primera combatiente (first warrior), and has often been pictured at his side during public engagements.Like her husband, she was living under US sanctions - which were imposed during Trump's first presidency on the allegation that she was involved in Maduro's corrupt practices. At the time, Maduro hit back by saying: \"You don't mess with Cilia. You don't mess with family.\"Flores is a lawyer by training, and she once fought for the release from prison of Hugo Chávez, who tried to seize control of the Venezuelan government in 1992 and later went on to become the country's president. Her career became forever linked with Chávez's movement.Flores's tenure as head of the National Assembly was not without controversy, including her decision to prohibit press access to the parliamentary chamber, and accusations of nepotism.Flores's relatives have previously been targeted by the Americans on similar accusations of drugs trafficking. In 2015, two of her nephews were arrested in Haiti and convicted and imprisoned in the US on drugs charges. They were later released under a 2022 prisoner swap.How have other countries reacted?The initial news of the strikes prompted the strongest reaction from Venezuela's long-term allies.Russia accused the US of committing \"an act of armed aggression\" that was \"deeply concerning and condemnable\".China's foreign ministry said in a statement that it was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemns\" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president.Iran's foreign ministry called the strikes a \"flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty\". Venezuela's neighbours Colombia and Brazil criticised the moves. Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the strikes an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, while Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel described it as a \"criminal attack\". Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva wrote on X that the bombings and Maduro's capture \"cross an unacceptable line\", adding \"attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability\".Chile's President Gabriel Boric expressed \"concern and condemnation\" on X and called for \"a peaceful solution to the serious crisis affecting the country\".Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Cane accused the US of a \"criminal attack\".Meanwhile, Trump's ally in Argentina, Javier Milei, wrote \"Freedom moves forward\" and \"Long live freedom\" on social media.On the international stage, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is \"deeply alarmed\" by the strikes, with his spokesman saying in a statement it sets a \"dangerous precedent\".The UN chief is \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected\" and calls on all actors in Venezuela to engage in inclusive dialogue, in full respect of human rights and the rule of law\", his spokesman said.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would \"shed no tears\" about the end of Maduro's regime and would discuss the \"evolving situation\" in Venezuela with US counterparts.The EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas reiterated the bloc's position that Maduro lacks legitimacy and that there should be a peaceful transition of power, but said the principles of international law must be respected.French President Emmanuel Macron said the transition of power \"must be peaceful, democratic, and respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people\" in a post on X. He added he hoped González - the opposition's 2024 presidential candidate - could ensure the transition.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the legality of the US operation was \"complex\" and international law in general must apply. He warned that \"political instability must not be allowed to arise in Venezuela\".The office of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the government believed \"external military action is not the way to end totalitarian regimes\" but said it considered \"defensive intervention\" against hybrid attacks to be \"legitimate, as in the case of state entities that fuel and promote drug trafficking\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonGetty ImagesThe managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people and injured another 119 have been placed under criminal investigation, Swiss prosecutors have said. The French couple - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said. Eight Swiss nationals from among those killed were the first to be identified on Saturday. The likely cause of the fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana was sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation found. In a statement, Beatrice Pilloud, the lead prosecutor in the canton of Valais, said investigators were looking into whether the venue's acoustic foam was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16. A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Swiss authorities have not released the names of the eight people whose identification was completed on Saturday - all aged 16-24. Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's Ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

He led a long life and no doubt fathered many calves,\" said the Amboseli Trust for Elephants in its farewell message.Famed for his long tusks, Craig the elephant was a major attraction at the park near the Tanzanian border. In 2021, he was named an ambassador for the popular Kenyan lager brand Tusker - a name also used for adult male elephants with tusks.The Kenya Wildlife Service described Craig as an \"icon\" of successful conservation.\"Craig was one of the last remaining super tuskers in Africa - a rare class of bull elephants whose two tusks weigh over 45kg (100lb) each. Fewer than a handful remain today, making him a living monument to Africa's natural heritage.\"The wildlife body also said \"Craig was deeply loved for [his] remarkably calm nature\", often \"pausing patiently as visitors photographed and filmed him\". \"Thanks to his many protectors, he died peacefully of natural causes.\"More than two million tourists visited Kenya last year, many of them seeking out wildlife in the country's world-famous national parks.Kenya's tourism sector accounts for 10% of national GDP, officials say.AFP via Getty ImagesCraig the elephant became a brand ambassador for Tusker five years agoYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

IS - also known as Daesh - imposed jihadist rule over parts of Syria and Iraq until 2019.\"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East,\" UK Defence Secretary John Healey said.RAF aircraft have carried out patrols over Syria to \"prevent any attempted resurgence\" of IS following its defeat at the battle of Baghuz in 2019, the ministry said.\"I want to thank all the members of our armed forces involved in this operation for their professionalism and their courage,\" Healey said.\"They were among thousands of British personnel deployed over Christmas and New Year. This operation, to eliminate dangerous terrorists who threaten our way of life, shows how our armed forces are ready to step up, all year round, keeping Britain secure at home and strong abroad.\" In December, the US military carried out what it called a \"massive strike\" against IS targets in Syria, after an ambush killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter in Palmyra.The United Nations says IS still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.",

A BBC spokesperson said that while they did not generally comment on specific legal issues they were pleased to have reached an agreement in the case.Tzeela Horenstein said gunmen threw a grenade at her husband Simon during Hamas' attack on the village of Netiv HaAsara early in the morning of 7 October. The couple and their two young children only survived because their home's door twisted and jammed when the attackers tried to blow it out with explosives, she told the Jewish News, who first reported the story.She said: \"Not only did terrorists break into our home and try to murder us, but then the BBC crew entered again, this time with a camera as a weapon, without permission or consent.\"It was another intrusion into our lives. We felt that everything that was still under our control had been taken from us.\"The Jewish News reported that the corporation paid a financial settlement of £28,000 to the family. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Two people including a three-year-old child have been killed and around 28 others injured in a Russian strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A multi-storey residential apartment block was almost completely destroyed in the dual missile attack on Friday afternoon, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called \"heinous\". Russia's Defence Ministry denied reports of an attack, suggesting the blast had been caused by Ukrainian ammunition detonating.The strike comes ahead of crunch talks on a US-brokered peace plan in Kyiv on Saturday.Zelensky says around 15 countries are expected to attend the talks, along with representatives from the EU and Nato, with a US delegation joining the meeting via video link. Leaders of the so-called coalition of the willing are then set to meet in France on 6 January.Officials in Kharkiv said the bodies of a woman and a three-year-old child were found in the rubble, with preliminary information suggesting the pair may have been a mother and son. \"Unfortunately, this is how the Russians treat life and people – they continue killing, despite all efforts by the world, and especially by the United States, in the diplomatic process,\" Zelensky wrote on X.Of the 28 injured, which included a six-month-old baby, 16 have been taken to hospital. A search and rescue operation is ongoing, with more than 80 volunteers working at the scene, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that its armed forces \"neither planned nor launched attacks using missile weapons or aircraft weapons within the city of Kharkiv\".It added that footage from before the attack showed \"heavy smoke of unknown origin\", which it cited as evidence of ammunition detonated by Ukrainian armed forces.The ministry also alleged that the reports were seeking to distract attention from a New Year's Eve strike on a hotel in a Russian-held part of the southern Kherson region of Ukraine.Russia has accused Ukraine of killing at least 27 people and injuring more than 30 others in the drone strike on a New Year's party in the village of Khorly on the Black Sea.The BBC has not been able to independently verify either these claims or the number of casualties.Ukraine told the BBC it would not directly respond to sources of information such as claims from governors of occupied regions.It added that it adhered to the norms of international humanitarian law and conducted strikes exclusively against military targets.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened an investigation into the attack, while the Russian foreign ministry accused Zelensky of \"seeking to intimidate the populations of the reunited Russian regions, who have forever linked their fates with Russia through referendums\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoClaire KeenanWatch: Earthquake interrupts Mexico's president during press conferenceAt least two people have died after a powerful earthquake hit southern and central Mexico on Friday.The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the south-western state of Guerrero, which suffered moderate damage.A 50-year-old woman died in Guerrero, the state's governor Evelyn Salgado said, while Clara Brugada, Mexico City's mayor, confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man and said 12 others had been injured in the capital. Mexico is situated in one of the world's most seismically active areas, sitting at the meeting point of four tectonic plates.Late on Friday night, Brugada said power has been restored to \"98% of the failures reported\" in Mexico City.Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, she said, while 34 buildings and five homes were being inspected as a preventative measure.Damage assessments are under way in Mexico City after roads and hospitals were impacted, according to news agency Reuters, while authorities noted various landslides on highways around the Guerrero state. Mexico's seismological service had registered 420 aftershocks by midday local time (18:00 GMT).President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.  In a video capturing the moment, Sheinbaum can be heard saying \"it's shaking\" as an earthquake alert system rings in the background. She then tells the media to \"all get out calmly\". Additional footage shows buildings shaking in Mexico City and cars trembling in Acapulco.Getty ImagesThe inside of a house damaged by the quake in San Marcos, Guerrero state, MexicoAfter hearing the Mexican Seismic Alert System early on Friday, residents and tourists rushed into the streets of Mexico City and Acapulco.The seismic system was put into place following the deadly 1985 earthquake that claimed more than 10,000 lives.In 2017, a 7.1 magnitude quake killed more than 200 people and toppled dozens of buildings in Mexico City.",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" of demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

    "body": "1 day agoJaroslav LukivandVitaliy Shevchenko,Russia editor, BBC MonitoringUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has named spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as his new chief of staff, just over a month after his previous top aide resigned in a corruption row.\"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues,\" Zelensky said in a social media post, alongside a photo of his meeting with Gen Budanov in Kyiv.The 39-year-old has until now led the Hur military intelligence, which has claimed a number of highly effective strikes against Russia.Zelensky also said he intended to replace his defence minister Denys Shmyhal, appointing his current minister of digital transformation Mykhaylo Fedorov to take up the post.Budanov's predecessor, Andriy Yermak, wielded enormous political influence throughout Russia's full-scale invasion, which began in 2022. He also led Ukraine's negotiating team in crucial talks with the US aimed at ending the war.Zelensky wrote on Friday: \"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the defence and security forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations. \"Kyrylo has specialist experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results.\" The president added that he had already instructed his new office chief to update and present key documents regarding \"the strategic foundations\" of Ukraine's defence.The chief of presidential staff in Ukraine is historically a very powerful position. There was a time in the 2000s when a presidential administration head in Ukraine wielded about as much power as the president himself.Ostensibly administrative, the role traditionally offered not just close access to the head of state, but also plentiful opportunities to pull the strings of government.For example, the chief of presidential staff could lobby for government appointments and apply pressure to business circles, often resulting in personal gain.Budanov's appointment suggests an intention to overhaul the role. It puts the president's office on a war footing - it will very likely be much more focused on security and the war with Russia.Later on Friday, Zelensky announced other changes to his top team. He said Fedorov had been nominated to serve as his new defence minister because he had \"decided to change the structure of the Ukrainian ministry of defence\".Federov, aged 34, is the youngest minister in the Ukrainian government. His key achievement so far is the development and implementation of Diya, a centralised digital platform for government services.He is \"deeply involved with drones\", and will be tasked in particular with training more drone operators, Zelensky said in his evening address. He added that Shmyhal remains \"part of the team\" and will be moved to another area of work.Zelensky said Budanov was being replaced by 56-year-old foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko.Budanov's predecessor, former chief of staff Yermak, 54, stepped down on 28 November, and his departure was seen as a major blow to Zelensky.Yermak quit shortly after his home in Kyiv was raided by the country's anti-corruption agencies. He is not accused of any wrongdoing, and the anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office Sap did not explain why they searched his property. In the past few months investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position at a delicate time.Kyiv, backed by its European allies, is seeking to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Russian officials have seized on the scandal, talking up corruption claims.",

    "body": "'Living a nightmare': Families of teens missing after ski resort fire desperate for news16 hours agoAleks PhillipsSuppliedThe families of teenagers missing after a fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort are facing an agonising wait for news and appealing for information about their loved ones online.The fire in Crans-Montana was likely caused by sparklers placed on bottles of champagne that came \"too close to the ceiling\", Swiss officials said on Friday.An investigation into the fire will focus on the materials used at the site, the bar's fire safety measures, its capacity and the number of people inside at the time, Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said.Swiss authorities have said it could take days if not weeks to identify the victims of the fire, which killed 40 people and injured another 119. Officials said 113 of the injured had been identified, with authorities still working to identify the other six.In the meantime, families and friends have been taking to social media to appeal for information about their loved ones who were at the bar that night.What we know so farSparklers on champagne bottles likely cause of fireWatch as partygoers try to put out flamesCharlotte Niddam/TikTokAmong the missing is thought to be 15-year-old Charlotte Niddam, a former student at schools in the UK.The Jewish Free School in north-west London called for \"love and prayers\", saying Charlotte had been a student there for two years before her family moved back to France.\"She is loved by so many within JFS and is friends with many in our community,\" it added.A statement from Immanuel College - a private Jewish school in Hertfordshire - widely reported in the UK press said her family had \"asked that we all keep them in our thoughts and prayers during this extremely difficult time\". It added: \"We are all praying for a miracle for Charlotte and the others.\"Crans-Montana's tourism website lists her as a babysitter in the resort during school holidays.Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookSwiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, is among the missingThe whereabouts of Swiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, are currently unknown, his mother Laetitia said.\"I must find my son... it's been 30 hours since [he] disappeared,\" she told the BBC, adding that she wanted his photo \"to be everywhere so that, just in case, someone recognises him, they can call me\".Ms Brodard said that she and Arthur's father had been checking hospitals in Lausanne and Bern, but could not find him, earlier telling local newspaper Le Temps that she was \"living a nightmare.\"Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"SUPPLIEDAchille Barosi was described by his aunt as an avid painterAnother missing Italian national is Achille Osvaldo Giovanni Barosi, 16, who entered the bar at 01:30 local time on New Year's Day to retrieve his jacket and phone. His family have not heard from him since.\"We don't know if he's still alive,\" his aunt Francesca told the BBC World Service's OS programme.She described her nephew, who is enrolled in an art school in Milan, as a beautiful boy and an excellent painter.\"We just want to find him, and that's it.\"The Italian foreign ministry has said six of its citizens remain missing.Italian Golf FederationJunior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, was last heard from around midnight on New Year's Eve, according to his fatherAmong them is Emanuele Galeppini, a 16-year-old junior golfer, originally from Genoa but now living in Dubai.The Italian Golf Federation has said he is dead, without mentioning the fire, paying tribute to a \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father, Edoardo, is quoted by Italian TV channel TG24 as saying his son was at the bar and was last heard from around midnight. An Italian foreign ministry spokesperson has told the BBC that it was not confirming the death yet.Giovanni Tamburi, 16, is also among the missing. His mother, Carla Masiello, from Bologna, told La Repubblica that he had been on holiday with his father but had gone out with friends and ended up at La Constellation.\"A close friend of his told me they ran away after the fire broke out and that he had [his phone] with him, but then at a certain point he couldn't see him anymore,\" she told the newspaper, adding he had been wearing a gold chain with a small Madonna around his neck.Tania Causio, one of his teachers at his high school, told La Repubblica: \"I've always been struck by his kindness and smile, coupled with great maturity. Every time I walk into class, he asks if I want him to go get me a coffee.\"Lisa Pralong Elisabeth/FacebookFamily of Emilie Pralong face an \"agonising\" wait for information on the 22-year-oldAlso reported missing by family members is Emilie Pralong, 22, who is thought to have been at Le Constellation with several friends who may also be missing.Her grandfather, Pierre, described an \"agonising\" wait for information, telling French broadcaster BFMTV: \"We always hope - we are full of hope. It helps to overcome whatever the hardship.\"While he expressed optimism that she may turn up relatively unharmed in hospital, he said: \"We have to be ready to accept a more difficult situation.

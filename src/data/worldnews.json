    "body": "20 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersThe bus fell into a three-metre-wide ice fissure on Lake Baikal on FridayRussian authorities say divers have recovered the bodies of seven Chinese tourists and a Russian driver who died after their mini-bus plunged under the ice to the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia. Irkutsk regional Governor Igor Kobzev offered his \"deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims\". He earlier said one Chinese tourist had managed to escape. The depth at the site of Friday's accident was 18m (59ft), and the divers had to use underwater cameras to search for the bodies.Baikal - the world's deepest lake with a maximum depth of 1,642m (5,387ft) - is a popular tourist destination. It often freezes during harsh winters and has seen a number of deadly accidents over the years.The bus fell into three-metre-wide ice fissure on Friday, Kobzev said in a post on Telegram.\"I would like to remind you once again that going out onto Lake Baikal's ice is not just prohibited right now. It's mortally dangerous,\" the governor said, urging tourists to use only official tour operators.He added that all the Chinese tourists - including a 14-year-old child - had travelled independently. A criminal investigation into the cause of the tragedy is now under way.Shortly afterwards Kobzev took to social media again, saying that \"sadly, even this tragedy hasn't taught people a lesson\", informing that six people trapped in their cars had been rescued in two separate incidents on Friday and Saturday.In late January, a Chinese tourist died after a car he was travelling overturned on the frozen surface of Lake Baikal.",

    "body": "7 hours agoOttilie MitchellReutersVenezuelan Interim President Delcy Rodríguez and her brother National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez at Miraflores Palace in CaracasA total of 1,557 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty under a new law introduced on Thursday, the country's National Assembly President has said. Jorge Rodríguez, brother of Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodríguez and an ally of former President Nicolás Maduro, also said \"hundreds\" of prisoners had  already been released. Among them is politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of several opposition voices to have criticised the law for excluding certain prisoners.The US has urged Venezuela to speed up its release of political prisoners since US forces seized Maduro in a raid on 3 January. Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners.At a news conference on Saturday Jorge Rodríguez said 1,557 release requests were being addressed \"immediately\" and ultimately the legislation would extend to 11,000 prisoners.The government first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics for years. These groups have also criticised the new law. One frequently cited criticism is that it would not extend amnesty to those who called for foreign armed intervention in Venezuela, BBC Latin America specialist Luis Fajardo says.He noted that law professor Juan Carlos Apitz, of the Central University of Venezuela, told CNN Español that that part of the amnesty law \"has a name and surname\". \"That paragraph is the Maria Corina Machado paragraph.\" It is not clear if the amnesty would actually cover Machado, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, Fajardo said.He added that other controversial aspects of the law include the apparent exclusion from amnesty benefits of dozens of military officers involved in rebellions against the Maduro administration over the years.On Saturday, Rodríguez said it is \"releases from Zona Seven of El Helicoide that they're handling first\". Those jailed at the infamous prison in Caracas would be released \"over the next few hours\", he added.Activists say some family members of those imprisoned in the facility have gone on hunger strike to demand the release of their relatives.Maduro is awaiting trial in custody in the US alongside his wife Cilia Flores and has pleaded not guilty to drugs and weapons charges, saying that he is a \"prisoner of war\".",

    "body": "1 day agoReutersA major rescue operation was launched at St Anton after five skiers were caught in an avalanche some 450m wideFive people were killed in a series of avalanches in the Austrian Alps as heavy snowfall hit the region on Friday.A 42-year-old German man, caught in an avalanche with his 16-year-old son, was among the victims, police said. The teenager was airlifted to hospital from the slope in Nauders near the Swiss-Italian border.Three other skiers were killed in an avalanche near the popular St Anton resort, while a snowboarder died after being buried in the neighbouring Vorarlberg region.Austria has now seen at least 21 avalanche-related deaths this winter, while dozens of fatalities have been recorded across the Alps.The avalanche risk remains high in parts of Tyrol - meaning avalanches can be expected - where two fatal avalanches occurred on Friday in off-piste areas.Police told Austrian media the avalanche near St Anton am Arlberg, which killed three men, appeared to have been triggered by the skiers themselves.Two were American and Polish nationals, public broadcaster ORF reported, while the third was a 21-year-old Austrian who died in hospital.Two other men were recovered from the scene with injuries after a major operation involving four mountain rescue teams, three helicopters, as well as emergency services.Elsewhere, a 53-year-old man died after being crushed by a snow plough in the northern city of Linz.The vehicle slid down a set of stairs where the man had been clearing snow, ORF reported. He died at the scene.The significant snowfall in the region also caused power outages and transport chaos on Friday, particularly in the south-east.The Red Cross was deployed to help those stuck in traffic jams in the state of Styria, where a motoring organisation described the roads as \"virtually inaccessible to private vehicles\".Vienna International Airport temporarily closed in the morning, and afternoon services were \"disrupted\".The avalanche death toll in the Alps has been higher than usual this year, and includes three Britons killed in France's La Grave earlier this month.",

    "body": "15 hours agoTom BatemanState Department correspondentAmmar Awad via ReutersThe mother of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, 19, grieves at his funeral on ThursdayThe family of a 19-year-old Palestinian-American man who they say was shot dead by an Israeli settler in the occupied West Bank have called for accountability over his killing.Nasrallah Abu Siyam was shot near the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, becoming at least the sixth American citizen killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the territory in the last two years. The Trump administration said it stood ready to provide consular assistance, but did not respond to claims its policies had failed to stem a surge in settler violence.The Israeli embassy in Washington said the incident was under review and an \"operational inquiry... must be completed as soon as possible\".Abu Siyam was a US citizen born in Philadelphia.His family said he was among approximately 30 residents of the village of Mukhmas who were trying to stop armed settlers from stealing their goats on Wednesday. As both residents and settlers threw stones, said one witness, settlers shot at least three of the villagers, including Abu Siyam, who was struck fatally. Abdulhamid Siyam, cousin to Abu Siyam, told the BBC that the 19-year-old's death was a \"big loss\" and the actions of settlers in the West Bank had gone unchecked.\"A young man of 19 shot and killed in this cold blood and no responsibility, impunity completely,\" he said.The Trump administration has faced criticism from rights groups for lifting Biden-era sanctions on violent settlers, who have rarely faced criminal punishments from Israeli authorities. The US State Department said it was aware of the death of a US citizen and was \"carefully monitoring the situation\". On Saturday it released an updated statement saying it extends \"deepest condolences\" to the family of the victim and expects \"a full, thorough, and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death\". It added the US embassy in Jerusalem had been in direct contact with the family to provide assistance.A spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said that soldiers had attended the scene and used \"riot dispersal means to restore order\". \"No IDF fire  was reported during the course of the incident,\" the IDF statement said. The spokesperson confirmed that the incident was under review, and said \"a continuous military presence\" would remain in the area in the coming days to prevent further incidents.",

    "body": "15 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykEPA/ ShutterstockNasa has said that its 6 March launch day for its long-awaited lunar mission is now \"out of consideration\", after it spotted several last minute issues during routine checks that would prevent lift off. On Friday, the space agency said that its Artemis II mission, which would see astronauts sent to the moon for the first time in 50 years, would likely have the green light to launch within a matter of weeks. But NASA administrator Jared Isaacman announced on Saturday that setbacks would mean that further maintenance would have to be carried out. Four astronauts are preparing to be sent on the 10-day trip to the far side of the Moon and back, marking humanity's furthest ever journey into space. Isaacman said he understood \"that people are disappointed by this development\", after almost 50-hours of checks on Thursday revealed no faults. The agency felt almost certain that its \"wet rehearsal\" had been a success, leading the team to announce that the launch could take place as soon as 6 March. But overnight on Friday, engineers observed an interruption in the flow of helium required for launch operations.Disruption to helium, which is used to pressurise fuel tanks and cool rocket systems, is treated as a serious technical issue, according to Nasa. Nasa targets early March to send humans back around the MoonThe test was the scientists' second attempt at a practice run at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, having fixed earlier issues with filters and seals that had led to hydrogen leaks. The rocket was fuelled with around 730,000 ​gallons of propellant over several hours on Thursday, with the team stating that the simulation felt like \"a big step in us earning our right to fly\". But space missions are often fraught with setbacks, Isaacman said, highlighting that Neil Armstrong's 1966 Gemini 8 mission ended prematurely due to a technical issue, before his historic moon landing three years later. Three US astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut, Jeremy Hanse, are due to take off in the mega Moon rocket, which will allow them several hours to study the moon's surface up close. It is hoped that the mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but accepted this could be an ambitious time frame. ",

    "body": "Final missing Lake Tahoe skier found dead 5 days after avalanche 10 hours agoChristal Hayes and Nardine SaadLos Angeles, California ReutersThe ninth and final missing skier has been found dead in California's Lake Tahoe backcountry, five days after a powerful avalanche struck several guides and a tight-knit group of friends on a trip. Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said on Saturday during a news conference that all nine bodies have now been recovered from the Castle Peak area in the Sierra Nevada mountains. She also released the names of all nine victims, which included close friends, a pair of sisters and three guides. Two people who were part of the group escaped the \"football-field sized\" avalanche - the deadliest in modern California history - and authorities said they might help piece together what happened.Sheriff Moon and others during the news conference described the harsh weather rescue crews were met with after the avalanche, and that white-out conditions stalled days of searching.Authorities said there was an ongoing avalanche risk after the Tuesday disaster and high winds prevented them from being able to utilize helicopters for days.When winds calmed on Friday, helicopters were used to pour water over the area - a tactic meant to mitigate an avalanche risk - authorities said. Crews were then sent to search for the ninth missing skier.The victims were confirmed on Saturday as: Carrie Atkin, 46, of Soda Springs, California; Lizabeth Clabaugh, 52, of Boise, Idaho; Danielle Keatley, 44, of Soda Springs and Larkspur, California; Kate Morse, 45, of Soda Springs and Tiburon, California; Caroline Sekar, 45, of Soda Springs and San Francisco, California; and Katherine Vitt, 43, of Greenbrae, California.The three Blackbird Mountain guides who died were identified as Andrew Alissandratos, 34, of Verdi, Nevada; Nicole Choo, 42, of South Lake Tahoe, California, and Michael Henry, 30, from Soda Springs.Earlier this week, a family spokesperson identified several of the skiers to the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\"While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,\" Moon said at the news conference.She said they relied on avalanche experts, who said the disaster spread across the size of an American football field and was nearly powerful enough to take out a house.Six members of the 15-person backcountry ski group were rescued early this week. The group was on its way back from a three-day guided ski trip in the backcountry when the avalanche struck, bringing with it eight feet (2.4 meters) of snow and 90 mph winds.Nevada County Undersheriff Sam Brown on Thursday told CBS that when the avalanche hit, the skiers went into what he called \"frantic mode\" to try to find their friends and partners.\"They were ultimately able to unbury three individuals who did not survive,\" Brown said.The Nevada County Sheriff's Office said on Friday that authorities are investigating whether there could be criminal negligence relating to the avalanche, CBS reported.",

    "body": "1 day agoOttilie MitchellRon Galella Collection via Getty ImagesAnna Murdoch-Mann, writer and ex-wife of media baron Rupert Murdoch, has died aged 81, his media outlets have announced.Married to the media mogul for 31 years, she played an influential role on the board of his publishing giant, News Corp.She was mother to three of Murdoch's children, Elisabeth, James, and Lachlan Murdoch - who is now chairman of Fox and News Corp - and stepmother to his daughter, Prudence.Murdoch-Mann, who was also a philanthropist, died on 17 February \"surrounded by family\" at her home in Palm Beach, Florida.Born Anna Torv in Glasgow and raised as a Catholic, she moved to Australia aged nine. After her parents' divorce, she is said to have brought up her own siblings.She became a reporter for the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Daily Mirror, where she met Rupert Murdoch and went on to serve on the board of his company.\"He never made a major business decision without her input\", The Australian, another title in his media stable, writes.She penned several novels during their marriage, including the 1988 Family Business about a multi-generational media dynasty. Ron Galella Collection via Getty ImagesMurdoch-Mann in 1987 with her then-husband and sons Lachlan (far-left) and James.Muriel McKay was killed by her kidnappers and there have been renewed efforts to find her body in recent years.The then-Murdochs divorced in 1999 in one of the most expensive separations in history - Murdoch-Mann received a $1.7bn (£1bn) settlement.Murdoch married his third wife, Wendi Deng, 17 days later.In an exclusive interview after her separation, Murdoch-Mann told Australian Women's Weekly, \"I think there's going to be a lot of heartbreak and hardship\" over the succession for Murdoch's media empire.\"There's been such a lot of pressure that they needn't have had at their age,\" she added.These tensions inspired the television series Succession and played out in courts in real life too. A years-long court battle ended with Murdoch's eldest son, Lachlan, being set to control the news group late last year.Murdoch-Mann went on to remarry, first to financier William Mann, who died in 2017. She later wed her third husband, Ashton dePeyster, who survives her along with 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.The philanthropist served on the boards of several children's hospitals including in Los Angeles and Haiti. In 1998, she was made a Dame of the Order of St Gregory by Pope John Paul II.",

Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

    "body": "19 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondentEPAIsraeli air strikes have killed at least 10 people in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials say, despite a ceasefire.Israel's military said it had targeted sites belonging to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia and political party, in the Bekaa Valley, an area where the group has a strong presence.Hezbollah confirmed that at least eight of its members had been killed, including a senior field commander.The strikes were among the deadliest in Lebanon since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah in November 2024.Despite the deal, which followed 13 months of conflict, Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon, on targets it says are linked to the group, which is supported by Iran.Images posted online from one of the locations hit on Friday night showed heavy damage in what appeared to be a residential neighbourhood.In a statement, the Israeli military said it had struck what it described as Hezbollah command centres and that the group \"systematically embeds its assets within the civilian population\". It said the group's activities were \"a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon\".In a separate statement on Saturday, the military said it had \"eliminated several terrorists of Hezbollah's missile array in three different command centres... recently identified as operating to accelerate the organisation's readiness and force build-up processes, while planning fire attacks towards Israel\".Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US, says the ceasefire deal only applies to southern Lebanon, in the area between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel.The group, however, has so far rejected calls from Lebanese authorities to discuss the future of its weapons elsewhere in the country, including in the Bekaa Valley, where part of its arsenal is believed to be located.This week, Hezbollah dismissed a decision by the government to advance the second phase of the disarmament plan in areas between north of the Litani and the Awali river, in the port city of Sidon.Lebanon's government says Israel's ongoing actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam recently said the situation had become a \"one-sided war of attrition\".Hours before the attacks in the east, an Israeli strike hit the densely populated Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Helweh, on the outskirts of Sidon, in the country's south.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"command centre\" that had been used by Hamas, which said two members had been killed.The strikes come amid heightened tensions in the region, with the United States threatening to attack Iran if negotiations between the two countries fail to reach a deal.There are concerns in Lebanon that Iran might force Hezbollah to join its response to an attack if Israel becomes involved.",

    "body": "21 hours agoMaia Davies''Domenico is gone'' says mother of toddler who died after receiving damaged heartA toddler in Italy who received a damaged donor heart has died, the family's lawyer has said.Two-year-old Domenico died shortly before 09:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Saturday, Francesco Petruzzi told reporters. Monaldi Hospital, where he was being treated, said he had suffered a \"sudden and irreversible worsening of his clinical condition\".The heart given to Domenico during a transplant in late December was reportedly transported to the hospital in direct contact with dry ice, causing severe tissue damage.Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation in a case which has sparked outrage in Italy.Petruzzi has said the organ arrived \"burned by frostbite\" after being transported over 800km (490 miles) from Bolzano to Naples in an unsuitable container alongside the ice, without a thermometer to alert the medical team to the low temperature.The two-year-old had been on life support in Naples for almost two months. His mother Patrizia Mercolino had appealed to the Pope to help her son.\"It's over. Domenico is gone,\" Mercolino told reporters on Saturday.She said a foundation would be established in his name.The family's lawyer said the foundation would be for \"all children who cannot have a transplant and to help all victims of malpractice and medical negligence\".Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the \"whole of Italy mourns the loss of little Domenico, a warrior who will never be forgotten\".She wrote on X: \"On behalf of myself and the government, I offer my sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to his mother Patrizia, his father Antonio and all his loved ones.\"I am certain that the competent authorities will shed full light on this terrible incident.\"On Wednesday, a panel of paediatric specialists concluded Domenico's condition was \"not compatible\" with another transplant.Doctors had warned a prolonged use of the life support system might have compromised his lungs, liver and kidneys.Petruzzi said at the time the family wanted to see all the relevant medical records: \"If the time for hope has ended, then the time for responsibility has begun.\"Italy's Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said earlier this week that \"we must absolutely clarify what happened\".\"We owe it to the child, to the family, but also to all Italians.\"\"We have an excellent national health service, which has been able to handle and almost always resolve complex situations. So, I believe citizens should not lose faith.\"",

    "body": "59 minutes agoOttilie MitchellandYama Bariz,BBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIslamabad said the strikes were launched on Afghanistan following recent suicide bombings in PakistanPakistan has carried out multiple overnight air strikes on Afghanistan, which the Taliban has said killed at least 18 people, including women and children.Islamabad said the attacks targeted seven alleged militant camps and hideouts near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and that they had been launched after recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.Afghanistan condemned the attacks, saying they targeted multiple civilian homes and a religious school. The fresh strikes come after the two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in October following deadly cross-border clashes, though subsequent fighting has taken place.The Taliban's defence ministry said the strikes targeted civilian areas of Nangarhar and Paktika provinces and had killed dozens of people.In Girdi Kas village, in the Bihsud district of Nangarhar, a man named Shahabuddin told reporters while pointing at his destroyed house that of 23 members of his family, only five had survived the attack. Local Taliban spokesman Sayed Taib Hamd said that 18 members of the family had been killed.The BBC had earlier been told about 20 people were thought to have died. No deaths have been reported so far in the other areas hit. A guesthouse and a religious school were targeted in the Bermal and Urgun districts of Pakitka province, but they were empty at the time of the attacks, local officials and locals told the BBC.AFP via Getty ImagesHouses were also destroyed in Balish village in the Urgun district of Pakitka province (pictured)Pakistan's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said it had carried out \"intelligence based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts\".In a statement on X, it said the targets included members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, which the government refers to as \"Fitna al Khawarij,\" along with their affiliates and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province.The ministry described the strikes as \"a retributive response\" to recent suicide bombings in Pakistan by terror groups it said were sheltered by Kabul.The recent attacks in Pakistan included one on a Shia mosque in the capital Islamabad earlier this month, as well as others that took place since the holy month of Ramadan began this week in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Pakistan accused the Afghan Taliban of failing to take action against the militants, adding that it had \"conclusive evidence\" that the attacks were carried out by militants on the instructions of their leadership in Afghanistan.The Taliban's defence ministry later posted on X condemning the attacks as a \"blatant violation of Afghanistan's territorial integrity\", adding that they were a \"clear breach of international law\".It warned that \"an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time\", adding that \"attacks on civilian targets and religious institutions indicate the failure of Pakistan's army in intelligence and security.\"The strikes come days after Saudi Arabia mediated the release of three Pakistani soldiers earlier this week, who were captured in Kabul during border clashes last October.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMaia DaviesReutersMike Huckabee, pictured in September, has long been a supporter of IsraelArab and Muslim governments have condemned remarks made by the US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel would be justified in taking over a vast stretch of the Middle East on Biblical grounds.In an interview with conservative US commentator Tucker Carlson, Huckabee was asked whether Israel had a right to an area which the host said was, according to the Bible, \"essentially the entire Middle East\".The ambassador said \"it would be fine if it took it all\". But he added Israel was not seeking to do so, rather it is \"asking to at least take the land that they now occupy\" and protect its people.In a joint statement, more than a dozen governments including Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates called the comments \"dangerous and inflammatory\", and a threat to efforts to end the war in Gaza.In the interview, released on Friday, Carlson pressed the ambassador on his interpretation of a Bible verse which the host claimed suggested Israel had a right to the land between the River Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.Huckabee said \"it would be a big piece of land\" but stressed that \"I don't think that's what we're talking about here today\".He later added: \"They're not asking to go back to take all of that, but they are asking to at least take the land that they now occupy, they now live in, they now own legitimately, and it is a safe haven for them.\"He also said his earlier remark that Israel could take it \"all\" had been somewhat \"hyperbolic\".Following the interview's release, the UAE's foreign ministry released the statement  on behalf of various governments and other actors expressing \"strong condemnation and profound concern\" regarding the comments.The statement said Huckabee had \"indicated that it would be acceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the occupied West Bank\".It said the remarks violated international law and directly contradicted US President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, including efforts to create \"a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state\".The statement continued: \"The ministries reaffirmed that Israel has no sovereignty whatsoever over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands.\"\"They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states.\"The statement said it was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.Huckabee has frequently expressed his support for Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank, contradicting decades of US policy.Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in 2024.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that the court had made a \"decision of lies\" and insisted that \"the Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land\".Successive Israeli governments have allowed settlements to grow. However, expansion has risen sharply since Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the head of a right-wing, pro-settler coalition, as well as the start of the Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's deadly 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's subsequent military offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

    "body": "2 days agoBernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporterandCachella SmithGetty ImagesIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said a proposal for an agreement with the US will be ready in daysUS President Donald Trump has said he is considering a limited military strike on Iran in order to pressure its leaders to agree a deal to curb the nuclear programme.The president made the remark in response to a question from a journalist hours after officials had suggested the possibility of a strike.On Thursday, Trump said the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached or the US would take military action. The US has been increasing its military presence in the region in recent weeks.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.  US and Iranian officials have met over the issue in Switzerland and said progress has been made in the talks.Speaking on Friday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was preparing \"a draft of a possible agreement\" and would hand it over to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the next few days.The talks in Geneva were held as American forces continued ramping up their presence in the vicinity of Iran.The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is also being deployed, joining an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces.\"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" one of Khamenei's posts read.Trump takes questions from journalists several times a week - often in lengthy sessions in the Oval Office or on Air Force One - but his comments do not necessarily always translate into concrete actions, and often contradict each other.He is fond of reminding reporters that he prefers to keep his intentions to himself and a small circle of insiders to avoid potential adversaries knowing his next moves.\"I'm not going to talk to you about that,\" he snapped at a reporter on Thursday when asked about potential military action. \"We're going to make a deal or get a deal one way or the other.\"Even if an operation is carried out, Trump has so far yet to specify what the precise military objective would be, with US officials having reportedly presented him with a wide range of options for what could be a weeks-long campaign.In the past, Trump has also used deadlines to achieve an element of surprise.At the time of Operation Midnight Hammer in July last year - which saw US forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities - White House officials were still publicly discussing the possibility of successful talks.The day before US missiles and bombs struck the facility, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read a statement from Trump in which he said that because \"negotiations may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks\".Any strikes in the near future would come at a challenging time domestically for the Trump administration, with polls showing that a growing number of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration and the economy.Unlike the one-day strike in Iran last year and the quick operation to capture Nicolás Maduro in January, a protracted, multi-week conflict with Iran threatens alienating parts of Trump's Maga base which were drawn to his campaign promise of an end to messy foreign entanglements.",

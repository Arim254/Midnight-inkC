    "body": "Chen Ning Yang, Nobel laureate and one of the world's most influential physicists, has died at the age of 103, according to Chinese state media.An obituary released by CCTV cited illness as the cause of death.Yang and fellow theoretical physicist, Lee Tsung-Dao, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their work in parity laws, which led to important discoveries regarding elementary particles - the building blocks of matter. Yang was also a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and an honorary dean of the Institute for Advanced Study at the institution.Born in 1922 in China's eastern Anhui province, he was the oldest of five children and raised on the campus of Tsinghua University where his father was a professor of mathematics.As a teenager, Yang told his parents: \"One day, I want to win the Nobel Prize.\"He achieved that dream at the age of 35, when his work with Lee studying the law of parity earned them the honour in 1957.The Nobel committee praised \"their penetrating investigation... which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\".Yang received his science degree in 1942 from National Southwest Associated University in Kunming, and later completed a master's degree at Tsinghua University.At the end of the Sino-Japanese War, he travelled to the US on a fellowship from Tsinghua and studied at the University of Chicago, where he worked under Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, inventor of the world's first nuclear reactor.Throughout a prolific career, he worked across all areas of physics, but maintained particular interest in the fields of statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.Yang received the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in 1957 and was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Princeton University in 1958.Yang married his first wife Chih Li Tu in 1950, with whom he had three children.After Tu's death in 2003, Yang married his second wife Weng Fan, who is more than 50 years his junior.The pair had first met in 1995 when Weng was a student in a physics seminar, and later reconnected in 2004. At the time, Yang called her his \"final blessing from God\".",

    "body": "12 minutes agoIan AikmanBBCA large crowd gathered for the players' funeral on SaturdayAfghanistan will no longer take part in an upcoming cricket series after three players in a local tournament were killed in an air strike, the nation's cricketing body says.The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said it would withdraw from November's tri-nation T20 series out of respect for the dead, who it said were \"targeted\" in an \"attack carried out by the Pakistani regime\" on Friday. The three did not play for the national team.The strike hit a home in Urgon district in Paktika province, where the players were eating dinner after a match, witnesses and local officials told the BBC.Eight people were killed, the ACB said. Pakistan said the strike hit militants and denied targeting civilians.The ACB named the three players who were killed as Kabeer Agha, Sibghatullah and Haroon, calling their deaths \"a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family\".The International Cricket Council (ICC) said it was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" by the \"tragic deaths of three young and promising Afghan cricketers\" in an air strike that also \"claimed the lives of several civilians\".\"The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief,\" it said in a statement, adding that it \"strongly condemns this act of violence\".The attack came hours after a temporary truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan was due to expire following days of deadly clashes on the border between the two nations. Dozens of casualties have been reported.Pakistan said it had targeted Afghan militants in the air strike and that at least 70 combatants had been killed. Pakistan's Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar said claims that the attack targeted civilians are \"false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan\".Afghanistan Cricket Board/XThe Afghanistan Cricket Board shared this image of the three players who were killedIn a social media post, Afghan national team captain Rashid Khan paid tribute to the \"aspiring young cricketers who dreamed of representing their nation on the world stage\".Other players for the Afghan national side joined the tributes, including Fazalhaq Farooqi, who said the attack was a \"heinous, unforgivable crime\".On Saturday, large crowds of people were seen gathering at the funeral for the strike's victims.The strike came after Pakistani officials said seven soldiers were killed in a suicide attack near the Afghan border on Friday.The 48-hour truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which began on Wednesday at 13:00 GMT, has reportedly been extended to allow for negotiations.An Afghan delegation arrived in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday for peace talks with the Pakistani side. The Taliban government said it would take part in the talks despite \"Pakistani aggression\", which it says was Islamabad's attempt to prolong the conflict.Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Pakistan should \"reconsider its policies, and pursue friendly and civilised relations\" with Afghanistan.Pakistan's Foreign Office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif would lead the country's delegation in Doha.It said the talks will focus on ending cross-border terrorism and restoring peace and stability on the Pakistan-Afghan border.Zimbabwe will now replace Afghanistan in the T20 series.",

    "body": "No Kings protest begins in New York as millions expected at anti-Trump rallies across USA planned protest against President Donald Trump has begun in New York City, the first of more than 2,500 rallies organised coast-to-coast across the US on Saturday.Thousands have already packed Times Square for the event organised by No Kings, a coalition of left-leaning groups.Demonstrations under their banner in June attracted over five million people nationwide, and were largely peaceful.Trump allies have accused the protesters of being allied with the far-left Antifa movement, and condemned what they called \"the hate America rally\".Republican governors in several US states have placed National Guard troops on standby, but it is unclear how visible the military presence will be. Protests are expected to continue across the country throughout the day. In Washington DC, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is expected to be a keynote speaker, with events kicking off around noon local time. The protest organisers say the gathering will challenge Trump's \"authoritarianism\". \"The president thinks his rule is absolute,\" they say on their website. \"But in America, we don't have kings and we won't back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty.\"Throughout Europe, protesters have taken to the streets in Berlin, Madrid and Rome to show solidarity with their American counterparts.In an interview with Fox News, set to air on Sunday but teased on Saturday, Trump appeared to address the upcoming rallies.\"A king! This is not an act,\" Trump said in a preview clip of the interview. \"You know â€“ they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king.\"\"We'll have to get the National Guard out,\" Kansas Senator Roger Marshall said ahead of the rallies, according to CNN. \"Hopefully it'll be peaceful. I doubt it.\"Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday activated the state's National Guard ahead of a protest scheduled in Austin, the state's capital. He said the troops would be needed due to the \"planned antifa-linked demonstration\".Democrats denounced the move, including the state's top Democrat Gene Wu, who argued: \"Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do - and Greg Abbott just proved he's one of them.\"Virginia's Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin also ordered the state National Guard to be activated.Earlier this week actor Robert De Niro, a regular Trump critic, shared a short video urging Americans to join in \"non-violently raising our voices\".\"We've had two and a half centuries of democracy... often challenging, sometimes messy, always essential,\" he said.\"Now we have a would-be king who wants to take it away: King Donald the First.\"Among the celebrities expected to attend No Kings rallies are Jane Fonda, Kerry Washington, John Legend, Alan Cumming and John Leguizamo.",

    "body": "Scientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago.The male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found \"completely preserved\" during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia's far east, a new research paper says.Mursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft.Now, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died.According to the paper, the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were \"robust\" individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood.All showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips. All of the men were suffering from some kind of \"pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives\". DNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area. The paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts. The researchers believe the men were likely victims of the 'Crisis of the Third Century', most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were \"numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne\".The paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area. It notes that mass burials and mass graves were \"not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire\", and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events.Given the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were \"most probably thrown in\" the well before being covered with soil.Mursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area.",

    "body": "Shohei Ohtani delivered one of the greatest performances in baseball history as defending champions the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Milwaukee Brewers to reach the World Series.Japan's Ohtani smashed three huge home runs and struck out 10 Brewers batters in a comprehensive 5-1 victory as the Dodgers swept the series 4-0.The 31-year-old's trifecta of home runs and 10 strikeouts in the same game is a Major League Baseball post-season record, highlighting a rare talent of excelling with bat and ball. Ohtani also became the first pitcher since the Boston Braves' Jim Tobin in 1942 to hit three home runs in the same game.\"It was really fun on both sides of the ball today,\" said Ohtani, who was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his heroics.\"I'm taking this trophy and let's get four more wins. We won it as a team and this is really a team effort. I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world could enjoy a really good sake [Japanese rice wine].\"Ohtani's entered the game at the Dodger Stadium on the back of an eight-game home run drought, but led from the front as he struck out three batters in the opening frame.He then starred with the bat in a performance which included a crushing 446 foot home run and a monster 469 foot hit which bounced out of the stadium.It marked another historic showing from Ohtani, who last year became the first player ever to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.\"That was probably the greatest post-season performance of all time,\" said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. \"There's a reason why he's the greatest player on the planet. It's kind of whatever you don't expect, expect him to do it.\"This is just a performance that I've just never seen. No-one's ever seen something like this. I'm still in awe right now of Shohei.\"The Dodgers' comfortable victory sets up a World Series showdown against the Toronto Blue Jays or Seattle Mariners, with the latter 3-2 up in the best-of-seven series.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identity theft. In a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"The former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023. Santos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported. He served less than three months of a seven-year sentence.\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.In April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"He reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"Prosecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.In his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.Trump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old. \"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month. Santos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.From there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.He was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.A report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.Santos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.Earlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned. The letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"He wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions. \"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. \"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"Santos began serving his sentence in July at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey.Trump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.In May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.He also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.Commutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon.",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the bestselling memoir I Want to Die but I Want To Eat Tteokbokki has died at the age of 35.Her 2018 book, a compilation of conversations with her psychiatrist about her depression, was a cultural phenomenon with its themes of mental health resonating with readers across the world.Originally written in Korean, it found international acclaim after its English translation was published in 2022.The details surrounding her death are unclear.Baek donated her organs - her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys - which have helped to save five lives, the Korean Organ Donation Agency said in a statement on Friday.The statement also included comments from her sister, which said that Baek had wanted to \"share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope\".I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018, has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated in 25 countries.The runaway bestseller was celebrated for normalising mental health conversations and its nuanced take on inner struggles - most notably, the author's personal conflict between depressive thoughts and her appreciation for simple joys.\"The human heart, even when it wants to die, quite often wants at the same time to eat some tteokbokki, too,\" goes the book's most famous line. Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.Born in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.Anton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.For a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.A sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.Tributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"Another Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\". \"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "2 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemGaza's Hamas-run civil defence says 11 people were killed, all from the same family, after the bus they were in was hit by an Israeli tank shell in northern Gaza.The Abu Shaaban family, it said, were trying to reach their home to inspect it when the incident happened in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday night.This is the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire eight days ago.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.Israeli soldiers continue to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency the victims were members of the Abu Shaaban family and were killed while \"trying to check on their home\" in the area.The dead included women and children, according to the civil defence.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle.It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.\"Hamas said the family had been targeted without justification.The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control. With limited internet access, many Palestinians do not know the position of Israeli troops as the yellow demarcation line is not physically marked, and it is unclear if the area where the bus was travelling did cross it.The BBC has asked the IDF for coordinates of the incident.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday the army would set up visual signs to indicate the location of the line.In a separate development, Hamas on Friday released the body of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit to the Red Cross, which returned it to Israel.Mr Margalit was the tenth deceased hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people are yet to be repatriated. Israel handed the bodies of 15 more Palestinians over to officials in Gaza via the Red Cross, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the dead hostages' bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "Israel's military has confirmed that the latest remains handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza and returned to Israel are those of a dead hostage. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the returned hostage is Eliyahu Margalit, 75, who was killed on 7 October and his body taken into Gaza from Nir Oz kibbutz.Mr Margalit, who was known to his family and friends as Churchill, is the 10th dead hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people have yet to be repatriated. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Mr Margalit in a statement as \"a cowboy at heart\" who managed a cattle branch and horse stables at Nir Oz for many years.His death was announced by Israel in December 2023, a month after his daughter Nili - who was also taken hostage - was released during a temporary truce.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.On Friday night, the IDF again stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies. UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.He added that aid agencies have \"an enormous job ahead of us to stabilise the situation, to stop the starvation, to get the hospitals open, to get the kids back in school\".\"We've started to do that and we're having an impact already but being here on the ground, it's an overwhelming task,\" he said, speaking from Gaza City.BBC Verify - Aid group suspends Gaza operations after ceasefireUS plays down claims Hamas is violating ceasefire dealAs part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior Trump advisers said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing.The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe that Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Several Palestinians have been reported killed since the ceasefire came into effect. Gaza's Civil Defence, run by Hamas, said on Saturday it had recovered nine bodies all from the same family after a bus was targeted by the IDF in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, in the north, on Friday. It said 11 people were killed in total. The IDF said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle. It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement\".The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control - though the line is not clearly demarcated. The Israeli military continues to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. Under the next stages of the ceasefire, troops are expected to pull out further. Speaking about his role in brokering the ceasefire, US special envoy Steve Witkoff told CBS News's 60 Minutes programme that President Donald Trump had felt \"like the Israelis were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing\" after it targeted Hamas leaders in an air strike in Qatar in September. Following the strike in Doha, in which five lower-level Hamas members and a Qatari officer were killed, Witkoff said Trump had felt \"it was time to be very strong and stop them [Israel] from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests\".Witkoff, who led the US team at the talks alongside Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said they had felt \"a little bit betrayed\" by the Israeli move.\"We had lost the confidence of the Qataris. And so Hamas went underground, and it was very, very difficult to get to them,\" Witkoff told the US network.Qatar, a key US ally, has played an important mediating role in ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "9 hours agoBernd Debusmannat the White House andJohn SudworthKyivPresident Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have come away empty-handed from a White House meeting after US President Donald Trump indicated he was not ready to supply sought-after Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Zelensky said after the cordial bilateral talks that he and Trump had talked about long-range missiles, but decided not to make statements on the issue \"because the United States does not want an escalation\".Following the meeting, Trump took to social media to call for Kyiv and Moscow to \"stop where they are\" and end the war.The Trump-Zelensky meeting came a day after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone and agreed to meet him in Hungary soon.Zelensky believes using Tomahawks to strike at Russian oil and energy facilities would severely weaken Putin's war economy. While Trump did not rule it out, his tone at the White House on Friday was non-committal. \"Hopefully they won't need it, hopefully we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks,\" the US president said, adding: \"I think we're fairly close to that.\"He described the weapons as \"a big deal\" and said that the US needed them for its own defence. He also said that supplying Tomahawks to Ukraine could mean a further escalation in the conflict, but that discussions about sending them would continue. Asked by the BBC if the Tomahawks had prompted Putin to meet Trump, the US president said: \"The threat of that [the missiles] is good, but the threat of that is always there.\"The Ukrainian leader suggested his country could offer drones in exchange for the Tomahawks, prompting smiles and nodding from Trump.Zelensky also complimented Trump on his role in securing the first phase of a peace deal in the Middle East, suggesting the US leader could build on that momentum to help end Russia's war in Ukraine. After the meeting, Zelensky was asked by a reporter outside the White House if he thought Putin wanted a deal or was just buying time with the planned meeting with Trump in Budapest. \"I don't know,\" he said, adding that the prospect of Ukraine having Tomahawks had caused Russia to be \"afraid because it is a strong weapon\".Asked if he was leaving Washington more optimistic that Ukraine would get the Tomahawks, he said: \"I am realistic.\"The Ukrainian leader also appeared to suggest he would be amenable to Trump's suggestion of stopping the war along the current front line.\"We have to stop where we are, he is right, the president is right,\" Zelensky said. He added that the step after that would be \"to speak\". He later posted on X, saying that he had called European leaders to share details of the meeting with Trump, adding that the \"main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe.\"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the call with European leaders was \"productive\" and promised that \"the UK will continue to send humanitarian aid and military support\".While Trump had shown an openness to the idea of selling the Tomahawks in recent days, Putin warned that such a move would further strain the US-Russian relationship.On Thursday, Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks soon in Hungary - although no date has been set.Asked by a reporter on Friday if he was concerned Putin might be playing for time by agreeing to a new summit, Trump said: \"I am.\"\"But I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well. So, it's possible, a little time, it's alright. But I think that I'm pretty good at this stuff. I think that he wants to make a deal,\" he said.When asked by another reporter whether Zelensky would be involved in the prospective talks in Budapest, Trump - who was sat beside the Ukrainian president  said there was \"bad blood\" between Putin and Zelenksy. \"We want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" Trump said. \"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated.\" He added that the three leaders \"have to get together\". The US president said his call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow would meet next week.Trump had hoped a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August would help convince Putin to enter into comprehensive peace talks to end the war, but that meeting failed to produce a decisive breakthrough.They spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.Back in Ukraine, the BBC spoke on Friday to a couple repairing the small store they own in a suburb of Kyiv, after it was obliterated by Russian missiles last month.When the store-owner, Volodymyr, was asked about Trump's forthcoming summit meeting with Putin, he began to say: \"We appreciate all support\".But he stepped away as tears welled up in his eyes. After a long pause, he composed himself and started again.\"Truth and democracy will win, and all the terrorism and evil will disappear,\" he said. \"We just want to live, we don't want to give up, we just want them to leave us alone.\"",

    "body": "Five takeaways from NYC mayoral debate as Mamdani and Cuomo clash 1 day agoKayla EpsteinRockefeller Center,Grace Eliza GoodwinRockefeller Center andSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Sliwa, Mamdani and Cuomo debate grocery bills, Trump and Gaza The three leading candidates for New York City mayor took the stage at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan on Thursday to make a case to lead America's biggest city.They tangled over housing, Israel and Gaza, and President Donald Trump, with frontrunner Zohran Mamdani pressing main competitor Andrew Cuomo during the heated two-hour debate. With early voting set to begin next week, neither dominated the evening - though both declared victory afterwards. The most recent polling suggests Mamdani has widened his lead to 46%, while Cuomo stands at 33%. The outcome could have political implications beyond the Empire State as Trump looms large, and whoever wins will likely face pressure from Washington in some form.The Democratic Party nationally is likely watching to see if the America's biggest Democratic stronghold chooses an establishment, centrist figure in Cuomo - who is running as an independent - or the progressive Mamdani.Republicans also will watch to see if their candidate, Curtis Sliwa, continues to make inroads with his public safety platform.Here are five big takeaways from the night.1. Mamdani pressed on views on PalestiniansMamdani's past statements on Israel and Palestinians came up several times during the night in questions from moderators and opponents' criticisms.The candidate has stressed his support for Palestinians and statehood, and has fiercely criticised Israel's military operation in Gaza.He also was criticised by Cuomo for declining to condemn the phrase \"globalise the intifada\". Many Jews argue this slogan is an antisemitic call for violence, but pro-Palestinian activists say it refers to a call for international solidarity with Palestinians.\"Why wouldn't he condemn Hamas? Why wouldn't he condemn Hasan Piker?\" said Cuomo, referring to the left-wing political commentator and streamer, who once said \"America deserved 9/11\".In response, Mamdani said: \"I want to be very clear; the occupation is a reference to international law and the violation of it.\"And he added that the comments by Mr Piker - who he sat with for an interview on Youtube earlier this year - \"objectionable and reprehensible\". Pressed by moderators on whether he could reassure voters concerned about his past comments, Mamdani said he would seek to serve as a mayor for all New Yorkers, including its large and ideologically diverse Jewish population.But Cuomo attacked Mamdani for his views, calling the New York state assemblyman a \"divisive personality across the board\".Angelina Katsanis/Pool via REUTERS2. The fourth man: Donald TrumpThere were three candidates at tonight's debate but a fourth name kept coming up: Donald Trump.The president has implied he wants to send the National Guard into cities controlled by Democrats and has moved to withhold government funds for infrastructure projects in New York City. Trump has also prioritised the city for his mass deportation policy, and the mayor â€” who has little power over federal immigration enforcement â€” will likely have to weigh the city's response. Sliwa, the Republican, noted that the mayor would need to get along with Trump regardless of political views. But Mamdani made his opposition to the president explicit from his very first response, promising to \"take on Trump\".Cuomo, meanwhile, positioned himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the current White House, warning \"it will be Mayor Trump\" if Mamdani is elected.\"I fought Donald Trump,\" he told voters. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\"3. Affordability front and centreAs large as Trump looms, the biggest policy issue around this mayoral election is affordability. New Yorkers face high costs of living on everything - especially rent and groceries.In his opening statement, Sliwa acknowledged the \"really serious issues of affordability\" facing the city. He called for the next mayor to free up vacant apartments in NYCHA - New York's public housing programme â€” and allow people to move in.The moderators directly asked each candidate how much they paid for rent, groceries and whether they paid off credit card debt monthly. The candidates pitched a volley of proposals to tackle the cost of living, including Mamdani's plan to make buses free and Cuomo's proposal to place income limits on people who resided in rent-stabilised apartments.Cuomo criticised Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilised apartment -a form of affordable housing - even though his parents are wealthy (his mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair).Cuomo also opposed Mamdani's proposed rent freeze on stabilised apartments, saying it would only postpone future increases, force building owners into bankruptcy, and fail New Yorkers who don't live in rent-stabilised apartments.\"If you think that the problem in this city is that my rent is too low, vote for him,\" Mamdani said in response. \"If you know the problem in this city is that your rent is too high, vote for me.\"Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announces run for New York City mayorFULL COVERAGE: Mamdani, Cuomo, Sliwa debateWho is Zohran Mamdani?How Mamdani stunned New York - and what Democrats can learn from his win4. Cuomo's controversies still loomCuomo touted his decades of experience in office, rising from federal housing secretary during President Bill Clinton's administration to New York governor.However, controversies surrounding his governorship have shadowed his campaign. He resigned as governor in 2021 after an investigation by the state attorney general found he had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo apologised for acting \"in a way that made people feel uncomfortable\" but denied allegations.The New York attorney general also investigated his administration for undercounting nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, finding he understated the actual number of deaths.Mamdani attacked Cuomo on these matters, accusing him of \"sending seniors to their death in nursing homes\", and accused him of lacking integrity.Cuomo said the allegations about harming seniors in nursing homes were \"totally false\".\"During Covid, everyone did whatever they could in this state, and there have been numerous investigations where they've gone through it, and they said we followed federal guidance,\" Cuomo said. \"But yes, people died during Covid. And my heart breaks for everyone that broken, that died in this state and across this nation.\"Sliwa, too, attacked Cuomo for the \"lawsuits filed against you for sexual harassment\". The former governor rebutted that the case brought by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the misconduct claims, \"was political\".5. Curtis Sliwa makes his markSliwa held his own as the only Republican on stage. His voting bloc might be in the minority in New York City, but the 2024 presidential election revealed that residents prioritise public safety issues and Sliwa hammered that repeatedly. As the founder of the Guardian Angels, a New York City organization devoted to crime prevention, he seized the opportunity to connect with voters.The longtime New York media and political personality knew how to make himself heard. He frequently interjected, telling moderators he wanted to speak, and elbowing his way into the debate's most heated moments. From centre stage, he took swings at both opponents in equal measure.He felt confident after the debate, saying his night went \"extraordinarily well\" and likening his opponents to \"two kids in the schoolyard\".Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "9 hours agoFergus WalshMedical editorA blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis, according to a new study.Results of a trial in North America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three-quarters don't have any form of screening programme.More than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.The Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood. It is currently being trialled by the NHS.The trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year, with nearly one in 100 getting a positive result. For 62% of these cases, cancer was later confirmed.  Lead researcher Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, associate professor of radiation medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said the data showed that the test could \"fundamentally change\" their approach to cancer screening. He explained that it could help detect many types of cancer \"earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest\".The test correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.  When combined with breast, bowel, lung and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.  Crucially, three-quarters of cancers detected were those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach, bladder and pancreatic cancer.The blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in nine out of 10 cases.These impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.But scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.Clare Turnbull, professor of translational cancer genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.\"The topline results are to be released at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Berlin on Saturday, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Much will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.The NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.Sir Harpal Kumar, president of biopharma at Grail called the results \"very compelling\".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"The vast majority of people who die from cancer do so because we find their cancers too late.\"Many cancers are found when they are \"already very advanced\" he added, explaining that the aim is to \"shift to earlier detection, when we have the chance to use treatments that are much more effective and potentially curative\".But Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK cautioned that further research is needed to \"avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm\". \"The UK National Screening Committee will \"play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS,\" he added.",

    "body": "20 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent in WarsawOmar Marques/Getty ImagesVolodymyr Zhuravlyov was released after the judge delivered his verdictA Polish judge has refused to extradite a Ukrainian citizen â€“ suspected by Germany of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 â€“ arguing that if Ukraine was responsible for the attack, then it was a \"just\" act.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was brought to Warsaw District Court in handcuffs, was detained in Poland last month on a European arrest warrant.Judge Dariusz Lubowski ordered his release, after a ruling that was met with a ripple of surprise from the crowd in court and a smile from the man in the dock.Mr Zhuravlyov, along with others, is suspected of planting explosives deep beneath the Baltic Sea on the pipelines leading from Russia to Germany.Blame for the blasts, which crippled a long-controversial energy supply line from Russia to Germany, initially focused on Moscow until signs of Ukrainian involvement began to emerge. Officials in Kyiv have repeatedly denied any role.Extradition cases within the EU are usually quick and straightforward, but the Nord Stream case is proving to be very different.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose government is a key ally of war-torn Ukraine, immediately posted on X that the ruling was right. \"Case closed,\" he wrote.Diver held in Poland over Russian pipeline blasts in Baltic SeaUkrainian held in Italy over Nord Stream gas pipelines blast mysteryInside the giant district courthouse in Warsaw, Judge Lubowski announced his decision to the suspect, his family and legal team â€“ and a large cluster of TV cameras.In a long and passionate speech, he said he was considering only the request to send Mr Zhuravlyov to Germany, not the substance of the case itself. But he was clear that the context of the war in Ukraine was critical.The judge described Russia's invasion as \"a bloody and genocidal attack\" and argued, quoting Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas, that Ukraine had the legal right to defend itself.\"If Ukraine and its special forcesâ€¦ organised an armed mission to destroy enemy pipelines â€“ which the court does not prejudge â€“ then these actions were not unlawful. \"On the contrary, they were justified, rational and just,\" he told the court.BBC/Sarah RainsfordMr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, said it was important to hear the judge understood UkrainiansHe said the attack had \"deprived the enemy of billions of euros paid by Germany for the gasâ€¦ and weakened Russia's military potential\".What could be seen as terrorism or sabotage in peace time, the judge said, was different in a time of war.Germany had in fact halted use of the two Nord Stream 1 pipelines after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Nord Stream 2 had not yet entered service.Poland has always been a vocal critic of that project for making Berlin too dependent on Moscow. The route deprived Poland of transit fees for the gas. Ukraine and the US were also longstanding opponents of the pipelines.Judge Lubowski insisted, though, that his ruling was a legal one, and not emotional or political. He also questioned whether Germany had jurisdiction even to bring its case, as the explosions were in international waters on pipelines with majority Russian state ownership.Announcing that Mr Zhuravlyov would be released from custody, he said the Ukrainian would also get compensation from the Polish state.\"I am happyâ€¦ it was a really very hard three weeks,\" Mr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, told the BBC in court after the judge's verdict.\"For me, as a Ukrainian, it was very important to hear that he understands us.\"She said the family planned to stay in Poland, where they have lived since February 2022.Earlier, she described her husband's arrest at their home just outside Warsaw and said he denied any involvement in the sabotage.Volodymyr Zhuravlyov is a deep-sea diver, his wife has confirmed, but she called it a hobby and said he had no military role. He has a business in Poland installing air conditioners. Mrs Zhuravlyova could not tell the BBC exactly where her husband was when three of the four Nord Stream pipelines were blown up, because she said no-one had asked her to check.He is not the only suspect on Germany's list: another Ukrainian man was detained in Italy in August when he was on holiday. Serhiy Kuznetsov was also accused of \"unconstitutional sabotage\" and has denied any connection to the blasts. He is currently in a high security prison in northern Italy.A court in Bologna did rule he should be extradited to Berlin but earlier this week that verdict was annulled by the top appeals court in Rome and the case has been returned to Bologna to begin all over again.Asked about the decision, Germany's foreign minister said he respected the ruling and it was not the job of government to interfere with the courts.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorGAVRIIL GRIGOROV/POOL/AFPPutin flew to Alaska in his specially modified Il-96 plane in AugustThe summit has not been set in stone, but if Russia's Vladimir Putin does go to Budapest to meet US President Trump in the next two weeks, he would need to clear a few hurdles first.When Putin travelled to Alaska for his Anchorage summit in August, the US granted special permission for the presidential plane - a modified Ilyushin Il-96 airliner dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\" that has four engines and is bristling with defence systems.Russian planes are banned from US airspace, and from EU airspace too. So if Putin does fly to Budapest he would need special dispensation if he decided to fly over an EU member state.It is perfectly possible, but landlocked Hungary is not the easiest destination to get to for a Russian president who rarely sets foot abroad and has not travelled to the EU for years.\"For now, of course, it's not clear,\" says Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"What we do have is the willingness of the presidents to hold such a meeting.\"Days after Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU froze the assets of both its leader and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.A blanket ban was also imposed on all Russian aircraft flying through the airspace of all 27 EU countries. Hungary and many of its neighbours are Nato member states too.Putin has also been accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of war crimes of unlawfully deporting and transferring of Ukrainian children to Russia.So there are complications, although Hungary believes they can all be sorted out. Hungary is in the process of pulling out of the ICC anyway.Putin and Hungary's Viktor Orban, probably his closest ally in the EU, have already discussed the planned summit over the phone, and Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has told reporters \"we will of course ensure that he can enter Hungary, hold successful talks here, and then return home\".Getty ImagesHungary's Viktor Orban is one of Putin's closest allies in the EUThe EU is unlikely to create obstacles either.Its executive commission has said any meeting that moves forward \"a just and lasting peace for Ukraine\" is welcome and it supports President Trump's efforts towards that.One of the main drivers for its latest proposed sanctions on Russia - the 19th package so far - is to bring the Russians to the negotiating table, it says. And it points out there's no travel ban on Putin, only an asset freeze.The biggest sticking point is how Russia's leader will fly from Moscow to Budapest. Clearly he will not be buying an Air Serbia ticket to Belgrade and catching the train to Hungary, which may be the most direct route to take.He will want his Il-96 plane to guarantee his safety, but that will probably mean using the airspace of an EU and Nato member state and obtaining permission to break the EU's ban on Russian planes.European Commission spokeswoman Anitta Hipper said on Friday that \"in terms of the direction of travel, member states can give derogations but it must be given by member states individually\".Nato has also referred the issue to respective national authorities, and as Trump is involved they may acquiesce.Even with dispensation, a look at the map shows Putin may have to take a circuitous route. Ukraine is out of the question, and probably Poland too because of Warsaw's icy relations with Moscow.Perhaps the most direct route goes via the eastern coast of the Black Sea and Turkey, through Bulgaria and either Serbia or Romania into Hungary.Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, knows Putin well and Air Serbia has direct flights to Moscow over EU airspace. Serbia is a candidate to join the EU but is not a member.It is the EU countries, Bulgaria or perhaps Romania, that would need to give consent, and they would have to escort Putin's plane through their airspace.Romania has what is set to become the biggest Nato base in Europe, and Bulgaria is also building a Nato base as part of efforts to shore up the defensive alliance's eastern flank.A spokesperson in Bucharest told the BBC the issues were only subjects of speculation at the moment and that \"Romania has not received a request for overflight from the Russian Federation to date\".The BBC has also approached Bulgariaâ€˜s foreign ministry for comment.If Putin wants to play it even more safely, he could fly via Turkey, around the south coast of Greece and then up through Montenegrin airspace before going over Serbia. But it is a far longer route.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPutin's Ilyushin plane has been dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\"Budapest is not then the easiest of venues, even if it works very well for Viktor Orban, who has long had good relations with both Putin and Donald Trump.\"It's a leader that we like,\" said Trump on Friday, \"he likes him, I like him.\"A high-profile international summit will do Orban no harm at all, as he is trailing in the polls before elections next spring.Within hours of Budapest being named as a venue, Orban was on the phone to Putin and declared on his Facebook page: \"Preparations are in full swing!\"Orban has little time for the EU's backing of Ukraine and he was quick to make clear Brussels would have nothing to do with the talks.\"Since the EU is pro-war, it is logical that it will be left out of this peace process,\" he told Hungarian radio on Friday.European leaders will have other ideas when they see him at next week's summit in Brussels next week.",

    "body": "Donald Trump is the \"only one who can force\" Russian leader Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table over the war in Ukraine, Finland's president has told the BBC.Alexander Stubb also said that Finland would never recognise occupied Crimea as part of Russia, and that he wanted to ensure Ukraine became an EU and hopefully Nato member once the war was over.BBC Radio 4's Today programme spoke to President Stubb ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday, where he told the US president: \"I think we can end this war with your help.\"Meanwhile, Trump said that Putin has agreed to meet face-to-face with him in Hungary.The US leader said on Friday that Putin \"wants to get it ended. I think that President Zelensky wants to get it ended. Now we have to get it done\".Zelensky said in the White House that Ukraine was ready to talk in any format and wanted peace, but argued that Putin needed to be \"pressured\" into ending the war.In August, Trump and Putin met in Alaska for a summit that did not result in a breakthrough, or yield a further meeting involving Zelensky.Stubb said Trump had once asked him - over a game of golf - whether he could trust Putin; and Stubb's answer was no. \"What we need is not so much the power of the carrot to convince Russia to the negotiating table, it's more of the stick that will bring them. \"So you have to force Russia to come to the negotiating table for peace and that's the deal President Trump is trying to make.\"He said Trump \"has been giving the carrot to President Putin, and the carrot was in Alaska, and of course now if you look at the language that he has put forward lately, there has been more stick\".Stubb was optimistic about Trump's ability, saying he believed peace negotiations had probably advanced more in the past eight months during Trump's second term than in the previous three years.In maps: The war-ravaged Ukrainian territoriesRussia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Stubb said Finland would never recognise Crimea, or the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk, as Russian. Russia controls 70% of Donetsk and nearly all of neighbouring Luhansk.He said \"the only ones who can decide on the land issue are the Ukrainians themselves\".\"I want to make sure that Ukraine, when this war is over, retains its independence, retains its sovereignty - in other words becomes an EU member state and hopefully a Nato member - and also maintains its territorial integrity. That is what we are all fighting for right now,\" Stubb said.Trump said in August that there would be \"no going into Nato by Ukraine\" as part of a peace deal.The US president previously floated the idea that there may be some \"land swaps\" in a future peace deal, but then, in September, said Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\".When asked why Trump had apparently changed his tune, Stubb said it was because Russia was not advancing - seizing only 1% of Ukrainian territory in the past 1,000 days. Ukraine had also been able to push back, he said.Trump is 'the only one who can force' Putin to negotiating table, Finland's president tells BBCStubb said Russia's economy - smaller than Italy's - was suffering, with the country's reserves depleted, growth \"pretty much around zero\", and inflation raised to between 10% and 20%.Stubb said economic threats should be used to bring Russia to the table, most importantly giving â‚¬200bn (Â£173bn) worth of frozen Russian assets to Ukraine as a loan that would stay there if Russia did not pay compensation after peace negotiations.He also wanted to see exports of Russian oil and gas to Europe - which have dropped by 80% - cut off. Sanctions could be put on countries that buy Russian oil and gas, he said, in addition to the 19th European sanctions package targeting Russia.Stubb said \"all the strategic games of Putin have been an utter failure\". Russia had been unsuccessful in trying to take over Ukraine, to divide Europe and to split Nato, with two new members - Finland and Sweden - added instead.He said Europe's \"coalition of the willing\" was ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, with the key help in the air, on the seas and with intelligence.But they needed a backstop from the US, specifically in air defences, intelligence and operations, he said.Stubb said he hoped to see some results from a two-phase peace process - the first a ceasefire to stop the killing and the second an extended peace process - \"in coming days and weeks\". \"We'll keep on working at it. The key is to engage and try to find solutions and be pragmatic. In foreign policy you always have to deal with the world as it is, not what you would wish it to be, but let's do peace.\"",

    "body": "An alert sent on Thursday warning of a strong earthquake in northern Nevada was issued in error, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).At 08:06 local time, the USGS reported that a magnitude 5.9 earthquake had struck near Carson City, the state capital. The alert reached people nearly 200 miles away in the San Francisco Bay Area, triggering automatic warnings advising residents to drop for cover.However, the agency then cancelled the alert minutes later and removed the corresponding entry from its website.\"There was no M5.9 earthquake near Carson City, NV,\" the USGS said on X.The USGS said the alert originated from its automatic earthquake detection system, which had erroneously generated the report. It said it was believed to be the first time the agency has issued a completely false earthquake notification.An investigation is under way to determine what caused the malfunction.Multiple law enforcement agencies in cities and counties near the reported epicentre confirmed the absence of any ground movement.A magnitude 5.9 earthquake is typically strong enough to cause noticeable shaking and slight property damage, according to the Michigan Tech Earthquake Magnitude Scale.",

    "body": "The man accused of assassinating former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has apologised to the ex-leader's family for the first time.Tetsuya Yamagami, who earlier pleaded guilty to murder, told the court on Thursday that he felt \"deeply sorry\" towards Abe's widow, Akie.Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. He died in the hospital on the same day.Abe's death sent shockwaves around the world. He was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\".\"I have caused [the family] three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse,\" Yamagami told the court on Thursday, according to local media.He reportedly told investigators he attacked Abe because he blamed the ex-prime minister for allegedly promoting the Unification Church, which Yamagami said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.Yamagami's allegations prompted investigations into the Unification Church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings.In March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the church to disband - a ruling that the church said it would \"fight to the end\".The Unification Church has drawn controversy even before Abe's assassination, for teaching that marriage is central to spiritual salvation.Abe's grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was also Japan's prime minister, was known to have been close to the Unification Church because of its anti-communist nature. Abe himself had spoken at events related to the group.During a hearing last month, prosecutors read out a statement from Abe's widow in which she wrote: \"The sorrow of losing a husband will not be relieved.\"",

    "body": "9 minutes agoBrandon DrenonWashington DC The US Supreme court has agreed to hear a case on whether the century-old constitutional right of guaranteed citizenship for those born in the US will remain. On his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump signed an order to end birthright citizenship, but the move was blocked by lower courts after it was challenged over its constitutionality.The Supreme Court's eventual ruling will either back citizenship rights for the children of migrants who are in the US illegally or on temporary visas, or end it. Next, the justices will schedule a date to hear oral arguments between the government and plaintiffs which include immigrant parents and their infants.For nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces.The language of the amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"Trump's executive order sought to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or are in the country on temporary visas.The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.After legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal  court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.",

    "body": "India's travel chaos has worsened after the country's largest airline IndiGo cancelled hundreds of scheduled flights on Friday after three days of widespread disruption across its network.The carrier, which has a 60% market share in India and flies more than 2,000 flights a day, has been facing pilot shortages after it failed to adapt to new crew rostering rules.Thousands of passengers are stranded across India in what's a busy travel season, with all IndiGo flights from the capital Delhi cancelled.IndiGo has said operations will return to full normalcy only by 10 February, and has sought temporary relief on the new rules that call for more rest hours and restricted night-duty.The airline has also said it will reduce its flight operations to minimise disruptions from 8 December. The government has said it is closely monitoring the situation with the federal aviation minister expressing \"clear displeasure\" with how the airline had handled the situation. In a separate statement, India's aviation regulator said the disruptions were primarily on account of \"misjudgment and planning gaps\" in implementing the new flight duty time limitation rules. The regulator has directed IndiGo to submit a detailed plan on crew recruitment,  training, roster restructuring, safety-risk assessments and other mitigation measures with immediate effect.Local media reports say IndiGo has been granted a waiver from the new pilot rest rules, and the ban on combining pilot leave with weekly rest has been eased to stabilise operations. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this.But the airline has attracted sharp criticism from the Airline Pilots Association of India, which said any relief granted to the airline on duty timings undermines the spirit of the new regulations and \"gravely\" compromises the safety of the flying public. Under the new rules pilots are given more rest, with one of the major changes mandating pilots to make two night-time landings per week, down from six under the old rules.December is a busy travel month in India, when school holidays and the peak wedding season gets under way. IndiGo has said it will waive off all cancellation/reschedule requests for travel between 5 and 15 December. It is also arranging for hotel rooms and food for passengers whose travel has been disrupted. But several passengers have taken to social media, expressing anger about not being given up-to-date information and remaining stranded at the airport without food. Singapore's High Commissioner to India Simon Wong said he was \"lost for words\" as he joined the thousands stranded at the airport, having to miss the wedding of his young staff member. Major airports in Delhi, Mumbai and other cities have issued advisories asking passengers to check the status of their flights before heading to the airport. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoVikas Pandey,DelhiandRuth ComerfordRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide \"uninterrupted shipments\" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil.Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow.President Donald Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on most Indian products, arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies.Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a \"peaceful solution\" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas or Russia would seize it.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on \"the side of peace\", welcoming efforts to find a \"lasting\" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the \"connectivity\" of Russia and India was a \"major priority\" for India.In recent months, India-US ties have hit an all-time low as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable\" at the time.  In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US.\"The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,\" he asked.Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, Bloomberg reported in September - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May.  The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture.Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia.Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said.No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals.India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry.Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years.Modi said that \"energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership\", but made no specific reference to oil.India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions.Putin also referenced a \"flagship project\": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with.In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being \"reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms\".Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a \"more just\" and \"multi-polar\" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations.",

    "body": "17 hours agoAdrienne MurrayCopenhagenThe parliament of the Faroe Islands voted on Thursday to legalise abortion until the end of the 12th week of pregnancy, overturning a decades-old law that prohibited abortions in most cases.Previous legislation allowed abortions only in certain circumstances - such as rape, incest or risk to the health of the pregnant woman - and meant the self-governing Danish territory had among the most restrictive abortion policies in Europe. Following a heated parliamentary debate, the decision came down to the wire, with MPs narrowly voting in favour of the reform, by 17 to 16.\"This is truly an historic day in the Faroe Islands,\" said Ingilín Didriksen Strømm, one of the four MPs who tabled the bill.Strømm told the BBC: \"This change finally affirms women's autonomy over their own bodies in the Faroe Islands.\"\"It guarantees access to safe healthcare, and it also protects our freedom to make decisions about our own lives without fear, without stigma and without criminalisation,\" she added.The new legislation in the Faroe Islands - located between Scotland and Norway - is expected to come into effect on 1 July next year, replacing laws dating back to 1956.Under that legislation, abortions could only be performed in special circumstances - which also included if there are severe fetal health problems or if the woman is deemed \"unfit\" to care for the child.Whether a woman is \"unfit\" or not is judged first by a GP, and then a second medical body, before an abortion is granted. Both the woman and the doctor risked imprisonment if the conditions were not met.Faroese pro-choice campaigners have argued the legislation was outdated and impinged on women's rights.\"This is a colossal change,\" Bjørt Lind from pro-choice campaign group Fritt Val told Danish newspaper Politiken.\"Abortion has been so hidden and taboo in Faroese society. When we started our work, no one dared to talk about it. It has gotten much better,\" she says. \"But it's still a huge challenge.\"In a statement to the BBC, Amnesty International's Faroe Islands branch said: \"After years of campaigning we finally have a law respecting women's and all pregnant people's rights to a safe and legal abortion until week 12.\"\"This is a huge step for human rights, the right to bodily autonomy and to secure safe abortions,\"  it added. \"And Faroese women don't have to go on an expensive trip abroad to have an abortion.\"With limited access to abortions in the Faroe Islands, campaign groups said women often had to travel to Denmark for the procedure.Danish law has allowed abortion up to 12 weeks since 1973, and in June this year, that was amended to extend terminations on request until 18 weeks.According to the Centre for Reproductive Rights, some 43 countries in Europe allow \"abortion on request\" during the early stages of pregnancy. Only five - Andorra, Malta, Liechtenstein, Poland and Monaco - maintain highly restrictive laws.Those opposed to the law change in the Faroe Islands, argued that the right of the fetus should be protected. Erhard Joensen, an MP who voted against Thursday's bill, told Danish national broadcaster, DR, that he respects the result, but does not believe there is much support for the new law. \"I think we will see that some will try to roll it back,\" he said.The remote archipelago is home to around 56,000 people, who speak Faroese and have a distinct cultural identity. Compared to other Nordic countries, society in the Faroe Islands is considered relatively conservative, with more than three quarters of the population members of the Lutheran church.Previous attempts to liberalise abortion laws have failed. Most recently, in May last year, an almost identical bill resulted in a tied vote, failing to secure the majority required to pass the Faroese parliament.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAnbarasan EthirajanGlobal affairs reporterGetty ImagesFile picture of a Royal Bengal tiger in Assam State ZooA woman accused of being one of the world's most wanted traffickers of tiger body parts has been arrested in India, officials have said. Yangchen Lachungpa, who was detained earlier this week, is accused of playing a critical role in building trafficking corridors leading out of the country to smuggle  tiger parts out of the country. Lachungpa had been on Interpol's most-wanted list, and her bail plea was rejected during a court appearance on Thursday. Wildlife officials said that Ms Yangchen's arrest was a major breakthrough in the battle against poaching in India. It is rare for a woman to be arrested in connection with the illegal trade of animal body parts. Police had been looking for Lachungpa for several years. She was arrested following a co-ordinated operation between the Madhya Pradesh State Tiger Strike Force and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, the environment ministry said on Friday.  It added that Lachungpa was a key member of an organised trafficking network which has links to Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan, as well having operations in several Indian cities including Delhi.Lachungpa had been arrested in 2017but disappeared after being granted bail.Another man accused at the time, Jai Tamang, and who was arrested in 2015, told police that he had given Lachungpa wildlife contraband in exchange for shelter. Tiger parts are in demand in China where they have been used in traditional medicine.The International Fund for Animal Welfare says that there were 26 documented cases of tiger poaching in 2024, with 56 cases the proceeding year. But it adds that there were likely \"many more\" tigers were likely poached as many are found dead without evidence of poaching. ",

    "body": "Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has voted to introduce voluntary military service, in a move aimed at boosting national defences after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It marks a significant shift in Germany's approach to its military and follows Chancellor Friedrich Merz's push to create Europe's strongest conventional army.The change means that all 18-year-olds in Germany will be sent a questionnaire from January 2026 asking if they are interested and willing to join the armed forces. The form will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.Students at schools across Germany have said they will join strikes in as many as 90  cities on Friday to protest against the move.Many young Germans either oppose the new law or are sceptical.\"We don't want to spend half a year of our lives locked up in barracks, being trained in drill and obedience and learning to kill,\" the organisers of the protests wrote in a statement posted on social media.\"War offers no prospects for the future and destroys our livelihoods.\"In Hamburg alone, about 1,500 people were expected to join the protests, and school head teachers warned parents not to take their children out of school for the day.German MPs voted by 323 votes to 272 to back the change, making their country the latest European country to launch some form of revised military service. Last month, France said it was introducing 10 months of voluntary military training for 18- and 19-year-olds.The government says military service will be voluntary for as long as possible, but from July 2027, all 18-year-old men will have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for possible military service.Universal medical examinations were necessary, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said, so that in the event of an attack, Germany would not waste time determining \"who is operationally capable as a homeland protector and who is not\".Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, currently have around 182,000 service personnel, and Pistorius wants to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year.The long-term aim is to raise the number by the early 2030s to 260,000, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists, to meet new Nato force targets and strengthen Germany's defences.While the plan is for voluntary service, if the security situation worsens or if too few volunteers came forward, a form of compulsory military service could be considered by the Bundestag.If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Like other European countries, Germany ran down its armed forces during the peacetime years of the 1990s. During the Cold War it had an army of almost half a million.Compulsory military service in Germany was ended in 2011 under former chancellor Angela Merkel.But now, in the face of perceived threats from Russia and heavy pressure from Germany's traditional ally, the US, Friedrich Merz has pledged to rebuild the Bundeswehr into Europe's strongest conventional army.Nato countries have come under pressure from US President Donald Trump's White House to increase their spending on defence.Incentives for voluntary service are relatively high, with a promised salary of about €2,600 a month. In France, volunteers will be paid at least €800 (£700) a month.The Bundestag was also set to vote on Friday on a contentious pensions reform bill, which will keep the state pension at current levels until 2031.The bill is a key pillar of the coalition deal between Merz's conservatives and his centre-left partner, the Social Democrats, who have just a slender governing majority of just 12 votes.However, there had been doubts about whether it would pass the parliamentary vote, as  younger members of Merz's conservatives threatened to rebel. They say the plan is financially unsustainable and will leave younger generations shouldering the burden.But Germany's opposition far-left Left party said it would abstain from voting, which means the coalition needs fewer votes to pass it and so won't have to worry about potential rebels from its own ranks.A government crisis may narrowly have been averted.",

    "description": "Kenya has signed a historic five-year health agreement with the US, the first such pact since Donald Trump's administration overhauled its foreign aid",
    "body": "Kenya has signed a historic five-year health agreement with the US, the first such pact since Donald Trump's administration overhauled its foreign aid programme.The $2.5bn (£1.9bn) deal is aimed at combating infectious diseases in Kenya, with similar agreements expected to be rolled out in other African countries aligned with Trump's broader foreign policy goals.The government-to-government deal aims to boost transparency and accountability but has raised fears it could give the US real-time access to critical health databases, including sensitive patient information.Kenya's Health Minister Aden Duale sought to allay such fears, saying \"only de-identified, aggregated data\" would be shared.On his first day in office in January, Trump announced a freeze on foreign aid as part of a government spending review, dismantled the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and cut billions in aid to poorer countries. This has led to a drastic reduction in the availability of some drugs in developing countries.In September, the Trump administration introduced an \"America First Global Health Strategy\", making aid dependent on negotiations that officials said would cut waste and advance US priorities.Under the deal with Kenya, the US will contribute $1.7bn, with the Kenyan government covering $850m and gradually taking on more responsibility.The deal targets the prevention and treatment of HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis, maternal care, polio eradication and infectious disease outbreak response and preparedness.Signing the agreement with Kenya's President William Ruto, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described it as a \"landmark agreement,\" and referred to Kenya as a \"longstanding American ally\".He praised Kenya for its role in leading and contributing to the UN-backed mission working to combat powerful gangs in Haiti.\"If we had five or 10 countries willing to step forward and do just half of what Kenya has done already, it would be an extraordinary achievement,\" said Rubio. The secretary of state explained that the US wanted its foreign aid to go directly to governments, rather than through aid agencies and charities.\"We are not going to spend billions of dollars funding the NGO industrial complex while close and important partners like Kenya either have no role to play or have very little influence over how health care money is being spent,\" he said.Kenya's president said the money would be used to work towards the country's priorities, such as buying modern equipment for hospitals and boosting the health workforce.\"I assure you that every shilling and every dollar will be spent efficiently, effectively, and accountably,\" Ruto added. However, some Kenyans are demanding the disclosure of the full agreement, with fears that it would allow the US to view personal medical records such as the HIV status, TB treatment history, and vaccination data of Kenyan patients. \"What specific data categories are being shared? Are genomic data, disease patterns, mental health data, insurance claims, hospital records, or biometrics included? If not, why is that not explicitly written?\" lawyer Willis Otieno posted on X. Well-known whistle-blower Nelson Amenya voiced similar concerns, urging the Kenyan government to release the full agreement so \"we can read it for ourselves\".Minister Duale has dismissed such fears, insisting that Kenya's health data remained secure and fully protected by Kenyan laws.\"Your health data is a national strategic asset,\" Duale added. US officials are yet to comment on the data concerns.A number of other African countries are expected to sign similar agreements by the end of the year, according to US officials. ",

    "body": "6 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesNetflix has agreed to buy the film and streaming businesses of Warner Bros Discovery for $72bn (£54bn) in a major Hollywood deal.The streaming giant emerged as the successful bidder for Warner Bros ahead of rivals Comcast and Paramount Skydance after a drawn-out battle.Warner Bros owns franchises including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, and the streaming service HBO Max.The takeover is set to create a new giant in the entertainment industry, but the deal will still have to be approved by competition authorities.Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the streamer was \"highly confident\" it would receive the regulatory approval it needs and it was running \"full speed\" towards this. He said that by combining the library of Warner Bros shows and movies with the streaming platform's series such as Stranger Things, \"we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling\".\"Warner Bros have defined the last century of entertainment, and together we can define the next one,\" he said.Asked whether HBO should remain a separate streaming service, co-chief executive Greg Peters said Netflix believed the HBO brand was important for consumers, but added: \"We think it's quite early to get into the specifics of how we're going to tailor this offering for consumers.\"Netflix estimates it will find $2bn to $3bn in savings, mostly through eliminating overlaps in the support and technology areas of the businesses.Films made by Warner Bros will continue to be launched in cinemas, it said, and Warner Bros television studio will continue to be able to produce for third parties. Netflix will keep producing content exclusively for its own platform.Murray Close/Getty ImagesWarner Bros owns the rights to the Harry Potter filmsLabelling it a \"big day\" for the companies, Mr Sarandos acknowledged the acquisition may have surprised some shareholders but it was a \"rare opportunity\" to set Netflix up for success \"for decades to come\".David Zaslav, president and chief executive of Warner Bros, added the agreement would combine \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world\".\"By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come,\" he said.The cash and stock deal is worth $27.75 per Warner Bros share, with a total enterprise value - which includes the company's debts and the value of its shares - of about $82.7bn. The equity value, or cash price, is $72bn.The boards of directors from each company unanimously approved the deal.Michael O'Leary, chief executive of trade organisation Cinema United, said the merger posed \"an unprecedented threat\" to the global  cinema business.\"The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,\" he said.Netflix will complete the takeover after Warner Bros finalises its previously announced plans to separate its streaming and studios division from its global networks division into two companies next year.Its global networks division will become Discovery Global and will include its cable channels such as CNN and TNT Sports in the US, as well as its Discovery and free-to-air channels in Europe. However, TNT Sports International will stay with the streaming and studios division being sold to Netflix.Hollywood shake-upPaolo Pescatore, founder and technology media and telecom analyst at PP Foresight, said the sale was \"a huge statement of intent and underlines Netflix aspirations to be a global leader in the new world order of streaming\".But he warned that while the \"surprising move\" made sense for Warner Bros, it could \"provide a headache for Netflix\" when trying to combine the companies given the size of the deal.While the agreed deal is for part of the Warner Bros business, rival Paramount had tabled a bid to buy the whole company, including its cable networks, in October. Warner Bros rejected this move before putting itself up for sale.Ahead of the announcement of the deal, Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the takeover would be approved by regulators, but if it went through it would have a massive impact on cinema.\"Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood,\" he said.Mr Harrington said there was likely to be \"big reductions\" in television and film output from a newly-merged company, which would lead to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant unions.For consumers, Mr Harrington said a merger was likely to lead to higher prices.\"Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be shuttered/become non-essential, the greater penetration of Netflix households would likely mean an increase in total overall subscription revenues.\"Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Netflix had \"offered an olive branch\" to Hollywood with the promise it would continue to release Warner Bros films on the big screen.\"If this deal can clear those significant regulatory hurdles quickly there are likely to be considerable cost savings to be made,\" she said. \"How much of those savings get passed to streaming platform subscribers or whether Netflix will be seen to have too much pricing power is one of the areas that will face a huge amount of scrutiny in the coming months.\"With additional reporting by Natalie Sherman",

    "body": "Western embassies in Tanzania, including the UK and France, have called on the authorities to release to the families all bodies of those killed in October's electoral violence.Citing \"credible reports\", the 17 missions said there was \"evidence of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests\" and the \"concealment of bodies\" by Tanzanian authorities during the unrest.In response, Tanzania said it had set up a commission of inquiry which would bring about an understanding of the \"unfortunate events\".Hundreds are reported to have been killed in the violence, though the government has not released an official toll.The authorities violently cracked down on widespread demonstrations after the 29 October presidential election, in which President Samia Suluhu Hassan was declared the winner with nearly 98% of the vote. Samia's main rivals were barred, prompting widespread anger over the fairness of the presidential contest, which the opposition denounced as a \"mockery of democracy\".The authorities also imposed an internet blackout and threatened anyone sharing photos from the protests.Samia has defended the fairness of the election and rejected criticism of her human rights record.At least 240 people were charged with treason after the protests, but the president later sought to ease tension and asked prosecutors to \"show leniency\". Many of those charged have reportedly already been released.Opposition leader Tundu Lissu was charged with treason in April and remains behind bars.In a joint statement on Friday, the coalition of Western embassies in Tanzania urged the government to free political prisoners and allow detainees to get legal and medical help.\"We call on the authorities to urgently release all the bodies of the dead to their families,\" added the statement issued by the European Union delegation, several EU member countries, Canada, Norway and Switzerland. They welcomed the government's decision to investigate the causes and circumstances of the violence but stressed that the probe be independent, transparent, and inclusive, involving civil society, faith-based organisations, and political stakeholders.\"We reiterate our call on the government to uphold its international commitments to protecting fundamental freedoms and the constitutional rights of all Tanzanians to access information and express themselves freely,\" they added. The statement comes amid growing diplomatic pressure on Tanzania over reported human rights abuses during the disputed election.UN human rights office spokesman Seif Magango on Friday told a press briefing in Geneva that the Tanzanian government had \"intensified a crackdown against opponents since the vote\". \"Reports indicate that since mid-November, dozens of individuals including academics, civil society actors and local political leaders have been detained, with several arrests allegedly carried out by unidentified armed personnel,\" Magango  added. He said hundreds were reportedly killed and more than 2,000 detained after demonstrations broke out following the elections.\"We call for the immediate and unconditional release of all those arbitrarily detained.\"The US government on Thursday said it was reconsidering relations with Tanzania in the wake of its heavy-hand response against protesters.The State Department said the US \"cannot overlook actions that jeopardize the safety of our citizens, or the security and stability of the region\". In a statement on Friday, the Tanzania's foreign affairs ministry said it had noted these comments but urged other countries to wait for the results of the commission of inquiry before judging.In a defiant speech on Tuesday, President Samia angrily hit out Western nations, accusing them of interfering in the country's internal affairs. defended the use of force as \"necessary\" against protesters who \"were ready to overthrow the government\".She repeated accusations that unnamed foreign actors had colluded with opposition groups to cause \"regime change,\" without providing evidence to back up the claim.Samia said her government was ready to confront protesters in fresh demonstrations planned for Tuesday next week.The 65-year-old leader came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.She was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed.",

    "body": "22 hours agoBrandon DrenonAj AwerAj Awer, of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, says Trump's comments were \"dangerous\"Somali-Americans in Minnesota have described their heightened fear after US President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of the community this week.Community leaders told the BBC the \"apprehension is palpable\" following Trump's remarks, in which he said he did not want Somalis in the US and the country would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage\".\"When you're being targeted by the president of the United States, it's not really a good feeling,\" said Aj Awed, executive director of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, which represents a town known as Little Mogadishu for its large Somali population.Concern has also intensified because of reports that officials have begun an enforcement operation in Minnesota targeting undocumented immigrants.Mr Awed said the council would discuss the risks of holding an annual event scheduled for next week in-person because of the operation.\"The people that are getting caught up in this are people who don't speak that great of English, but who have been citizens for decades,\" he said. \"Just because you have an accent does not make you less American.\"Trump made disparaging comments criticising the Somali community at the White House on Tuesday. \"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you… their country is no good for a reason,\"he said.Mr Awed said the comments were \"dangerous\", adding it was \"not becoming of a president to be just attacking other Americans\".He also expressed concerns of violence that could follow.\"When the president puts a bull's eye on the immigrant community here\", that could encourage others to become \"more radicalised\", he said.President Trump's comments came after he was questioned about large-scale fraud in Minnesota's social assistance programme.Watch: Trump says he 'doesn't want' Somali migrants in USDozens of people have been charged over a scheme that federal prosecutors say involved a charity fraudulently billing the Minnesota government for meals for children during the Covid-19 pandemic. A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme, which ultimately cost the state tens of millions of dollars, according to Kayseh Magan, a former investigator in Minnesota's attorney general's office.While those accused of involvement represent a small fraction of Minnesota's large Somali population, Trump has repeatedly criticised the community, writing in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\".The House Oversight Committee said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's handling of the allegations.'Anyone who looks like me is scared' Jamal Osman, a member of the Minneapolis City Council, moved to the US when he was 14 and is a naturalised citizen. \"Anyone who looks like me [is] scared right now,\" he told CBS News.Of the fraud allegations that Trump has repeatedly referenced in his criticism of the Somali community, Osman said: \"My community is upset. Yes, people commit crimes, but an entire community should not be blamed based on what some individuals did.\"The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota.It said its enforcement operation would target those who have been issued final deportation orders. That operation began on Wednesday,  according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.Abdilatif HassanKowsar Mohamed says Trump's comments have led to increased concern\"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is already here,\" said Kowsar Mohamed, who lives in south Minneapolis. The city is home to more than 80,000 people of Somali descent.\"We're seeing boots on the ground activity where folks are just being plucked off of the streets and being asked about their residency status. That's not a data informed approach,\" she said.\"Most folks have the identification necessary, so the fear is not around proof. The fear is around mistakes happening.\"There have been numerous reports of masked federal officers detaining US citizens and other lawful residents - over 170 instances, according to a ProPublica investigation in October.Social media videos filled with images of ICE agents smashing suspect's car windows and throwing them to the ground during detainments add to immigrants' fears, whether undocumented or not.A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, denied that any people would be targeted based on race.\"Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,\" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. \"What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally.\"Local community organisations had been anticipating increased immigration enforcement, but after Trump's comments they ramped up preparations, Ms Mohamed said. One organisation, Monarca, has scheduled \"legal observer training\" in Minneapolis to educate people on their rights when witnessing federal immigration activity. Other ways the community is bracing itself, Ms Mohamed said, is by having emergency contacts ready-to-go in case of ICE encounters, and private messaging groups where people share photos of unmarked cars and masked agents.\"Everyone is just going to be in the space of caution,\" she said. \"Is there fear? Absolutely. But no one is tucking behind their tail.\" ",

    "body": "3 days agoWill GrantCentral America correspondent, TegucigalpaReutersPresidential candidate Salvador Nasralla has a small lead in the electionWith a little over two-thirds of the ballots in the Honduras election tallied, the lead has changed hands.The former vice-president, Salvador Nasralla, has a small but potentially significant lead over his rival, the conservative former mayor of Tegucigalpa, Nasry Asfura. Yet Asfura's National Party continues to brief journalists that they have the numbers for an eventual win.The race remains on a knife-edge. In Washington, President Donald Trump has staked his hopes on nothing less than an outright Asfura victory and has tried to directly influence the race in support of his favoured candidate.Whether it has been intimating that funds could be withheld from the impoverished Central American nation or making unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud, many in Honduras see the US president's fingerprints all over this election.To Honduran political analyst, Josué Murillo, it smacks of the kind of treatment Honduras expected from Washington during the Cold War.\"No government should come here and treat us as a banana republic. That is a lack of respect,\" he says in a coffee shop in Tegucigalpa.\"Donald Trump saying who we should elect violates our autonomy as a nation, and it affects our elections as well.\"Irrespective of whether the National Party go on to victory, one of their key figures is already celebrating.On Monday, ex-President Juan Orlando Hernández walked out of jail in Virginia a free man having served just one year of a 45-year sentence for drug-smuggling and weapons charges.His release came after Trump urged Honduran voters to cast their ballots for Asfura.Hernández was unexpectedly pardoned by Trump, despite having been found guilty last year by a court in New York of running a drug conspiracy which had brought more than 400 tonnes of cocaine into the United States.His time in office had also been marred by allegations of serious human rights violations by the police and security forces, particularly against government critics.So, when Hernández was arrested in 2022, then extradited to the United States and eventually jailed, most Hondurans celebrated it as a rare moment of justice in a nation riddled with institutional impunity, especially for the political elites.Trump has claimed the opposite, telling journalists on Air Force One that \"the people of Honduras really thought (Juan Orlando Hernández) was set up and it was a terrible thing\".ReutersEx-President Juan Orlando Hernández was extradited to the United States in 2022Journalists in Honduras who have covered the rise and fall of Hernández – from the moment he rose to national prominence following a coup in 2009 to his extradition – struggle to recognise that description of a roundly detested former president.However, he does still have his supporters, particularly in the National Party. And none have been more vocal in maintaining his innocence or calling for his pardon than his wife, Ana García Carías.I sat down with the former First Lady, who described Hernández's release as \"like being in a dream, a dream made reality\".\"We spoke to him this morning (Tuesday) and he is in a safe place. We were so happy, we got all the children onto the phone together with my mother-in-law, and shared a moment of happiness, laughter and prayer together.\"In terms of the future, the question now arises as to whether Hernández will attempt to return to Honduras. Ms García Carías says that his potential return depends less on the outcome of the election and more on whether the authorities will guarantee his safety.\"It depends on the security guarantees they give him in this country,\" she says.\"Day after day, this government – which thank God is on its way out – used a discourse of hate about my husband that they spoke of persecution against him. And that's very dangerous for an ex-president – to return to a place where they've cultivated hatred against him from the very top, the president, down to the lowliest functionary.\"Ms García Carías alleged her husband had been a victim of \"lawfare\", of \"the deep state\" and of a \"politically motivated witch-hunt\" by the Biden administration. I put it to her that the case against her husband had largely been drawn up by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the US Department of Justice during Trump's first term, not President Biden's.It was a point she quickly dismissed.\"That's what the prosecutors claimed but I think it's so illogical,\" she argues. \"In whose mind would it make sense to bring a man they say was a co-conspirator into meetings with the CIA, the DEA, to give classified information on national security?\"\"There was a political campaign (against him) involving figures in the Biden administration,\" she insisted, \"and I think there was manipulation of the facts after the event.\"ReutersAna García Carías, wife of the ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández, says he was a victim of the \"deep state\"Ms García Carías publicly recognised the role of two key MAGA figures in securing her husband's pardon: the influential conservative political advisor Roger Stone – himself the beneficiary of a Trump pardon – and the former Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz. \"They both got involved with the case,\" she says. \"I recognise and thank them for their contribution. In fact, I spoke to Mr Stone on his radio programme on Sunday and he said that he had taken a letter from Juan Orlando, which he had written on his birthday to ask for a pardon and delivered it directly to President Trump.\"Meanwhile, the vote count in Honduras carries on into another night.As the ballots continue to be tallied, it should soon become clear whether Trump will get his way in Honduras and see a new ally elected in the country just as he pardons an old one.​​",

    "body": "6 hours agoNavin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World ServiceGetty ImagesNamibia pioneered dehorning of rhinos to deal with their poaching Namibia's proposals to lift the ban on the international trade in black and white rhino horns have been rejected at a key conservation meeting.The result of the voting at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) earlier this week was adopted by the conference on Thursday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.Namibia had also proposed overturning the ban on African savanna elephant ivory - this too was defeated.Eyebrows were raised about the rhino horn trade proposals mainly because Namibia pioneered the practice of cutting the horns off rhinos in 1989 so they no longer have value for poachers. Dehorning was followed by other southern African countries, such as Zimbabwe, Eswatini and South Africa.Rhino horns are prized in traditional Asian medicine and are also status symbols in China, Vietnam, and some other south-east Asian countries.Namibia tabled two separate proposals - one for black rhinos and the other for southern white rhino.Both were resoundingly defeated, with only around 30 votes out of about 120 in favour.Cites regulations require a two-thirds majority for a proposal to be adopted.Getty ImagesBlack rhinos are listed as critically endangered speciesBlack rhinos are listed as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2023, there were only 6,421 alive - a decline of more than 90% since 1960, according to an IUCN report.The southern white rhinos are not in quite such danger - they are listed as near threatened, with a population of  15,752. But this is down 11% since 2023 and at its lowest point since the current rhino poaching crisis began nearly two decades ago.Cites banned the trade in the horns and other rhino parts in 1977 but their poaching continued with more than 8,000 lost in the last decade, according to Save the Rhino International.In Namibia, the number of rhinos poached was the highest on record in 2022, with 87 killed - almost twice as many as the year before, government data shows.Getty ImagesSome countries like India and Kenya destroy rhino horns stockpilesAlthough this was the first time that Namibia tabled the two proposals seeking the lifting of the ban on the rhino horn trade, the country has backed similar proposals by other southern African countries including South Africa, Eswatini and Zimbabwe in the past.Experts say the main reason these countries want the ban to be lifted is because of the huge stockpiles of rhino horns they have amassed over the years.\"Namibia and other pro-trade rhino range states have amassed large stockpiles of rhino horn they wish to trade,\" Taylor Tench, senior wildlife policy analyst with the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the BBC.\"Namibia's stockpiles are an estimated 6.45 tonnes of white rhino horn and an estimated 4.6 tonnes of black rhino horn. South Africa, on the other hand, likely has at least four times as much.\"The main reason why these countries have rapidly growing stockpiles of horns is believed to be the dehorning programme.The idea is that if a rhino does not have a horn, it is of no value to poachers and so won't be killed.The horn is removed above the growth plate, just like humans cut their nails, which means it is painless.But it also means that the horns grow back and need to be sawed off repeatedly.As a result their stockpiles are rapidly accumulating.\"The reason for not destroying the horn is speculative stockpiling, by both governments and private individuals,\" said Mr Tench.\"Some countries, like Kenya, destroy their rhino horn stockpiles, while others, like Namibia and South Africa, stockpile the horn in the hopes of cashing in if international trade is ever legalised.\"The governments of both countries have been approached for comment.Getty ImagesWildlife campaigners say legalising rhino horn trade will fuel demand and that will  increase poaching Supporters of the rhino horn trade argue that it would generate revenues that could be used to support conservation efforts.Experts say many private rhino owners in Africa support legalisation because of the high cost of anti-poaching measures.But those opposing the idea of opening up the trade argue that it would stimulate demand that would lead to a significant increase in poaching.They say the legal trade in rhino horn - especially domestic markets in countries like China and Vietnam - was a primary driver of the rhino poaching crisis of the 1970s and 1980s.Rhino populations around the world remain at risk from poaching and the illegal trade continues.Between 2021 and 2023, there were more than 150 rhino horn seizures, with an estimated 1.8 tonnes of horn - the equivalent of 716 whole horns - recovered globally, according to a recent report by Traffic and the IUCN.South Africa accounted for 66% of the seizures by weight, with significant shipments destined for Malaysia and Vietnam, the report said.",

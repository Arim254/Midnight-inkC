    "body": "The bodies of a 34-year-old woman and her daughter, 10, have been found inside freezers in an apartment in western Austria.The remains of the Syrian woman and child, who had been missing for several months, were discovered on Friday. The freezers were hidden behind a drywall partition in the flat, located in the city of Innsbruck.Two men, a 55-year-old Austrian and his 53-year-old brother, were arrested in June. The older man, a colleague of the Syrian woman, told police last week there had been an accident - but denied murder.Speaking to reporters earlier, Hansjörg Mayr, a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office, said the pair were being held on \"strong suspicion of murder\".The names of those involved have not been released by police, in accordance with Austrian law. The family's disappearance was first reported by the woman's cousin, who lives in Germany, on 25 July 2024. Police said the woman's colleague - the 55-year-old man - told them at the time she had gone on an extended trip with her child to visit her parents in Turkey.Her bank card was then found to have been used abroad several times. But when police searched the woman's home, her mobile phone was found.A witness also reported hearing a loud noise in the apartment, and cries of \"mama\", on the day the two were thought to have disappeared. A wider police investigation was launched, with officers discovering various messages sent from the woman's phone - including a resignation letter to her employer and messages to the male colleague. Authorities said a four-figure sum was also transferred to the man.Katja Tersch, head of the State Criminal Police Office in Tyrol, told reporters on Tuesday that a storage unit had been rented out before the victims' disappearance and a freezer had been placed there. The brothers removed the freezer from the unit on the day the woman and her child disappeared, Tersch said. And a week later, they acquired another freezer. Authorities say they believe this suggests the deaths were premeditated. \"The cause of death could not be determined due to the state of decomposition of the bodies,\" Tersch said.Mayr - of the public prosecutor's office - said the exact sequence of events is not yet known, but the bodies were professionally hidden and not discovered during a previous house search.While the brothers were arrested in June, it was not until 12 November that the 55-year-old admitted to an incident and to hiding the bodies. He denies any intent to kill, authorities said. Meanwhile, his younger brother admitted to a cover-up but denied knowledge of a homicide.The pair are currently in pre-trial detention in prisons in Innsbruck and Salzburg, around 117 miles (189km) apart.In a joint statement, Austria's Minister for Women Eva-Maria Holzleitner and Justice Minister Anna Sporrer said the \"alleged double murder... represents the sudden and brutal end of two human lives and exposes a cruel system\".\"Women and girls are being murdered due to the mere fact that they are women and girls,\" they continued.\"Femicides are a deeply rooted and society-wide problem that we must fight resolutely.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoSam Hancock and Hugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  ReutersAt least 13 people have been killed in an Israeli strike near a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, the country's health ministry says.The Israeli military said it had targeted members of the Palestinian armed group Hamas \"operating in a training compound... in the Ein el-Hilweh area\". It said the location was used by Hamas to plan and carry out attacks against Israel, which Hamas rejected as \"fabrication and lies\".Israel has carried out regular air strikes on people and places in Lebanon since a deal to end the conflict with the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Most strikes have targeted Hezbollah but Israel has also attacked Hamas in the country.As well as those killed, Lebanon's health ministry said at least four people had been injured in the strike.Images showed emergency workers at the entrance of Ein el-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon.Footage online also showed ambulances rushing through the narrow streets of the crowded camp as a huge plume of smoke billowed from the location hit.Initial reports said the strike hit an area outside a mosque that is usually busy at night. Condemning the attack, Hamas said it had \"no military installations in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon\" and that the site targeted was an \"open sports field\".In its statement, the IDF said \"prior to the strike, measures were taken to reduce the chance of harm to civilians, including the use of precision munitions, aerial observations, and additional intelligence information\".Hamas attacked southern Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel's military response has killed at least 69,169 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after the Lebanese group fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel and Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months that culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October 2024.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.",

    "body": "Superstar footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is to visit the White House on Tuesday, a US official has confirmed - the same day as the leader of Saudi Arabia where the Portuguese currently plays the game.The White House official did not say Ronaldo was part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's official delegation.However his starring role in the Saudi football league has seen him become a face of the country's modernisation drive under the crown prince, the country's de-facto ruler, who wants to reduce the country's dependence on oil revenues by diversifying into other areas including sports and tourism.The footballer is not believed to have been to the US since 2016.In the interim he has faced an allegation of sexual assault. Kathryn Mayorga alleged that Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009, which he denied.\"I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in,\" he said in a statement in 2018.In 2019, US prosecutors said Ronaldo would not face charges because the claims could not be proven. In early 2023, Ronaldo made the jump to Saudi Arabia when he became the face of the Saudi Pro League and captain of Al Nassr - the football club owned by sovereign wealth fund PIF which is chaired by the crown prince.In an industry where players are paid extraordinary amounts of money, Ronaldo's pay deal with Saudi Arabia was astronomical. The footballer was reportedly paid $200m (£152m) a year - or more than half a million dollars a day. Then in June this year, he signed a new two-year deal for a reported total of $400m (£300m) and became football's first billionaire player, according to Bloomberg, with a net worth of $1.4bn.That's a lot of money for a 40-year-old footballer in the twilight of his career.But, according to Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, Saudi Arabia has \"invested heavily in high profile events and individuals to put the kingdom on the map\" in terms of sports and tourism in its quest for modernism.Ronaldo has referred to Prince Mohammed as \"our boss\" in an interview with broadcaster Piers Morgan.Earlier this month, he appeared at a Ministry of Tourism event in Riyadh where he talked up the kingdom's development projects and his hopes for the 2034 FIFA World Cup being held in Saudi Arabia.As for meeting Trump, Vakil says: \"The US president likes shiny things and Ronaldo is a shiny thing.\" Though the footballer has loftier ambitions for the meeting in Washington - world peace. In July, European Council president Antonio Costa handed Trump a Portugal jersey signed by Ronaldo which read: \"To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace.\"He told Morgan: \"I hope to sit down with him someday because he's one of those people I really like.\"I think he can make things happen and I respect people like that.\"President Trump has already hosted the Saudi crown prince in the Oval Office and their next encounter is at a lavish black tie gala dinner in the East Room of the White House - which Ronaldo appears set to attend.The White House has so far been quiet about the guest list, but it will reportedly also include chief executives of prominent US companies, many of whom have business ties with Saudi Arabia.",

    "body": "7 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says Saudi crown prince \"knew nothing\" about Jamal Khashoggi's murderUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".It was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing. \"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" \"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\". A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report. While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.At the time, Saudi Arabia rejected the report as \"negative, false and unacceptable\". On Tuesday, Khashoggi's widow called on the crown prince to apologise for her husband's murder, for which she said there was \"no justification\".\"The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband @JKhashoggi,\" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi posted on X. Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year. Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\". The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis. Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin. The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s. The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added. The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday. Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also expected to be at the White House on Tuesday, a White House official confirmed to the BBC. Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues. ",

    "body": "Baby Shark: How a 90-second clip created a $400m business5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesWhen Kim Min-seok gave the go-ahead in June 2016 to publish a 90-second clip of a children's song, he had no idea what he was unleashing.It became a global phenomenon, clocking up more than 16 billion views - YouTube's most watched video ever.That song was the incredibly catchy Baby Shark.Not only has it captivated toddlers and terrorised adults around the world, it laid the foundations for its creator Pinkfong to become a media business worth hundreds of millions of dollars.“We didn’t expect it to stand out from our other content,\" Mr Kim, Pinkfong's chief executive, told the BBC from the firm's headquarters in Seoul.\"But looking back, it became a major turning point that set the stage for our global journey.”On Tuesday, that journey took Pinkfong to the South Korean stock market, where its shares rose by more than 9% on their debut, giving it a valuation of more than $400m (£304m).Getty ImagesPinkfong chief executive Kim Min-seok at the firm's stock market listing ceremony'We didn't expect a salary' Founded in 2010 as SmartStudy, the firm made digital content for children up to 12 years of age. It had just three employees, including Mr Kim and the firm's chief technology officer, Dongwoo Son.\"The office was tiny - even smaller than this,\" recalled Mr Kim, gesturing to the conference room he was calling from.It was so small \"we didn't even expect a salary at the time\", he said through a translator.Pinkfong went through several major overhauls, including shifting its focus to toddlers.The firm grew to around 100 employees and prioritised simpler, learning-based games and content. \"And that's when Baby Shark emerged,\" Mr Kim said.The company has been known as Pinkfong since 2022, a name inspired by a cheerful and curious fox that featured in one of its early cartoons.It now has around 340 employees, with offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Los Angeles.Getty ImagesThe firm was renamed Pinkfong after its cheerful and curious fox character in 2022The Baby Shark momentBaby Shark is believed to have originated in the US in the 1970s and was often sung at children's summer camps.The song, which repeats the phrase \"Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\" is \"attractive for children, though possibly annoying for adults,\" said media analyst Kevin Chew from the Nanyang Technological University. Mr Kim is also very aware of just how catchy it is.\"It's like a K-pop song. It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,\" he said, adding that the tune has a \"chanting\" effect, which makes it easy for children to remember.But it was an instant hit and only gained traction when its dance routine was featured at children's events in South East Asia.Videos of children and adults dancing to the song started to spread online and the clip went viral.There was a \"festival-like feeling\" in the Pinkfong office, as the team watched its viewing numbers soar, Mr Kim said.In November 2020, the Baby Shark clip claimed the title of YouTube's most viewed.It generated around half of the firm's revenue in the years immediately after the video's release and became a springboard for new content and merchandise, he said.Baby Shark: It's got a catchy tune and plans for world domination - but the toddler hit is older than you thinkBut Pinkfong faced a legal challenge in 2019 when it was accused of plagiarising the work of an American composer.South Korea's Supreme Court rejected the case, after the company argued that its version was derived from a folk song in the public domain.The victory, Mr Kim said, gave the firm a lift as its shares went public.One-hit wonder?Pinkfong's other franchises like Bebefinn and Sealook are growing fast but the firm must prove its success is not just reliant on Baby Shark, said Korea University business lecturer Min Jung Kim.The company's target audience is a major plus as toddlers tend to watch the same material repeatedly, she said. Kim Min-seok insists his business can grow beyond Baby Shark, which currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong's revenue. Meanwhile, Bebefinn has leapt ahead, generating roughly 40% of the firm's earnings.One parent told the BBC that his family has mixed feelings about Pinkfong's videos.Father of two Saleem Nashef said he appreciates the educational qualities of the firm's content but his wife thinks Baby Shark is \"too over-stimulating for kids\". Still, the viral video is apparently inescapable, as his daughter, who is about to turn three, will have a Baby Shark-themed birthday party.Whether Pinkfong can create other characters to match Baby Shark's commercial appeal remains unclear, said Prof Kim.It raised almost $52m in its stock market debut and plans to use the money to expand its line-up of films and characters, said Mr Kim.The company also aims to become a \"tech-driven\" content creator, using viewing patterns and other data to shape its new projects.Pinkfong has already achieved \"what many creators have always dreamed of,\" Mr Kim said.But now it must show investors that it is not just a one-hit wonder.",

    "description": "Both chambers of  Congress agreed to order the US justice department to release its files on sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein. The House of Repr",
    "body": "Both chambers of  Congress agreed to order the US justice department to release its files on sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein. The House of Representatives overwhelming approved the measure in a 427-1 vote and the Senate unanimously fast-tracked it without a formal vote. The moves come just days after President Donald Trump reversed his position and urged Congress to vote to disclose the records following public pushback from many of his supporters. Last week, Trump and his ties to Epstein were thrust back into the headlines after more than 20,000 pages of documents - some mentioning the president - were released. The White House denied any wrongdoing.Republican Clay Higgins, of Louisiana, was the sole House objector and cited his concern about “innocent people being hurt” with the release of the information. Trump’s reversal from attacking those on Capitol Hill who wanted the files released to saying there was “nothing to hide” surprised some in Washington. The Republican congressional leadership was caught off guard after aligning their message with the president for the past few weeks and opposing the release. House Speaker Mike Johnson had repeatedly called the push to release the Epstein files a \"Democrat hoax\". On Tuesday, he voted in support of release. What do we know about the Epstein files?Epstein saga reveals Republican rifts - and the power of Trump's baseThe only 'no' vote on releasing Epstein filesThe measure had been expected to take a few days to reach the US Senate, but after the resounding afternoon vote in the House, the timeline quickly sped up. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer brought up the bill on the floor of the Senate under a procedure called unanimous consent. Because no one objected, there was no debate and no amendments added to the bill. It will head from the Senate to the president‘s desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.A congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own.The bill requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell no later than 30 days after the law is enacted.Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs and people and entities connected to Epstein. But the bill also gives Bondi the power to withhold information that would jeopardise any active federal investigation or identifies any victims. Epstein, a financier, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking, having previously been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. During two criminal investigations into Epstein, thousands of documents were gathered, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses. Trump and Epstein previously socialised in similar circles, but the president said he cut ties with Epstein many years ago, before his 2008 conviction. The president also said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal activity. Last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email chains, including correspondence between Epstein and Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.Some of those make mention of Trump, including one email, sent in 2011, in which Epstein wrote to Maxwell: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.” The White House said last week that the victim referenced in the email was prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.Giuffre, who died in April, has said that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse and there is no implication of any wrongdoing by Trump in the emails.Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".The push for the release of the investigative files held by the Department of Justice was led by Republican Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman who sometimes dissents from his party, and Democrat Ro Khanna, a California congressman, both of whom introduced the legislation.Massie has faced criticism from Trump for his push to release the files, but has stood firm. “In 2030, he’s not going to be the president,” Massie said to ABC News over the weekend. He added that fellow Republicans who voted against release \"will have voted to protect paedophiles”. Another Republican who has pushed for the release of the files is House Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. She had been a staunch supporter of Trump before the two fell out over the issue, with the president now calling her a \"traitor\". At a news conference earlier in the day on Tuesday, Greene said she is speaking up on behalf of Epstein's survivors. She also called out Trump directly.\"Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves; a patriot is an American that serves the United States of America and Americans like the women standing behind me,\" Greene said.She said that row over Epstein has been one of the \"most destructive things\" to Trump's Make America Great Again movement since his election in 2016. Survivors of Epstein’s abuse also spoke at the news conference, urging lawmakers to release the files and pushing Trump to do the same.Epstein survivor Annie Farmer said that keeping the files under wraps amounted to “institutional betrayal”. “Because these crimes were not properly investigated, so many more girls and women were harmed,” Ms Farmer said.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro 'ready to talk' as US ramps up pressure15 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News Online'Face to face': Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro open to US talksVenezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has said that he is willing to hold face-to-face talks with representatives of the Trump administration as US pressure on him grows.Maduro made the comment hours after US President Donald Trump said he had not ruled out deploying ground forces to the South American country.The Trump administration has accused Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as rigged by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.Maduro has denied the allegation and accuses the US of trying to incite a war to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves. Since Trump was sworn in to a second term in office in January, the US government has been increasing its pressure on Maduro.It has doubled the reward it offers for information leading to his capture to $50m (38m) and in August launched a counternarcotics operation targeting boats it accuses of transporting drugs from Venezuela to the US.More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on suspected vessels since, most of them in the Caribbean as well as some in the Pacific.According to US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" is to remove \"narcoterrorists\" from the Western Hemisphere.But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs. It is also unclear how much of an impact the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.The size of the US military deployment - which includes the US Navy's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford - has also led to speculation both in Venezuela and in the US that its real aim is to remove Maduro from power.Trump has been repeatedly asked by journalists about his government's plan and has given seemingly contradictory answers. Asked by US broadcaster CBS on 3 November whether the US was going to war with Venezuela, Trump said, \"I don't think so\".But on Sunday, when asked whether he would rule out US troops on the ground in Venezuela, he answered: \"No, I don't rule out that, I don't rule out anything.\"However, when pressed on whether he would speak to his Venezuelan counterpart directly, he said: \"I would probably talk to him, yeah.\"  \"I talk to everybody,\" Trump added. Also on Sunday, the US state department said it \"intended to designate Cartel de los Soles\", the Venezuelan drug trafficking gang it alleges is led by Maduro, as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).But rather than doing so immediately, the state department said the move would become effective on 24 November. This delay - combined with Trump leaving the door open to direct talks - has been interpreted by some as a US ultimatum for Maduro: enter into negotiations or face even more draconian US measures.Being labelled as an FTO means it becomes illegal for US citizens to knowingly provide material support or resources to the group in question. According to the White House, it also then becomes the policy of the US to \"ensure the total elimination of these organisations' presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States\".Some analysts think that just as the Trump administration has argued that it is legal to target alleged drug boats in the Caribbean because of the danger they say they pose to US citizens, it could use the FTO designation to bolster support for strikes against the Cartel de los Soles on Venezuelan soil.In several of his recent public appearances, Maduro has addressed the US people directly, even speaking - and once even singing - in English. On Monday, he said \"dialogue, call, yes, peace, yes, war, no, never, never war\" and stressed that he was ready to talk \"face to face\" with anyone in the US \"who wants to talk to Venezuela\".Past attempts by various parties at negotiating with representatives of the Maduro government have failed. Talks between the Venezuelan opposition and the Maduro government mediated by Norway and held in Barbados broke down as did an earlier Vatican-backed effort at finding a way out of Venezuela's political crisis. While the US has been ratcheting up the pressure on Maduro, Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize Winner María Corina Machado has been trying to encourage the Venezuelan military to switch sides and turn on Maduro.Speaking and posting from an undisclosed location in Venezuela, where she has been hiding to escape arrest, Machado has long denounced the Maduro government as \"a criminal structure\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it. On Tuesday, she uploaded what she called a \"freedom manifesto\" to social media in which she outlined her vision for a post-Maduro Venezuela. In it she states that \"we stand at the edge of a new era - one where our natural rights will prevail\" and argues that Maduro and his close allies need to be held accountable for \"crimes against humanity\", citing the mistreatment of political prisoners and detainees under his rule.

    "body": "'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance1 day agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countries\"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.Cho says that when she was younger, people didn't know what it meant to be Korean in the USAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "12 hours agoAdam Easton,Warsaw correspondent and Jaroslav LukivTwo Ukrainian citizens who long worked for Russian intelligence have been identified as the suspects behind two acts of sabotage on Poland's rail network, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.One suspect had already been convicted in absentia of acts of sabotage in Ukraine, Tusk told parliament.On Monday, he visited the scene of an explosion near Mika, south-east of Warsaw, which damaged the railway line leading to the Ukrainian border at the weekend, and called it an \"unprecedented act of sabotage\".Another incident down the line near Pulawy on Monday forced a packed train to stop suddenly and damage was found to overhead cables.The Kremlin brushed off suggestions of Russian involvement.Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: \"It would have been really strange, if Russia hadn't been blamed first.\"\"Russia is accused of all acts of hybrid and direct war... in Poland,\" he told Russia's state-run media, adding: \"Russophobia is certainly rampant there.\"Polish authorities had initially said there was a very high chance that the two acts of sabotage on the Warsaw-Lublin railway line had been ordered by a \"foreign service\". Then a spokesman for Poland's special services minister said on Tuesday that \"everything points to them being Russian special services\".\"The goal was to cause a rail catastrophe,\" Tusk told MPs.The Polish prime minister said he would not disclose the names of the two suspects as this could complicate the operation, though he told parliament that one was living in Belarus and the other was a resident of eastern Ukraine.Both suspects had crossed into Poland from Belarus during the autumn and had now returned there via the border crossing at Terespol in the far south-west of Belarus, close to the Ukrainian border, he added.Tusk said that a military-grade C4 explosive device had been detonated on 15 November at about 21:00 (20:00 GMT) near the village of Mika.The explosion, which happened as a freight train was passing, caused minor damage to a wagon floor. It was captured on CCTV.Tusk said the train driver had not even noticed the incident.A previous attempt to derail a train by placing a steel clamp on the rail had failed, he added.The second act of sabotage, on 17 November, involved a train carrying 475 passengers having to suddenly brake because of damaged railway infrastructure, said Tusk.The prime minister also said he would issue an order later on Tuesday to raise the alert level on certain railway lines.He said since the start of last year 55 people had been detained on suspicion of assisting, preparing, or committing acts of sabotage and that 23 of them had been remanded in custody.Russia's motivation, Tusk went on, was to sow panic and stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Polish society, which is home to more than one million Ukrainian war refugees.\"I want to emphasise that what the Russian authorities care about is not only the direct effect of this type of action, but also the social and political consequences of the fact that this action is taking place,\" he said.\"This of course means disorganisation, chaos, panic, speculation and uncertainty.\"Poland is both a Nato and EU member state, and its railway network has become vital for moving supplies of aid into Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.In September, Tusk said three Russian drones had been shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspace during overnight attacks on Ukraine.He said at the time that authorities had recorded 19 drone incursions, with some flying deep enough to temporarily close four airports, including Warsaw's main hub Chopin.Russia's defence ministry responded by saying there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil.",

    "body": "A Lebanese man has gone on trial in Celle, northern Germany, accused of being a member of Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group whose military wing is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the EU.The 35 year-old man, named only as Fadel Z, in line with German privacy laws, is charged with having played a key role in procuring products for Hezbollah's drone programme.The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago, first working in public relations.In a statement, prosecutors said Fadel Z became a \"foreign operator\" for the group's drone programme in 2022, first from Barcelona in Spain. In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany.According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running \"an extensive drone programme for some time\".Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had \"systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel\".\"By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units.\"To procure such drones \"the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon\", prosecutors said.Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024.The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US.According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers.Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies.Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight.Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added.One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur.Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured.The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder.The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year.Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.",

    "body": "1 day agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and Wahiba Ahmed,JerusalemBBCChildren and families will perish, warns Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee CouncilAid agencies have reiterated calls for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza after the first heavy winter rainfall, saying more than a quarter of a million families need emergency help with shelters.\"We are going to lose lives this winter. Children, families will perish,\" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\"It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.\"With a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift.  They have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday. There are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water.\"My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,\" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City.\"We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.\"Fatima Hamdona (pictured) says her family's food perished in the rainThe story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis.\"Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,\" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday.  Her family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets.  \"We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.\"A recent UN report found that across Gaza more than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City.According to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter.The NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October.  They say they have 4,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.Jan Egeland blames what he calls \"a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire\" running \"counter to all humanitarian principles\" for the hold-up. In March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff.  However, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information.Many tents have fallen to pieces, leaving displaced Palestinians without proper shelterMany items, including tent poles, are also classed as \"dual-use\" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted.Cogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, told the BBC that \"over the last few months\" it had coordinated the entry of \"close to 190,000 tents and tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip\". It said that \"in accordance with the terms of the agreement\" of the ceasefire, it was allowing \"hundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies [to] enter the Gaza Strip every day, in coordination with the UN, international organizations, donor countries, and the private sector\". On Sunday, Cogat wrote on X: \"We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.\"It said it was working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that had been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan \"a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter\".International aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work.With a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed.\"It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,\" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator.  \"They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.\"Displaced Palestinians have nowhere else to go after so much of Gaza was devastated in the warPalestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza.They say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000.There are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly.\"I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,\" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  \"The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.\"\"Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.\"\"When the rain came, the tents couldn't protect us,\" says Rami Deif AllahIn Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children.He said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded.\"We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,\" he said. \"The water flooded us from above and below.\"Like all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling.\"We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,\" he went on.  \"Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.\"Correction 18 November 2025: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said NGO said 44,000 pallets of aid were being blocked from entering Gaza. The correct figure is 4,000.",

    "body": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to join talks with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Wednesday, as the Ukrainian president said he wanted to \"intensify\" peace negotiations.\"Bringing the end of the war closer with all our might is Ukraine's top priority,\" Zelensky said, adding that efforts would also focus on resuming prisoner exchanges.Turkey has maintained ties with both Kyiv and Moscow and has previously hosted talks between the two factions.But no Russian representative is set to join the meeting in Ankara, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He added that while there were \"no concrete plans\" for Vladimir Putin to speak to either the Turkish side or to Witkoff, the Russian president was \"of course open to a conversation\".Ankara will be the fourth capital Zelensky visits in only a few days. In Athens he secured a gas deal, in Paris he signed an agreement to obtain up to 100 fighter jets and in Madrid he held talks on co-operation with Spanish arms manufacturers.The visits are part of Zelensky's mission to try to shore up European support for Ukraine while Russian attacks on the country intensify and Moscow's troops close in on the key city eastern city of Pokrovsk.Domestically, Zelensky is facing the most serious crisis in years. Several members of his closest circle are under investigation for co-organising a large-scale criminal scheme, and two ministers have resigned. The scandal threatens to widen still and some EU leaders – who in December will decide whether to unblock a €140bn (£121bn) loan for Kyiv based on frozen Russian state assets – have warned Zelensky needs to do more to tackle corruption. As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war.Earlier in November Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia's conditions for a peace deal had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024.At the time, the Russian president demanded that Kyiv renounce any ambition to join Nato, as well as full Ukrainian withdrawal from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.Zelensky has repeatedly argued that withdrawing from Donetsk and Luhansk – together known as the Donbas – would leave the rest of the country vulnerable to future attacks.Following a long meeting with Putin in April, Witkoff appeared to suggest that a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv hinged on the status of the contested Ukrainian regions as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. This stance led to tensions with Zelensky, who accused him of \"disseminating Russian narratives\". Zelensky and Witkoff have not met since early September. Although the summer saw a flurry of high-level talks and meetings - including between Trump and Putin - American efforts to bring a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine closer have stalled.At one point, it appeared Trump and Putin were about to meet again in Budapest –but that summit was scrapped, apparently after the US side became aware that Moscow had no intention of budging from several demands that were unacceptable to Kyiv.But contact between US and Russian officials has continued, albeit under the radar. Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev was reportedly in Washington for meetings with Witkoff in late October, only days after Trump imposed sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies.",

    "body": "2 days agoAnbarasan Ethirajan and Tessa WongBBC NewsGetty ImagesMs Hasina oversaw a transformation in Bangladesh's economy but critics say she crushed dissentBangladesh's longest-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed began her political career as a pro-democracy icon, but fled mass protests against her rule in August 2024 after 15 years in power.Since then, Hasina has been in self-imposed exile in India, where she flew after being deposed by the student-led uprising which spiralled into nationwide unrest. On 17 November, a special tribunal in Dhaka sentenced her to death after convicting her of crimes against humanity. It was found Hasina had ordered a deadly crackdown on protesters between 15 July and 5 August 2024. She denied all charges against her.Up to 1,400 people were killed during the weeks of protests leading up to her ousting, most by gunfire from security forces, UN human rights investigators said. Their report found that she and her government had tried to cling to power using systematic, deadly violence against protesters. It was the worst bloodshed the country had seen since independence in 1971.The protests brought an unexpected end to the reign of Hasina, who had ruled Bangladesh for more than 20 years. She and her Awami League party were credited with overseeing the South Asian country's economic progress. But in recent years she was accused of turning autocratic and clamping down on any opposition to her rule. Politically motivated arrests, disappearances, extra-judicial killings and other abuses all rose under her rule. An order to 'use lethal weapons'In January 2024, Hasina won an unprecedented fourth term as prime minister in an election widely decried by critics as being a sham and boycotted by the main opposition. Protests began later that year with a demand to abolish quotas in civil service jobs. By summer they had morphed into a wider anti-government movement as she used the police to violently crack down on protesters.Amid increasing calls for her to resign, Hasina remained defiant and condemned the agitators as “terrorists”. She also threw hundreds of people into jail and brought criminal charges against hundreds more. A leaked audio clip suggested she had ordered security forces to \"use lethal weapons\" against protesters. She denies ever issuing an order to fire on unarmed civilians. Some of the bloodiest scenes occurred on 5 August, the day Hasina fled by helicopter before crowds stormed her residence in Dhaka. Police killed at least 52 people that day in a busy neighbourhood, making it one of the worst cases of police violence in the country's history.Hasina, who has been tried in absentia, called the tribunal a \"farce\". \"It is a kangaroo court controlled by my political opponents to deliver a pre-ordained guilty verdict... and to distract the world's attention from the chaos, violence and misrule of [the new] government,\" she told the BBC in the week before her verdict. She called for the ban on her party to be lifted before elections due in February.Hasina is also charged with crimes against humanity relating to forced disappearances during the Awami League's rule in another case at the same tribunal in Bangladesh. Hasina and the Awami League deny all the charges.Hasina and other senior members of her former government are also facing trial for corruption in a separate court - charges they deny.How did Sheikh Hasina come to power?Born to a Muslim family in East Bengal in 1947, Hasina had politics in her blood.Her father was the nationalist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's \"Father of the Nation\" who led the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971 and became its first president. At that time, Hasina had already established a reputation as a student leader at Dhaka University.Her father was assassinated with most of his family members in a military coup in 1975. Only Hasina and her younger sister survived as they were travelling abroad at the time.After living in exile in India, Hasina returned to Bangladesh in 1981 and became the leader of the Awami League, the political party her father belonged to.She joined hands with other political parties to hold pro-democracy street protests during the military rule of General Hussain Muhammed Ershad. Propelled by the popular uprising, Hasina quickly became a national icon.Getty ImagesPropelled by the pro-democracy movement in the 1980s and early 1990s, Hasina became a national iconShe was first elected to power in 1996. She earned credit for signing a water-sharing deal with India and a peace deal with tribal insurgents in the south-east of the country.But at the same time, her government was criticised for numerous allegedly corrupt business deals and for being too subservient to India.She later lost to her former ally-turned-nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, in 2001.As heirs to political dynasties, both women have dominated Bangladesh politics for more than three decades and used to be known as the \"battling begums\". Begum refers to a Muslim woman of high rank.Observers say their bitter rivalry resulted in bus bombs, disappearances and extrajudicial killings becoming regular occurrences.Hasina eventually came back to power in 2009 in polls held under a caretaker government.A true political survivor, she endured numerous arrests while in opposition as well as several assassination attempts, including one in 2004 that damaged her hearing. She has also survived efforts to force her into exile and numerous court cases in which she has been accused of corruption.Achievements and controversiesOnce one of the world's poorest nations, Bangladesh achieved credible economic success under her leadership from 2009.Its per capita income tripled in the last decade and the World Bank estimates that more than 25 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20 years.Much of this growth has been fuelled by the garment industry, which accounts for the vast majority of total exports from Bangladesh and has expanded rapidly in recent decades, supplying markets in Europe, North America and Asia.Using the country's own funds, loans and development assistance, Hasina's government also undertook huge infrastructure projects, including the flagship $2.9bn Padma bridge across the Ganges. But Hasina has long been accused of enacting repressive authoritarian measures against her political opponents, detractors and the media - a remarkable turnaround for a leader who once fought for multi-party democracy. Rights groups estimate there have been at least 700 cases of enforced disappearances, with hundreds more subject to extra-judicial killings, since Hasina took power again in 2009. Hasina denies involvement in these.Bangladesh's security forces have also been accused of serious abuses. In 2021, the US sanctioned its Rapid Action Battalion - a notorious police unit accused of carrying out numerous extra-judicial killings - citing human rights violations.Human rights activists and journalists also faced increasing attacks including arrests, surveillance and harassment. Hasina's government was also accused of \"judicially harassing\" targets with court cases, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus - who became head of the interim government after Hasina fled. He had been jailed earlier in 2024 and faced more than 100 charges, in cases his supporters say were politically motivated.Hasina's government flatly denied claims of such abuses, while also restricting visits when it was in power by foreign journalists seeking to investigate the allegations. The protests against civil service quotas, which sparked last year's uprising, came as Bangladesh struggled with the escalating costs of living in the wake of the pandemic. Inflation skyrocketed, the country's foreign exchange reserves dropped precipitously, and its foreign debt doubled since 2016.Critics blamed this on mismanagement by Hasina's government, claiming that Bangladesh's economic progress only helped those close to her.Getty ImagesBangladeshis wave the national flag on 5 August, 2025 as they celebrate one year since Sheikh Hasina was ousted from power",

    "body": "4 hours agoJessica Parker,Berlin correspondent, Baltic Sea and Ned Davies,BBC VerifyGetty ImagesThe BBC joined coastguards on the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\"Out on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker.\"Swedish Coastguard calling… Do you consent to answer a few questions for us? Over.\"Through heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt.\"I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,\" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin.This is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\"; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports.After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance.European coastguards and navies are regularly coming in contact with vessels in Russia's shadow fleet which they suspect are transporting oilSome \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data.Out on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating.As the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance.That is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, \"good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost\".Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag.The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says that vessels travel back and forth, past Estonia, to major Russian oil terminalsThe head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two.The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk.What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\"We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure.Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction.The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap.Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade.Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships.By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK.The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number.In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as \"false\". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry.The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called FMTC Ship Charter LLC, but our emails and our calls went unanswered.The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI.Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection.Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point \"where they just don't even bother at all\", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann.Unity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it.By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication.The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties.Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly detained at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages.Planet LabsAt the time of publication the vessel was anchored just outside the major Russian oil port, Ust-LugaUnity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to UK and EU service and port bans as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin.Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago.Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air finds that \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself.While politicians talk of toughening action, navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea.The right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it.Countries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event.\"There's a complexity associated with it,\" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. \"With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis.\"Frans SanderseUnity sailing under a former name, Ocean ExplorerThe Estonians speak from experience.When they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has \"constantly\" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk.The fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken.\"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, \"we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself\".\"Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies.\"Back on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up.\"Thank you for your co-operation,\" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia.The exchange lasted just over five minutes.\"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\"But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\"There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\".The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's \"anti-Russian sanctions\" were \"illegitimate\" and \"undermine established principles of global commerce\".\"Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,\" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to \"easily resolved\" issues such as administrative delays.It was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had \"heightened\" the risks by \"forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape\".Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray, Michael Steininger and Ali Zaidi",

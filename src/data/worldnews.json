Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.</p><p>James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.</p><p>The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home. </p><p>The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead \"used as a rental investment property\", which was being rented to a family of three.</p><p>The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.</p><p>Halligan said that, if convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison per count and up to a $1 million (£751,755) fine on each count.</p><p>James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said: \"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"</p><p>Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. </p><p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.</p><p>James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress.</p><p>The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.</p><p>In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. </p><p>During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a \"political witch hunt\" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law\". </p><p>James on Thursday said she stands behind her office's litigation against Trump and his organisation. </p><p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said James's indictment \"is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable.\"</p><p>The New York Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union called it \"the latest in a long list of brazen abuses of power by President Trump\".</p></div>",

With only 18 months before the end of Macron's presidency, he also warned that anyone joining his government would have to put on hold their presidential ambitions. </p><p>What makes it even harder for Lecornu is that he will face a vote of confidence in a National Assembly where Macron has no majority to support him. The president's popularity hit a record low this week, according to an Elabe poll that put his approval rating on 14%.</p><p>Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally, which was not invited to Macron's talks with party leaders on Friday, said that Lecornu's reappointment was a \"bad joke\", from a president \"more than ever isolated and disconnected at the Élysée\".</p><p>Bardella said his party would immediately bring a vote of no confidence against a doomed coalition, whose only reason for being was fear of an election. National Rally is currently leading in the polls.</p></div><div><p>Lecornu at least knows the pitfalls ahead as he tries to form a government, because he has already spent two days this week talking to parties that might take part.</p><p>He was first appointed prime minister on 9 September and took the next three weeks to put together a government, only for it to fall apart overnight when the the leader of the conservative Republicans, Bruno Retailleau, criticised one of the ministerial appointments.</p><p>By themselves the centrist parties cannot form a government, and there are splits within the conservative Republicans who have helped prop up Macron's governments since he lost his majority in elections last year. </p><p>Retailleau, who is known to have presidential ambitions, has made clear he will not be part of Lecornu II, and has declared the <i>socle commun</i> (common platform) of centrists and conservatives as dead. Not all his party colleagues agree.</p><p>But it means the centrist prime minister is also looking to left-wing parties for potential support.</p><p>In an attempt to court the left, Macron's team indicated the president was considering a delay to part of his highly contentious pension reforms passed in 2023 which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images National secretary of French left-wing Greens party Marine Tondelier (L) and President of Ecologiste et Social parliamentary group Cyrielle Chatelain speak to the press after a meeting with the French President at the Elysee Palace,\" /><span>AFP via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Marine Tondelier (L) of the Greens said she saw no reason not to bring a vote of no confidence in a Lecornu government </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>That risks angering key centrist allies, who fought hard to get pension reforms through.

But it is not an isolated occurrence.

They quickly detained the man, and a melee ensued as the group fought to stay together.</p><p>The crying woman, clinging to the detained man, was wrenched away by a federal officer - who appeared to be the same man who pulled Ms Moreta Galarza from her husband - as the man was carted off.</p><p>The judge closed the courtroom and, as a result, the BBC could not verify details of the case. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide details of the man's current status, but stated that the agency \"takes its responsibility to protect children seriously\".</p><p>They added that ICE gives parents the option of being removed with their children or having them placed with a designated individual.</p><p>After the images of the incident with Ms Moreta Galarza spread on social media, DHS reported that the officer involved in the incident had been disciplined.</p><p>Then last week, immigration officers were captured on video shoving two journalists to the ground as they tried to document a possible detention. One of the journalists could not get up, and was transported to the hospital.</p><p>\"Nothing like this has happened with journalists before,\" Olga Fedorova, the other photojournalist thrown to the floor, told the BBC. Ms Fedorova frequently reports from the building and said that before the incident, \"we were able to work with federal agents, around federal agents with no incidents 99% of the time\".</p></div><div><p>DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the BBC in a statement that officers were making an arrest when they were \"swarmed by agitators and members of the press, which obstructed operations\".</p><p>Ms McLaughlin said that \"officers repeatedly told the crowd of agitators and journalists to get back, move, and get out of the elevator\".</p><p>Chaotic encounters with government officials have played out multiple times in the lower Manhattan building this year, as immigration courts become key sites of a mass deportation initiative ordered by the Trump administration. </p><p>Half of the 3,320 immigrants ICE has detained in the New York City area between Trump's inauguration and the end of July were arrested at 26 Federal Plaza, according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project. The numbers suggest the building's immigration courts and offices are a primary engine of the administration's deportation plans in America's biggest city.</p><p>About three quarters of people arrested at 26 Federal Plaza since Trump's inauguration did not have past criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, the Deportation Data Project numbers suggest.</p><p>Officers routinely pull multiple detainees from their hearings, without giving them the chance to speak to lawyers.</p><p>\"We've never seen anything like this,\" said Benjamin Remy, a NYLAG lawyer who spends several days a week working with immigrants at Federal Plaza.</p><p>Many immigrants no longer show up to court, he said. At one August hearing, a man with a criminal record failed to appear. The judge therefore ordered him removed from the country and threw out his asylum case.</p><p>His attendance may not have changed the outcome; immigration enforcement was assembled outside that courtroom as well.</p><p>Non-citizens in the US without a visa or similar documentation have always been subject to removal, said Triciah Claxton, supervising attorney with Safe Passage, an immigration rights group focused on minors.</p><p>\"There used to be a concentrated effort on those who might have had criminal histories or prior arrests,\" said Ms Claxton, whose clients mostly appear virtually to avoid detention.</p><p>But now, she said, that net appears to have widened.</p><p>\"You see a lot of people who are in the process - they have asylum claims pending, they have other forms of relief pending – are still being taken in,\" Ms Claxton said.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b954/live/383f5ff0-8421-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b954/live/383f5ff0-8421-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b954/live/383f5ff0-8421-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b954/live/383f5ff0-8421-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b954/live/383f5ff0-8421-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b954/live/383f5ff0-8421-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b954/live/383f5ff0-8421-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b954/live/383f5ff0-8421-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images People wait to enter immigration court as federal agents patrol the halls \" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>People wait to enter immigration court as federal agents patrol the halls</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Legal experts say this is an abuse of the courts system and puts immigrants into an impossible position.

    "body": "5 hours agoBrandon DrenonReutersLuigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, will not face the death penalty if convicted, a court has ruled.US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed the federal firearms charges against the 27-year-old that carried the possibility of the death penalty.He will still face stalking charges, which can bring a maximum punishment of life in prison.Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as he walked into a New York City hotel on 4 December 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to all federal and state charges.After the ruling, Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo thanked the court for \"this incredible decision\", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"We're all very relieved,\" Agnifilo said. \"We're prepared, and have been prepared, to fight this case, and we look forward to fighting this case.\"In her ruling, Judge Garnett, a Biden appointee, said two of the four federal charges did not \"meet the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law\". She noted that her decision was \"solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury\".Garnett's ruling was a setback for the justice department, which had called Thompson's murder a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination\".The judge has given the government 30 days to challenge her decision to rule out the death penalty in the Mangione case.In a win for prosecutors, Garnett said they could present evidence to the jury from Mangione's backpack that he had at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.Among the items in the bag were a gun, fake IDs and a notebook with writings that allegedly detailed Mangione's grievances against the US healthcare system. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it illegally without a warrant. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a wealthy Maryland family, is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder.Father-of-two Thompson, 50, was shot from behind by a masked gunman as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for an annual investor conference. Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Thompson's murder.Law enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.Jury selection in the federal trial is due to begin on 8 September with opening statements due to start on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as July.In a separate incident, a Minnesota man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Mangione from the Brooklyn jail where he is being held. The suspect - Mark Anderson - was carrying a barbecue fork and pizza cutter, prosecutors say. He is now being held at the same facility as Mangione.",

    "body": "7 hours agoMaia DaviesEPATrump declined to say whether there was a timeline for withdrawing a large US naval fleet from waters near IranPresident Donald Trump has said Iran wants to make a deal rather than face US military action, despite Tehran's insistence that its missile and defence systems will \"never\" be up for negotiation.\"I can say this, they do want to make a deal,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday when asked about a build-up of US military forces in the Gulf, without providing details.He had warned Tehran on Wednesday that time was \"running out\" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme after a large US naval fleet had gathered near the country.Iran's foreign minister said there were no talks planned with the US at present but that Tehran was open to negotiations based on \"mutual respect\" and trust.Also on Friday, the Kremlin said the head of the Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani had met Russian President Vladimir Putin.They discussed \"Middle Eastern and international issues\" among other matters, state news agency Ria-Novosoti reported.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Asked on Friday whether he had given Tehran a deadline by which to strike a deal, Trump said that \"only they know for sure\".He told reporters: \"Hopefully we'll make a deal. If we do make a deal, that's good. If we don't make a deal, we'll see what happens.\"He said a large \"Armada\" was on its way to the region and declined to give a timeline for its withdrawal: \"We'll see how it all works out. They have to float someplace, so they might as well float near Iran.\"Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that the country's missile defence systems would \"never\" be on the negotiating table, and repeated the government's position that its nuclear programme was peaceful.At a press conference with his Turkish counterpart after talks in Istanbul to avert US action, he said preparations were needed for \"fair and just negotiations\".He had said help was \"on the way\", before saying he had been told the execution of demonstrators had stopped.On Thursday, he said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people, including more than 5,900 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December.It said it was also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.",

    "body": "10 hours agoMaia DaviesAPAlex Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospitalThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents, the US deputy attorney general has said.Todd Blanche said he did not want to \"overstate\" the move, calling it \"a standard investigation by the FBI when there are circumstances like what we saw\".The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the FBI would lead the investigation into Pretti's shooting in Minneapolis, with support from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division. His death came just weeks after Renee Good was shot dead by federal officers in the same city.\"We're looking at everything that would shed light on that day,\" Blanche told a news conference.He added the investigation would \"to the extent it needs to\" involve lawyers at the civil rights division.The investigation was previously being led by the Homeland Security Investigations branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.According to a preliminary DHS report sent to Congress, two officers fired their weapons at Pretti during a scuffle. Initial official accounts had alleged Pretti brandished his gun.The 37-year-old intensive care nurse, who was a US citizen, is understood to have joined protests in the city after Renee Good was shot dead by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on 7 January.Their deaths sparked fresh demonstrations in the state, and prompted public outcry across the US and criticism from lawmakers in both parties.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for federal agents to be withdrawn entirely from the state's capital region.The state has also asked a federal judge to stop Operation Metro Surge, the DHS's immigration enforcement initiative which began on 1 December and involves some 3,000 officers.President Donald Trump has said his administration is \"going to de-escalate a little bit\" in Minnesota, while his border tsar Tom Homan said on Thursday that the administration planned to \"draw down\" federal forces if local officials co-operated.\"We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter,\" Homan told a news conference in Minneapolis, without specifying what form a de-escalation might take.",

    "body": "13 hours agoDanielle KayeandNick Edser,Business reportersReutersUS President Donald Trump has picked Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve when current chairman Jerome Powell's four-year term ends in May.Warsh is a former Fed governor and was considered for chair during Trump's first term. He has been an outspoken Fed critic and is expected to support lower interest rates in the near term.The appointment comes amid mounting worries about the Fed's independence, following Trump's increasing attacks on Powell in recent months.Powell has angered Trump by not cutting interest rates quickly enough, and federal prosecutors recently opened a criminal investigation over testimony he gave to the Senate about renovations to Fed buildings.The Department of Justice (DoJ) probe prompted a forceful condemnation from Powell and messages of support from former Fed chairs and central bank heads.Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, had re-emerged in recent weeks as a potential choice for the top job as speculation grew over who would replace the under-fire incumbent.Announcing the nomination on Truth Social, Trump said Warsh \"will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best\".Warsh's appointment still needs to be approved by the Senate, meaning it could face lengthy delays.If confirmed for the role, he will take the helm of the Fed at an unusually tense time, as economists and Wall Street investors monitor threats to the central bank's autonomy.Who is Kevin Warsh? Warsh, a 55-year-old economist, is a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and serves on the board of courier UPS. He has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet.Warsh has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job, going as far as calling for \"regime change\".He had a relatively \"hawkish\" reputation as a Fed governor, meaning he tended to favour higher interest rates and took more seriously concerns about inflation.But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned his logic.The Fed this week voted to hold interest rates steady, despite the White House pushing for a cut. Policymakers are continuing to monitor the effect on the economy of last year's trio of interest rate cuts.There are signs the US employment market is stabilising - job creation is sluggish but the unemployment rate has ticked lower. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target.\"Warsh will have to convince his colleagues that rate cuts are appropriate this year, an argument that is unlikely to win unless the labour market shows renewed signs of weakening or inflationary pressures ease materially later this year,\" economists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note on Friday.Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. He is married to Jane Lauder, whose family is known for the Estee Lauder cosmetics group. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a long-time Trump donor and ally.Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has said he will oppose Trump's nominees until the potential legal case against Powell is resolved.Trump has also taken aim at Fed governor Lisa Cook, whom he wants to remove. He has accused her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which she has denied. The Supreme Court is now assessing the case.Warsh had been seen of one of four leading candidates for the Fed job. The other frontrunners were White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Fed governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street bond guru Rick Rieder.When Warsh takes up his role, financial markets will keep a close eye on how independently he acts of President Trump.Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said Warsh \"seems like a relatively safe choice\".\"Warsh's long-running hawkish views should help to counteract concerns that he might morph into a full-blown Trump stooge,\" he added.As news of Warsh's impending nomination started to leak out, the dollar strengthened slightly while the price of gold sank by 6%.Stuart Clark, portfolio manager at wealth management business Quilter, said investors would be \"breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief\" at Warsh's nomination.\"Warsh was in contention for the job back in 2017 and as such comes to the role with a level of authority that is respected across the market,\" he added.\"Concerns around Fed independence and an erosion on this should now be tempered, although Warsh's words and actions will be scrutinised by market participants intensely.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoNicolas NégoceBBC Africa, AbidjanAFP/Getty ImagesMamadou Hawa Gassama, seen here on a demonstration in 2018, is known for his outspokennessA Malian lawmaker has been jailed in neighbouring Ivory Coast for three years for insulting the 84-year-old Ivorian leader, who recently won a fourth term in office.Mamadou Hawa Gassama, who serves in the transitional parliament set up by Mali's junta, was arrested last July while on a trip to Ivory Coast.Prosecutors said he described President Alassane Ouattara as a \"tyrant\", \"an enemy of Mali\" and strongly criticised his leadership in interviews and on social media.Since Mali's military took power in 2020, relations with Ivory Coast have been strained. Ouattara, an ally of France - the former colonial power in both nations - has been critical of the takeover and other coups in West Africa.Since the Malian politician's arrest in Abidjan last July, the authorities in Bamako have not commented on the case.\"We believe that this decision is... excessive... it is very severe,\" the AFP news agency quotes Gassama's lawyer Mamadou Ismaila Konate as saying.Prosecutors argued that Gassama's remarks went beyond political critique, accusing him of deliberately seeking to undermine Ivorian institutions and sow discord between the two neighbours.It is a reminder of the diplomatic row that blew up two years after the coup, when 49 Ivorian soldiers were sentenced in Mali to 20 years in prison for undermining state security.Since then, Mali's military leaders have overseen the exit of the UN peacekeeping mission and French forces, which had deployed to Mali in 2013 to help deal with an escalating jihadist insurgency.Instead it has sought closer ties with Russia - and Russian mercenaries have been brought in to deal with the insecurity affecting several countries in the vast Sahel region.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "13 hours agoMaia DaviesandImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentGetty ImagesAntónio Guterres said the organisation's money could run out by JulyThe United Nations is at risk of \"imminent financial collapse\" due to member states not paying their fees, the body's head has warned.António Guterres said the UN faced a financial crisis which was \"deepening, threatening programme delivery\", and that money could run out by July.He wrote in a letter to all 193 member states that they had to honour their mandatory payments or overhaul the organisation's financial rules to avoid collapse.It comes after the UN's largest contributor, the US, refused to contribute to its regular and peacekeeping budgets, and withdrew from several agencies it called a \"waste of taxpayer dollars\". Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay.Though the UN General Assembly did approve a partial change to its financial system in late 2025, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis compounded by a rule that means it is refunding money it never received.At its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down.Guterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was \"categorically different\".\"Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced,\" the secretary general said, without naming specific members.He said the \"integrity of the entire system\" depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their \"assessed contributions\" - adding that 77% of the total owed had been paid in 2025, leaving a record amount unpaid.Guterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a \"double blow\" in which it was \"expected to give back cash that does not exist\".\"I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received.\"As a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars it never actually had. The letter reads: \"Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m [£165m]  – funds we have not collected.\"\"The bottom line is clear,\" Guterres wrote. \"Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse.\"UN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult. The US is the UN's largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its \"great potential\" and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts.The US did not pay its contribution to the UN's regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations.Other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN's work.Guterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a \"race to bankruptcy\".Trump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza.The US president has said its work would happen \"in conjunction with the United Nations\" - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN's place, he replied: \"Well, it might.\"The US officially left the UN's World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so.Other agencies are also making huge cuts. The UN's human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity.In Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.",

    "body": "Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family1 day agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentCCTVDozens of members of the Ming family were sentenced in SeptemberNo-one should be surprised that China has swiftly executed the 11 members of an organised crime family from north-eastern Myanmar who were sentenced to death in  September.China executes more people than anywhere else in the world, according to  human rights groups – the exact figure is a state secret. Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious.The Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar's impoverished Shan state, since 2009.They rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s.The four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud.Chinese Ministry of Public SecurityMing Zhenzhen and Ming Guoping in the custody of Chinese policeThey remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for \"extraordinary contributions to state development\".His Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP.The scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine.Tens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate \"pig-butchering\" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media.The most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action.With China's apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely.They detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said.Getty ImagesShe Zhijiang, who is accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, was extradited to China last yearDuring interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength.These details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded.The four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet.China has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar's war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial.The scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down.And it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.",

    "body": "Healthcare, visas and whisky: What did UK and China get from Starmer's visit?21 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesChina and the UK have called for a reset in economic relationsSir Keir Starmer's visit to China this week is the clearest sign yet the two countries are seeking to end the diplomatic \"ice age\" that has defined their relationship.Both leaders face economic pressures at home and are seeking new opportunities for trade and investment.For Sir Keir, the first UK prime minister to visit China since Theresa May in 2018, the trip was a chance to highlight the strength of British firms in finance, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, clean energy and car making.President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, aimed to show that China can be a reliable partner for Western economies, as US President Donald Trump continues to rattle the global trading system.Although no sweeping free trade deal was reached, the visit marked a cautious but tangible reset of UK–China economic ties.Agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green technology and finance, combined with revived dialogue, might lead to better access for British firms to Chinese markets and greater Chinese investment in the UK.What deals were agreed?The biggest commercial announcement came from AstraZeneca, which promised to invest $15bn (£11bn) in China over the next four years, to expand research and the manufacturing of medicines – the company's biggest investment in China to date.In the energy sector, British firm Octopus Energy is entering the Chinese market for the first time through a partnership with local company PCG Power to develop a digital platform for trading electricity.The project aims to improve efficiency in the power system and support China's efforts to increase the use of renewable energy.For Octopus, which has grown quickly in the UK, the deal allows entry into China's large and growing energy market, where demand for clean energy and digital trading is rising.Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy who was part of the UK's business delegation to China flagged that the country's scale and innovation have made solar, wind energy and batteries cheaper. \"Now there's a huge opportunity for Britain to succeed as we build the solutions that use these products to cut the cost of electricity,\" he added.China also agreed to halve tariffs on Scotch whisky, a deal the UK government said could generate £250m for the British economy over the next five years.\"Our whisky distilleries are the jewel in Scotland's crown,\" Sir Keir said. This is \"proof that our pragmatic, hard-headed international engagement brings benefits at home\", he added.Scotch whisky is a key export for Britain's drinks sector, with more than £5bn in annual exports. In recent years, China has been one of its fastest-growing markets.Industry groups welcomed the move, saying it would help Scottish distillers compete in a crowded market where US, European and Japanese firms are also vying for customers.Another outcome of the trip was visa-free travel for British citizens visiting China for up to 30 days for holidays and business, putting the UK on par with around 50 other countries, including France, Germany, Australia and Japan.Both sides also agreed to cooperate on disrupting migrant-smuggling networks, a top priority for Sir Keir's government. For Beijing, renewed ties with the UK - a major European economy and close US ally - signal that China remains a dependable partner for the West despite Trump's trade tensions.Economically, the reset secures access for Chinese exporters of high-value goods such as electric vehicles, solar panels and clean energy, while creating opportunities for Chinese investment in British services, finance and green tech.Chinese state media framed the visit as a step toward turning the \"potential of China–UK cooperation into real achievements that benefit both peoples and the world\".British firms were also quick to emphasise the benefits for both countries through the expanded partnerships.\"The prime minister's visit, the first in eight years, is a significant moment, signalling the importance of the economic relationship between the UK and China,\" Chris Fitzgerald, group director for international affairs at Octopus Energy told the BBC from China.\"Such partnerships mean we can bring affordable, secure, clean energy to British customers... And we can use our technology and know-how to bring some of the same benefits to Chinese customers.\"What challenges remain?Foreign businesses have long complained about the difficulties of doing business in China, flagging red tape, complex regulations, and a lack of transparency.These can complicate investment decisions and create uncertainty for companies.\"Any market has its own challenges, so of course we've got to be clear eyed and seek expert advice,\" Fitzgerald said.\"We have had good discussions with the Chinese officials who have welcomed our entry. And we have been careful to choose an excellent partner... So we are excited to take the immense opportunity that the world's largest renewable energy market offers.\"Sir Keir's Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, making the China visit a high-stakes test.Despite scrutiny at home, improving relations with the world's second-largest economy has been a priority for the British prime minister.The move, however, requires a delicate diplomatic balancing act.US President Trump recently warned that Canada could face 100% tariffs over deals struck with China during Mark Carney's visit, and he has warned the UK about deepening its commercial ties with Beijing.Sir Keir has insisted that Britain does not need to choose between Washington and Beijing, framing the reset as a pragmatic way to support growth at home while managing geopolitical risk.At the UK–China Business Forum in Beijing on Friday, he described meetings with Xi as \"very warm\" and highlighted the significance of agreements on visa-free travel and whisky tariffs.These offer British firms \"really important access\" and are \"symbolic of what we're doing with the relationship\", he said. \"That is the way that we build the mutual trust and respect that is so important.\"Sir Keir's visit is one of a flurry of trips to Beijing, as leaders from France, Canada and Finland seek to hedge against an increasingly unpredictable United States.With Washington pursuing aggressive tariff policies and even making threats over Greenland, these so-called middle powers are looking to diversify trade and investment partners while securing new markets.At the same time, these countries will be watching closely the deals that the UK, Canada, France and others are striking with China.They will all need to remain competitive in attracting Chinese investment and accessing the world's second largest economy.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNardine SaadReutersCatherine O'Hara, the comedic actress best known for her starring roles in the Home Alone and Beetlejuice films, as well as her Emmy-winning turn in Schitt's Creek, has died aged 71. The Canadian star rose to fame through Toronto's Second City improvisation troupe and on SCTV, before making a name for herself in the US in 1988's Beetlejuice and as the matriarch in the holiday classic Home Alone.O'Hara, whose colleagues remembered her as a \"wonderful person, artist and collaborator\", who most recently appeared in the Emmy-winning comedy The Studio and HBO's The Last of Us.In a statement to the BBC, O'Hara's agent said she died  on Friday at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness.O'Hara made lightning strike twice in her career with indelible cinematic turns.In 1988's spooky satire Beetlejuice, she played Delia Deetz who led her possessed dinner guests in an enthralling song and dance performance of Day-O (the Banana Boat song).Two years later, in Home Alone, her panicked scream of \"Kevin!\" as she realises her mischievous eight-year-old son had been left behind during their Christmas holiday became is among the most memorable moments from one of the most successful film comedies ever. Her young co-star Macaulay Culkin, now 45, paid tribute to his on-screen mother on Friday, sharing images of the two of them from the film and in later years: \"Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later.\"'I'm so proud of you' - O'Hara speaks at Macaulay Culkin Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremonyThe Toronto-born actress got her foot in the door as a waitress at the Toronto Second City theatre franchise in the 1970s, before auditioning for a role with the famed acting troupe.She further developed her comedic chops after joining the cast of sketch comedy show Second City Television (SCTV) -  one of the most successful Canadian TV programmes ever - alongside the likes of Eugene Levy and the late John Candy.She has credited her Canadian roots with helping develop her sense of humour.In 2020, she told Rolling Stone that growing up Canadian didn't have the same sense of nationalism or patriotism that she saw in the US.\"And that's a good thing because it does make you look outside of yourself and be aware of the world and not take yourself seriously,\" she said.\"And I think Canadians have not only a sense of humour about others but also about themselves.\"Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney joined Canadians and fans across the world in mourning O'Hara.\"Over 5 decades of work, Catherine earned her place in the canon of Canadian comedy — from the iconic Toronto production of Godspell to SCTV to Schitt's Creek,\" he said. \"Canada has lost a legend.\"O'Hara also collaborated with Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy four times, including on the critically acclaimed mockumentary films Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration. Her role as character actress Marilyn Hack in For Your Consideration earned her the 2006 National Board of Review Award for supporting actress.In a statement to Variety, Guest said he was devastated and that \"we have lost one of the comic giants of our age\".O'Hara had a late career surge thanks to the Canadian comedy series Schitt's Creek that became one of the biggest hits of the Covid lockdown.The fish-out-of-water comedy show followed the wealthy Rose family as they abruptly lose their money and mansion, and are forced to move into a shabby motel in a deadbeat town they bought as a joke.Getty ImagesSeth Rogen and Catherine O'Hara presented an award together at the 2026 Golden GlobesO'Hara's character Moira was a particular delight, with her wildly fluctuating accent, outlandish fashion sense, and brilliant one-liners, like \"Never assume, Twyla, because when you assume, it makes an ass out of... both of us.\"Upon winning the Emmy Award for actress in a comedy, O'Hara thanked her co-stars Eugene and Dan Levy for giving her the opportunity to play \"a woman of a certain age - my age - who gets to fully be her ridiculous self\".Dan Levy who played her son David in the series, which he also co-wrote and produced, said it was a gift \"to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O'Hara's brilliance\".\"Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family,\" he wrote. \"It's hard to imagine a world without her in it. I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her.\"O'Hara had continued working until very close to her death, playing a therapist in HBO's sci-fi drama The Last of Us and an ousted movie executive in Seth Rogen's The Studio just last year.In The Studio she played Patty Leigh, a studio boss replaced by Rogen's character, who pursues more creative roles as a film producer and makes her way to the Golden Globes - a stage that O'Hara was no stranger to. She won a Golden Globe award for best actress in 2021 for her role in Schitt's Creek and was nominated for her role in The Studio at this year's awards.She is also nominated at the Actor Awards (formerly the Screen Actors Guild Awards), which take place in March, for her role as Patty.Rogen on Friday said that when he first met O'Hara, he told her she \"was the funniest person I'd ever had the pleasure of watching on screen\" and that Home Alone was the film that made him want to make movies.\"Getting to work with her was a true honour,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"She was hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous… she made me want to make our show good enough to be worthy of her presence in it. This is just devastating. We're all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it.\"Film director Judd Apatow, replying to Rogen's post, added: \"Brilliant and kind. Riotously funny for fifty years. A really special person.\"O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch and sons Matthew and Luke, as well as her siblings Michael O'Hara, Mary Margaret O'Hara, Maureen Jolley, Marcus O'Hara, Tom O'Hara, and Patricia Wallice.With additional reporting by Jessica Murphy in Toronto and entertainment reporter Steven McIntosh.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesKevin Warsh has previously worked at the Federal Reserve and on Wall StreetDonald Trump has been calling for change at the US central bank. Now, with Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve chairman poised to end in May, he could be about to get his wish.On Friday, the US president announced Kevin Warsh - a conservative whom he had passed over for the post, to his regret, during his first term - as his choice to replace Powell. \"Warsh \"is 'central casting' and he will never let you down,\" Trump declared on social media as he announced the decision. The irony of the choice was lost on no one. Warsh has made his name as a supporter of higher interest rates - a reputation he has tried to shed in recent opinion articles and media appearances. It's a position that would seem to put him at odds with Trump, a self-described \"low interest rate guy\", who has criticised Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough and who has made no secret that his choice to lead the Fed should be on board with his views.It remains to be seen whether Warsh's selection will lead to the bank Trump wants.Warsh brings a traditional background to the job: an Ivy League education, a prior stint at the Fed, as well as time on Wall Street and at the Hoover Institution - a conservative economic think tank.Supporters say he is sensitive to concerns about the bank's independence and alert to the risks if its policies serve short-term political aims rather than the wider economy.Lee Ohanian, an economics professor at UCLA and senior fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution, who has known Warsh for years, said taking directions from Trump \"would diminish the Fed. It would diminish the office of the chairman, and it would create tremendous turmoil in the financial markets. Kevin knows that\". His nomination has drawn praise from establishment figures including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Mohamed el-Erian, a high-profile economist with a long career on Wall Street.Critics have questioned whether it is the fact that Warsh's father-in-law, Ronald Lauder, is a Trump donor and friend that got him the job. Others say his record as a policymaker is poor, noting that Warsh opposed economic stimulus during the 2008 financial crisis as he fretted the policies would lead to inflation – a minority view then and now.  Congressman Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, accused Warsh of showing \"willingness to wildly alter his views...based on who is in the White House\".But on balance, many in financial circles see him as a responsible pick. \"There appears to be at least some degree of comfort with a Warsh-led Fed vs. the other choices,\" Wells Fargo analysts said on Friday - noting that his relatively sparse public profile in recent years implies a degree of uncertainty. \"Investors should be thankful,\" Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, told the BBC.What Warsh could mean for interest rates?The acceptance of Warsh is partially a gamble that a Fed with him in charge might not change much. After all, despite Trump's complaints, the Fed cut interest rates three times last year and most analysts expect additional cuts this year – regardless of what Trump thinks.That's good news for borrowers in the US, who may see lower rates on mortgages, car loans and other kinds of debt - and maybe for the president too, if this makes people feel better about the economy. It also means Warsh does not necessarily have to surrender his credibility as an independent economist to deliver lower interest rates for Trump. 'Mission creep' at the FedWhere differences might be felt more is in other parts of the Fed, which Warsh has accused of \"mission creep\" and taking on too big a role in the economy. He wants to reduce its role in bank regulation and cut back study of issues like climate change - putting him in alignment with the White House. He, like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is a fierce critic of the interventions the Fed made in markets after the 2008 financial crisis and again during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has left the bank with huge holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Warsh maintains these policies prop up the stock market and other assets - benefiting the wealthy and big financial interests rather than the mainstream economy - and has called for reducing those holdings and coordinating their management more closely with the Treasury Department.Whether he would actually lead the Fed to shrink its balance sheet more quickly than the bank has been doing is unclear. One effect of doing so could be higher borrowing costs - exactly the opposite of what Trump wants to see. On Friday, gold prices dropped and the dollar gained, suggesting traders see Warsh as likely to stick to his initial instincts as a \"hawk\" who favours higher interest rates. Narayana Kocherlakota, a finance professor at the University of Rochester, who served on the Fed with Warsh, said he thinks he would go against the president if conditions called for it. \"He's very smart and he's very independent. And I think that's the kind of person that Americans should want at the head of their central bank,\" Kocherlakota said. Others argue Warsh's thinking on the economy has evolved to be closely aligned with Trump, including downplaying concerns that rapid growth and rising wages could fuel inflation. \"Warsh is not the Fed's guy, he is Trump's guy, and has shadowed Trump on monetary policy almost every step of the way since 2009,\" wrote Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Group. For now, Warsh may look like the candidate most likely to satisfy all parties. But Trump's swift turn on Powell - his last pick for Fed chair - should serve as a cautionary reminder.

    "body": "2 hours agoNardine SaadLos Angeles, California Watch: Coyote spotted swimming to Alcatraz IslandA lone coyote that swam more than a mile across the San Francisco Bay to Alcatraz Island is being monitored by scientists and could be moved if its presence threatens birds on the infamous Californian island. The canine, called Floyd, appears to be thriving on The Rock - renowned for its abandoned prison - and getting by on an avian diet. Whether Floyd can stay on Alcatraz \"depends entirely on how it behaves\", says Aidan Moore, a local tour guide who shared footage of the coyote's journey. Complicating matters, he adds, is that there are no fresh water sources, which could make the animal's welfare dependent on human intervention.Video footage of Floyd - believed to be a male - hopping onto Alcatraz's rocks was captured by a tourist and shared with Moore. The gaunt coyote appeared to be shivering from the bay water which is about 10C (50F). But he has plumped up since, says Moore, who is originally from the Cotswolds, in England.On Saturday, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) observed and photographed the coyote. The GGNRA confirmed to the BBC that the animal is believed to be the same coyote seen swimming to and coming ashore on the island nearly two weeks earlier.This coyote is the first documented coyote presence on Alcatraz since the island was transferred to the National Park Service in 1972, the GGNRA said.  Park biologists and staff are actively monitoring the coyote to better understand how it is surviving on the 22-acre (89,030m) island and to assess any potential impacts to the seabird breeding colony, the GGNRA said.The coyote's presence, it added, does not affect public access to the island, which remains open to visitors.Alcatraz island - nicknamed \"the Rock\" because it was regarded as an impregnable fortress  - is home to the shuttered federal penitentiary that housed some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It also served as the backdrop of the 1996 action thriller The Rock starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage and the 1979 drama Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood. Coyotes, the wolf-like creatures that are native to North America, are not uncommon in the San Francisco Bay. According to Moore, nearby Angel Island has at least 16 coyotes that are thriving there because there's fresh water and bigger prey, such as deer, that they can hunt. But not so on Alcatraz, part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and a registered sanctuary for seabirds, whose sensitive nesting time runs from February through September.Floyd has to be able to catch enough birds to sustain his dietary needs, Moore says, and suspects that catching them is like shooting fish in a barrel given the thousands of birds there.Floyd might also be staying hydrated with rain puddles and by water from the gardens on the island, said Janet Kessler, a self-taught naturalist who has been documenting coyote behaviour in San Francisco for about 20 years.Kessler told the BBC that she suspects Floyd made the journey because he might have felt interspecies territorial pressure in the city and needed to find a new area to call home.\"He can't go anywhere. When he gets to a territory, they're going to drive him out of that territory, because that's what coyotes do,\" Kessler said. \"That's actually what limits our population. That's their natural population control is their territoriality.\"Coyotes could be leaving the mainland because the Bay Area is becoming too crowded, Brett Furnas, a wildlife ecologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, told the Los Angeles Times.The species was driven out of the city but re-emerged about 25 years ago, he said, since which sightings have increased.While coyotes are adaptable and natural survivalists, tour guide Moore is worried about Floyd's future and is pushing for human intervention. But finding him might be a challenge as coyotes are \"masters of disguise\", he says. And the coyote seems to be hiding in areas that are not accessible to the public. Moore and his colleagues have been trying to spot him on their walks, but instead have only found evidence he is leaving behind, like half-eaten birds. Some of his droppings have been collected and are undergoing DNA testing to get a better sense of Floyd's origins, he says. Whether he will stay or go appears to be dependent on his behaviour too, and the tourists visiting the island. Project Coyote, a North American organization focusing on science-based education around the animals and coexistence, is concerned that the barrage of visitors to Alcatraz could pose safety risks for both the animal and tourists.Most conflicts with coyotes stem from humans either intentionally or unintentionally feeding them, says Project Coyote founder Camilla Fox. \"Coyotes are incredibly resourceful and able to coexist with coyotes even in the most densely populated urban environments,\" Fox told the BBC. \"So if not harassed, we believe this coyote could survive on the island- though it could be a lonely existence without a mate.\"We hope whatever decision is made by the National Park Service, this coyote will have an opportunity to thrive and flourish.\"Kessler, the naturalist, believes this coyote might leave the island at some point because it's too small of a territory.\"This is new to everybody. We're all going to be watching and seeing what this coyote does,\" Kessler said. \"I would assume, at some point, if he wants to go back, he'll swim.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: \"I will not be silenced\", says Don Lemon after arrestFormer CNN host Don Lemon has appeared before a judge after being arrested for entering a Minnesota church and filming anti-immigration enforcement protesters as they disrupted a service.After appearing in court, Lemon was released from custody. He told media outside that he was arrested for covering the news, adding: \"I will not be silenced.\"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said he was charged with \"conspiracy to deprive rights\" and \"violation of the FACE Act\", by allegedly interfering in someone's First Amendment rights by force. Lemon went into the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with protesters who said one of the pastors was an immigration enforcement official.Getty ImagesLemon, an independent journalist, said he was taken into custody by federal agents on Thursday. He did not enter a plea in court. \"Last night the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something that I have been doing for the last 30 years and that is covering the news,\" Lemon said. \"I have spent my entire covering the news. I will not stop now,\" Lemon added. \"In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.\"Lemon has been charged with violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances and Places of Religious Worship (FACE) act, which is a law that typically has been used to crack down on demonstrations at abortion clinics but also prohibits obstructing access to houses of worship.US Department of Justice questioned over arrest of Don Lemon\"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell said earlier on Friday in a statement posted on Lemon's Instagram account. The lawyer added: \"This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand.\"Lowell said Lemon had been arrested while he was in Los Angeles covering the Grammy Awards.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said three others had been arrested: local independent journalist Georgia Fort, along with activists Trahem Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy.Fort was also released earlier on Friday after her court appearance in Minnesota. America's top law enforcement official accused them of participating in a \"coordinated attack\" on the church. FBI Director Kash Patel said investigators from his agency and the DHS had arrested Lemon and the other three.Fort posted a livestream of federal agents arriving at her home to arrest her. \"Agents are at my door right now,\" she said in the clip. \"My children are here, they're impacted by this.\" President Donald Trump's administration initially sought to charge eight people involved in the Minnesota church protest with conspiring to deprive rights and interfering with someone's religious freedom in a house of worship.But a magistrate judge who reviewed the evidence approved charges for only three of those involved, excluding Lemon.The government challenged that decision, but an appeals court suggested prosecutors take the case to a federal grand jury - a panel of citizens that evaluates if there is enough evidence to charge someone in a case.A longstanding Trump critic, Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the company. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime. In the Minnesota church protest, he live-streamed with protesters on YouTube. The broadcast began with Lemon standing with the group in a car park where he says: \"This is an operation that is secret.\"I can't tell you what is going to happen, but you're going to watch it live unfold here on 'The Don Lemon Show.'\"He followed the group - whom he called \"resistance protesters\" - into the church, initially without his camera operator. His microphone picked up audio of a woman shouting \"excuse me pastor\". Protesters chant \"Justice for Renee Good\", referring to the US citizen who was fatally shot in her vehicle on 7 January during a confrontation with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis.Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other. Lemon repeatedly says he is there as a journalist and is unaffiliated with demonstrators.\"We're not part of the activists, but we're here just reporting on them,\" he says.The pastor says: \"This is unacceptable, it's shameful. It's shameful to interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship.\" Harmeet Dhillon, of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, said during an interview with podcaster Megyn Kelly on Friday: \"We're going to pursue this to the ends of the Earth.\"The White House appeared to celebrate the arrest, posting a photo of Lemon on its official X account with the caption \"when life gives you lemons\", next to an emoji of chain links.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the detention of Lemon \"shocking\" and \"alarming.\"CNN said it raised \"profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment\". The network said it would follow Lemon's case closely.This is the second high-profile incident this month of the Trump administration investigating a journalist, raising the alarm of free speech advocates. On 14 January, the FBI showed up unannounced to the home of a Washington Post reporter with a search warrant and seized her devices over the alleged leak of classified information, although she herself was not charged with any crime.Protests are continuing in Minnesota, where an operation by federal immigration agents has sparked confrontations that have left two US citizens dead: Renee Good, a mother-of-three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse.",

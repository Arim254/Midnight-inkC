    "body": "Nasry Asfura has been declared the winner of Honduras' razor-thin presidential election, after weeks of delays following technical problems and allegations of fraud. The conservative National Party candidate - backed by US President Donald Trump - won with 40.3% of the vote, according to the National Electoral Council (CNE), edging out Salvador Nasralla of the centre-right Liberal Party, who got 39.5%. In a post on X,  Asfura said: \"Honduras: I am ready to govern. I will not let you down.\" Meanwhile, Nasralla said at a press conference: \"I will not accept a result built on omissions.\" But he also urged his supporters to remain calm.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged all parties to respect the result \"so that Honduran authorities may ensure a peaceful transition of authority\".  But the president of the country's Congress, Luis Redondo, posted saying the result was \"completely illegal\".The vote was held on 30 November but the count was delayed twice by technical outages, which electoral officials called \"inexcusable\".The president of the CNE, Ana Paola Hall, blamed the private company tasked with tabulating the results for the delay.She said the firm had carried out maintenance without warning or checking with the CNE.The stoppage came a day after the portal displaying real-time results had crashed.Results of the election were tight and, because of the tumultuous nature of the processing system, around 15% of the tally sheets had to be counted by hand for the winner to be decided. There have been tensions in Honduras as a result of the delays with protests held across the country last week. Thousands of supporters of the governing Libre party demonstrated in the capital Tegucigalpa over what they considered fraud in the vote.  The outgoing President, Xiomara Castro, had alleged that an \"electoral coup\" was taking place and earlier this month said the election was being marred by \"interference\" from Trump. When he endorsed Asfura for president, Trump said there would be \"hell to pay\" if his very narrow lead was overturned in the count. He also threatened to withdraw financial support from the US if Asfura didn't win.In a surprise move, the US president also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, a member of Asfura's National Party, who was serving a 45-year jail sentence in the US on drug and weapons charges. Castro was barred by the constitution from standing for a second term.Nine days after the vote, Nasralla accused \"corrupt people\" of manipulating the vote count in the Central American nation. He also said Trump's comments had damaged his chances of winning.  In his statement following the announcement of the result, Rubio said the US would \"look forward to working with his incoming administration to advance our bilateral and regional security co-operation\", adding the two countries would \"end illegal immigration\" to the US, while strengthening economic ties.

    "body": "Turkish authorities say they have disrupted planned attacks on Christmas and New Year's events after detaining more than 100 suspected members of the so-called Islamic State group.Mass raids were carried out at 124 addresses across Istanbul, the city's chief prosecutor said, with firearms, ammunition and \"organisational documents\" seized.Officials said IS supporters had been actively planning attacks across Turkey this week, particularly against non-Muslims. Police detained 115 suspects but efforts are ongoing to trace a further 22, an official statement read.The prosecutor's office said the suspects were in contact with IS operatives outside Turkey. The announcement comes two days after Turkish intelligence agents carried out a raid against the group on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.A Turkish national who is alleged to have held a senior role with the IS wing operating in the region was detained and accused of planning attacks against civilians. Turkey's security services regularly target people with suspected links to IS.The country shares a 900km (560 mile) border with Syria, where the group continues to operate in parts of the country.Syria's president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has close ties to the Turkish government, has vowed to work with the US and Europe to root out surviving elements of IS. The US launched a wave of air strikes against the group's positions across Syria on Friday in response to the killing of three Americans.Two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed by IS gunmen during an ambush earlier this month.

    "body": "Tarique Rahman, the front-runner to be the next prime minister of Bangladesh, has returned to the country after 17 years in exile ahead of landmark general elections.The 60-year-old is the figurehead of the influential Zia family and the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. The party he leads, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is eyeing a return to power when Bangladesh goes to the polls in the new year.Rahman, who has lived in London since 2008, is expected to become the country's new leader if the BNP emerges as the largest party. Rahman's return comes in the wake of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year.He had been the subject of various criminal investigations launched while her Awami League party was in power but was cleared of all charges when her regime fell. Hasina is living in exile in India and her party is unlikely to be permitted to take part in the elections, which many view as among the most consequential in Bangladesh's history.Last month, Hasina was sentenced to death for her role in suppressing anti-government protests. According to UN investigators, up to 1,400 people died in the student-led unrest.Hasina, who was put on trial in absentia, has denied committing crimes against humanity. ",

    "body": "1 day agoNomsa MasekoandEmma RossiterEleven suspects have been arrested in connection with a mass shooting that left nine people dead at a tavern in South Africa on Sunday.Police launched a manhunt for the 12 unidentified gunmen who had opened fire at patrons at around 01:00 local time (23:00 GMT Saturday) in the Bekkersdal establishment, near Johannesburg.On Wednesday, provincial deputy commissioner of police, Major General Fred Kekana said nine of the arrested suspects are Lesotho nationals, while one is from Mozambique.Another suspect, believed to be a South African mineworker, was also detained.Murders in South Africa – which has one of the highest rates in the world - are often the result of arguments, robberies and gang violence.While the attack appeared \"unprovoked\" at the time, preliminary investigations now appear to suggest a motive linked to illegal mining turf wars.During the attack, gunmen continued to shoot as people fled the tavern, killing two as well as a taxi driver who had dropped off a passenger nearby.Upon making the arrests, several unlicensed firearms including an AK-47 rifle, were found in the suspects' possession.There are about 3m legally held firearms in South Africa and at least the same number of unlicensed weapons, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association, Although 2025 has seen a decline in reported mass shootings, there has been a significant increase in incidents where four or more people are either killed or injured since 2020, Claire Taylor, a researcher at campaign group Gun Free South Africa, told the BBC.Among the most common locations for these attacks are licensed taverns or illegal drinking spots, known locally as shebeens.Sunday's shooting occurred just two weeks after another attack at the Saulsville Hostel in the capital Pretoria, where eleven people including a three-year-old child were killed.",

Unverified footage on social media appears to show the aftermath of the explosion, with people standing in a market area with dust particles in the air. No group has admitted carrying out the attack, but militants have previously targeted mosques and crowded places in the area with suicide attacks and improvised explosive devices (IED).Maiduguri has been central to an insurgency by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province. Military operations by Boko Haram to create an Islamic caliphate in Borno state began in 2009. Security measures against the group have failed to prevent sporadic attacks against civilians in north-east Nigeria. ",

    "body": "The jailed ex-president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a successful surgery for a double hernia, his wife Michelle says. The former leader is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazil's Supreme Court granted permission for the 70-year-old to be transferred from the room in the federal police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to a hospital in the capital, Brasília, for the procedure. Ahead of the surgery, Jair Bolsonaro endorsed the candidacy of his eldest son, Flávio, for the 2026 presidential race. The former president made his decision known in handwritten letter that was read out by Flávio Bolsonaro outside the hospital were his father is being treated.\"During my life, I have fought tough battles, paying a high price with both my health and my family, to defend what I think is best for our country,\" Bolsonaro wrote.\"I hand over what is most important in the life of a father - my own son for the mission of rescuing our country, Brazil.\"Flávio Bolsonaro, a 44-year-old senator, had already announced his decision to run for president for his father's Liberal Party.Ealier this month, he said his father had entrusted him \"with the mission of continuing our national project\". But Jair Bolsonaro's letter, which has been published by Brazilian media, is confirmation the senator has his father's backing.The incumbent, President Lula, has already announced he plans to run again in the presidential election scheduled for October 2026. In 2022, the presidential election went into a run-off, which saw the older Bolsonaro take on ex-President Lula. When Lula narrowly won, Jair Bolsonaro refused to accept the result and plotted with top military leaders to prevent Lula from taking up office. While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023.Bolsonaro was found guilty of coup-plotting and sentenced in September this year. Despite the guilty verdict, the older Bolsonaro still wields considerable political influence.Brazil's Congress passed a bill last week to significantly shorten Bolsonaro's sentence but President Lula said he would veto it.  Jair Bolsonaro is expected to be transferred back to federal police headquarters as soon as doctors give the go-ahead. ",

    "body": "Pope Leo has urged Ukraine and Russia to find the \"courage\" to hold direct talks to end the war during his first Christmas remarks to crowds in St Peter's square.He called for an end to conflicts around the world during his Urbi et Orbi address, which is traditionally delivered by the pontiff on Christmas Day to worshippers gathered in Vatican City. Speaking about Ukraine, the Pope said: \"May the clamour of weapons cease, and may the parties involved, with the support and commitment of the international community, find the courage to engage in sincere, direct and respectful dialogue.\"His plea comes as US-led negotiations on a deal to end the fighting continues. The US has sought to put together an agreement acceptable to both sides, but direct talks between Russian and Ukraine have not taken place during this latest round of diplomatic efforts.Pope Leo also decried turmoil and conflict plaguing other parts of the world, including Thailand and Cambodia where deadly border clashes have flared up despite a ceasefire in July.He asked that the South East Asian nations' \"ancient friendship\" be restored and \"to work towards reconciliation and peace\".During an earlier Christmas Day sermon in St Peter's Basilica, Pope Leo lamented conditions for homeless people the world over, and the damage caused by conflicts.\"Fragile is the flesh of defenceless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds,\" he said.He said the story of the birth of Jesus showed that God had \"pitched his fragile tent\" among the people of the world. \"How, then,\" he asked, turning his attention to the conditions of Palestinians, \"can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?\"Gaza has been devastated by Israeli bombardment in a two-year war, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.Winter storms have compounded the plight of the territory's 2.1m population, nearly all of whom have been displaced and their homes damaged or destroyed.Aid agencies have called for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza. Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's border crossings, has dismissed claims of deliberate aid restrictions, saying almost 310,000 tents and tarpaulins had been delivered since the start of the ceasefire in October.",

    "body": "3 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterandJaroslav LukivUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has given a positive assessment of a conversation he had with US envoys on how to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Zelensky said Thursday's call with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, which lasted nearly an hour, had yielded \"new ideas in terms of formats, meetings, and... timing on how to bring a real peace closer\".He spoke a day after giving details of an updated 20-point peace plan, agreed by US and Ukrainian envoys in Florida. Zelensky said he had asked Witkoff and Kushner to pass along Christmas greetings to US President Donald Trump \"and the entire Trump family\".The Kremlin said it was analysing proposals brought back from the US by a Russian envoy.Trump and his envoys have been holding talks with both Ukraine and Russia in an effort to reach a deal to end the war which was started by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.There appears to have been some progress in recent days with Ukraine's president praising the \"good ideas\" put forward by Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Kushner.Zelensky said it had been an \"active day\" for his country's diplomacy, as he went into details with the US envoys.He conceded that there was still \"work to be done on sensitive issues\" but added that \"together with the American team, we understand how to put all of this in place\".Zelensky added that Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov, the country's top security official, \"will continue discussions with the American team\".The 20-point peace plan agreed by the US and Ukraine is seen as an update to the  initial draft prepared by Witkoff several weeks ago.That draft was widely seen as heavily geared towards Russia's maximalist pre-invasion demands, which Kyiv and its European said meant the de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Describing the updated proposal on Wednesday, Zelensky had said it offered Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarised zone in their place.He said the plan now included security guarantees from the US, Nato and Europeans for a co-ordinated military response if Russia invaded Ukraine again.On the key question of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donetsk region, Zelensky said a \"free economic zone\" was a potential option. Any area that Ukrainian troops pulled out of would have to be policed by Ukraine, he stressed.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. They are collectively known as Donbas.Zelensky has been under heavy pressure from Trump to cede all of Donbas to Russia during ongoing Washington-led peace negotiations.The Ukrainian leader has so far rejected any territorial concessions, and instead demanded iron-clad security guarantees for Ukraine in any potential settlement.Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must leave Donbas or Russia will seize it.On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was studying the proposals brought back from the US by the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.\"We are examining this material, and depending on the decisions made by the head of state, we will continue our communication with the Americans,\" he said.While diplomatic efforts to end the conflict inch forward, fighting continues on the ground. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that it had struck one of Russia's key oil refineries in the southern region of Rostov with cruise missiles. The Novoshakhtinsk refinery near the Ukrainian border is critical for supplying fuel for Russian military operations in occupied eastern Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry said its forces had taken control of the settlement of Sviato-Pokrovske in the Donetsk region.Earlier this week, Ukrainian troops withdrew from the embattled eastern town of Siversk.The capture of the town brings Russia closer to the last remaining \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk still in Ukrainian hands in the Donetsk region.",

    "body": "Heavy rain storms across large parts of California triggered floods and mudslides and left three dead as of Christmas night, according to local officials. The storms - which were expected to continue through Friday - brought 11 inches (27 cms) of rainfall to some parts of Los Angeles County, prompted evacuations and shut down major roads. Emergency responders have had to perform several rescues,  including people stuck in vehicles as flood waters rise.  California's Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Wednesday in Los Angeles and other southern California counties. About 100,000 people in the state were without power as of Thursday evening. The US Weather Prediction Center said on Thursday that \"Numerous flash flooding events are possible\". \"In addition, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.\" A 64-year-old man from San Diego, California, was killed on Wedesday morning by a fallen tree, the police department told US media. Another person, a 74-year-old, died from flood waters over the weekend as police tried to rescue him from inside a vehicle in Redding, California, the town's mayor told local news. And on Monday, a woman in her 70s died after she \"was knocked off a rock by a large wave and swept into the ocean\" at MacKerricher State Park in Mendocino County, California, the sheriff's office said in a statement. Evacuation warnings were in effect for some residents of San Bernardino County in southern California, and flash food warnings were issued for those in the San Francisco Bay area on Thursday morning. Wind speeds in the Bay Area topped 100 mph (161kmh) at one observatory near San Jose, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.In Altadena, near Los Angeles, residents experienced a mudslide from flooding in a burn scar area that was less able to absorb water due to the wildfires that scorched the neighbourhood in January of this year, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has also declared an emergency from the storms and warned residents to be cautious on roads during a time of busy holiday travel. \"I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel,\" she said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Please do not take this storm lightly.\"The storms came from multiple atmospheric rivers that carried large plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, CBS News reported.",

    "body": "Two British campaigners are among five people denied US visas after the State Department accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" American tech platforms into suppressing free speech.Imran Ahmed, an ex-Labour adviser who now heads the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), and Clare Melford, CEO of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), were labelled \"radical activists\" by the Trump administration and banned from entering the US.A French ex-EU commissioner and two senior figures at a Germany-based anti-online hate group were also denied visas.European leaders have condemned the measures, while the UK government said it is \"fully committed\" to upholding free speech.\"While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content,\" a UK government spokesperson said.French President Emmanuel Macron described the travel ban as \"intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty\" while the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"unacceptable and an attempt to challenge our sovereignty\".The US billed the measures as a response to people and organisations that have campaigned for restrictions on American tech firms, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying they belonged to a \"global censorship-industrial complex\".He said: \"President Trump has been clear that his America First foreign policy rejects violations of American sovereignty. Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception.\"Ahmed from the CCDH, which says it advocates for government action against hate speech and disinformation online, has links to senior Labour figures. He was previously an aide to Labour minister Hilary Benn, and Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has served as a director of the group he founded.The US government labelled Ahmed a \"collaborator\" for the CCDH's purported past work with the Biden administration. BBC News has contacted the CCDH for comment.Melford founded the GDI, a non-profit that monitors the spread of disinformation, in 2018.US Undersecretary of State Sarah B Rogers accused the GDI of using US taxpayer money \"to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press\". A GDI spokesperson told the BBC that \"the visa sanctions announced today are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\".\"The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\"Also targeted was Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, who suggested that a \"witch hunt\" was taking place.Breton was described by the State Department as the \"mastermind\" of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation on social media firms. However, it has angered some US conservatives who see it as seeking to censor right-wing opinions. Brussels denies this.Breton has clashed with Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of X, over obligations to follow EU rules.The European Commission recently fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges - the first fine under the DSA. It said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".In response, Musk's site blocked the Commission from sharing adverts on its platform.Reacting to the visa ban, Breton posted on X: \"To our American friends: Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"Also subject to bans were Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organisation that the State Department said helped enforce the DSA.In a statement to the BBC, the two CEOs called it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary\". They added: \"We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Democratic US Representative Joyce Beatty has filed a lawsuit seeking to remove President Donald Trump's name from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was illegal because changing the name requires \"an act of Congress\". The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. Beatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a \"living memorial\" to former President Kennedy. \"[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump,\" the lawsuit states.In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had \"stepped up\" and saved the Kennedy Center \"by strengthening its finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke programming\". \"As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America's most iconic cultural institutions,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. On Friday, the president's name was added to the exterior of the building, and the centre's website logo now reads \"The Trump Kennedy Center\".The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for Kennedy.Musician Chuck Redd cancelled his annual Christmas Eve jazz concert at the centre, a tradition spanning nearly two decades, in response to the renaming.\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press on Wednesday. Redd has been hosting the annual Christmas Eve \"Jazz Jams\"at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.The Kennedy Center's website lists the show as cancelled.Construction began on a performing arts centre in the 1950s and after Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to name it after him.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired a slew of the centre's board members and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make him chairman of the board. His close adviser Richard Grenell became board president.The centre's board of trustees currently has 34 members appointed by Trump and 23 others designated as members by US law, according to the centre's website. Trump also secured about $257m (£190m) in congressional funding to pay for major renovations and other costs at the venue, saying it was in \"bad shape\". Several members of the Kennedy family took to social media to criticise the name change. Joe Kennedy III, a former House member and grandnephew of the late president, said that \"the Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".\"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he added.",

    "body": "Algeria's parliament has unanimously passed a law declaring France's colonisation of the North African state a crime, and demanding an apology and reparations. The law also criminalises the glorification of colonialism, state-run TV reports.The vote is the latest sign of increasingly strained diplomatic relations between the two countries, with some observers saying they are at their lowest since Algeria gained independence 63 years ago.France's colonisation of Algeria between 1830 and 1962 was marked by mass killings, large-scale deportations and ended in a bloody war of independence. Algeria says the war killed 1.5 million people, while French historians put the death toll much lower.France's President Emmanuel Macron has previously acknowledged the colonisation of Algeria was a \"crime against humanity\" but has not offered an apology.Lawmakers wore scarves in the colours of the national flag and chanted \"long live Algeria\" as they applauded the bill's passage through parliament, AFP news agency reports.It says the legislation states that France has \"legal responsibility\" for the \"tragedies it caused\", and \"full and fair\" compensation was an \"inalienable right of the Algerian state and people\". France has not yet commented on the vote. It comes at a time of growing pressure on Western powers to offer reparations for slavery and colonialism, and to return looted artefacts still kept in their museums.Algerian lawmakers have been demanding that France return a 16th Century bronze canon, known as Baba Merzoug, meaning \"Blessed Father\", that was regarded as the protector of Algiers, now Algeria's capital.French forces captured the city in 1830, on their third attempt, and removed the cannon - which is now in the port city of Brest in north-western France.In 2020, France returned the remains of 24 Algerian fighters who were killed resisting French colonial forces in the 19th Century.Last month, Algeria hosted a conference of African states to push for justice and reparations.Algeria's Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said that a legal framework would ensure that restitution was neither regarded as \"a gift nor a favour\".Diplomatic relations between between Algeria and France soured last year, when Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal was then arrested at Algiers airport in  and jailed for five years, before being pardoned by Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune last month.Prosecutors said he had undermined national security for making remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.",

    "description": "US authorities have discovered more than a million more documents potentially related to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein that they plan to release",
    "body": "US authorities have discovered more than a million more documents potentially related to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein that they plan to release in the coming days and weeks, officials say.The FBI and federal prosecutors in New York informed the Department of Justice (DoJ) of the discovery.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,\" the DoJ said on Wednesday.The department said it could take \"a few more weeks\" before all the files are released. The DoJ has been under scrutiny after not releasing all Epstein files by 19 December, the deadline mandated under a new law.The agency said it would \"continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump's direction to release the files\". The statement did not specify how the FBI and the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York came across the additional material. Epstein had been facing charges of sex trafficking minors in the state when he died awaiting trial in a New York prison. The news comes after the justice department released thousands of documents - some heavily redacted - related to their investigations into Epstein. The department has been releasing the documents in batches and top officials have said hundreds of thousands of documents still are to be released. Who and what are in the Epstein files?Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The disgraced financier with powerful associatesTrump trips, a fake video and 10 possible co-conspirators: Takeaways from new Epstein filesThe files were released after Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act - signed into law by US President Donald Trump - that ordered the agency to share all the documents with the public while protecting victims' identities. Many of the released documents, which include videos, photos, emails and investigative documents, have heavy redactions, including names of people the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case.The justice department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations. In a post on X after the discovery of the additional documents was announced, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, a congressional panel that has been investigating the Epstein saga, accused the White House of “illegally” withholding the files.“Every day we see lies, incompetence, missed deadlines, and illegal redactions,” Representative Robert Garcia said in a statement. The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".Included in the documents are emails appearing to be exchanged between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein.The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the justice department.Previous releases of Epstein documents have included revelations that reverberated across the Atlantic. Andrew and Epstein is the story that will not go awayAndrew stripped of 'prince' title and will move out of Royal LodgePeter Mandelson: Rise and fall of Labour's political fixerPeter Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US after details emerged about his friendship with the convicted paedophile, and that he told Epstein \"I think the world of you\", the day before Epstein began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008.Lord Mandelson said in a letter to staff that \"I deeply regret\" the circumstances of his departure from the British embassy in Washington DC. He said being ambassador had been \"the privilege of my life\" and he continued \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein twenty years ago and the plight of his victims\".In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost his prince title and was asked to leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following prolonged scrutiny over his links to Epstein. In the latest release of files on Tuesday, a 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" from \"Balmoral\" to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell - who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences- asks: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\"The BBC has contacted Andrew's team for a response. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".",

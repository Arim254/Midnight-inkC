    "body": "The head of Britain's richest family, Gopichand Hinduja, has died aged 85.Known as GP, Mr Hinduja and his family made their fortune from the Indian conglomerate Hinduja Group, which operates in 11 sectors including finance, media and entertainment, and oil.It has about 200,000 staff around the world.The family said in a statement: \"He will leave a deep hole at the heart of our family.\"They added that he would be \"remembered for his formidable work\".Mr Hinduja helped transform his father's modest textile and trading businesses into a global conglomerate and one of India's largest companies.Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer, said he would be remembered as someone who \"personified\" the links between India and the UK.\"Whether it was in banking, whether it was in manufacturing, whether it was in property, they were always putting the UK and India together\"GP was not only a famous and respected individual in the UK and India but a great champion for our two countries. We shall miss him greatly.\"Mr Hinduja and his family topped the most recent Sunday Times Rich List with a net worth of £35.3bn. They also ranked 11th on the Forbes list of India's 100 richest businesspeople in 2024.Mr Hinduja was the second eldest of four brothers who controlled the business for decades.The oldest of the four, Srichand, died in 2023 at 87.It is not known who will now take over the leadership of the conglomerate. The youngest brother, Ashok, runs its operations across India including truck maker Ashok Leyland.The Hinduja conglomerate operates in 48 countries.The family also own significant real estate in London, including a number of large homes near to St James's Park and Winston Churchill's Old War Office in Whitehall, which has recently been refurbished to include a hotel.Mr Hinduja largely kept out of the public eye but was involved in the controversial \"Hinduja affair\" in 2001.Mr Hinduja had written to then- government minister Peter Mandelson about his brother Prakash obtaining British citizenship, after the family's charity had donated £1m to the Millennium Dome, for which Mandelson was responsible.Mandelson resigned as a minister as a result, but was later cleared of wrongdoing after an inquiry. Prakash, his wife, their son and his wife were jailed by a Swiss court last year for exploiting domestic staff in their Geneva mansion.",

    "body": "58 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterOnline retailers Shein, Temu, AliExpress and Wish are being investigated in France in relation to the offence of enabling minors to access pornographic content on their platforms, the Paris prosecutor said on Tuesday.The country's consumer watchdog had reported the four firms to the prosecution service on Sunday after raising concerns about the sale of childlike sex dolls on Shein's platform over the weekend.In an earlier statement, Shein said it would cooperate fully with authorities and is willing to provide information on sellers, buyers and products involved. When contacted on Wednesday, it did not have further comments to add.AliExpress told the BBC it takes the matter very seriously.Temu and Wish have also been contacted for comment.The Paris prosecutor's office said the four platforms are being investigated over violent, pornographic or \"undignified messages\" that can be accessed by minors.Shein and AliExpress are also under investigation over the dissemination of content related to children that are of a pornographic nature, the prosecutor's office said.The cases have been referred to Paris' Office des Mineurs, the prosecution service added. The office is an arm of the French police force that oversees the protection of minors.AliExpress said the listings in question violated its policies and were removed once it became aware of them.\"Sellers found to violate or trying to circumvent these requirements will be penalised in accordance with our rules,\" AliExpress said in a statement.On Monday, Shein said it had banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform worldwide. The Singapore-based retailer also said that it would permanently block all seller accounts related to the illegal sale of the childlike dolls and set stricter controls on its platform.The French consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, had said the sex dolls' description and categorisation left \"little doubt as to the child pornography nature\" of the products.The scrutiny of Shein comes as the company, which was founded in China, prepares for the opening on Wednesday of its first permanent physical outlet in France.Protesters have been seen gathered in front of the Paris department store where Shein is set to open the outlet.Shein plans to open outlets in other French department stores in cities including Dijon, Reims and Angers.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesReddit is one of the latest platforms to be added to Australia's social media banPopular forum site Reddit has been added to Australia's world-first social media ban for children under 16 that starts next month.Live-streaming platform Kick will also be included, bringing the number of sites targeted in the ban to nine. They include Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Threads.From 10 December, tech companies can be fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to deactivate existing accounts for under-16s and prohibit new ones.Each banned platform was chosen as their \"sole or a significant purpose is to enable online social interaction,\" the government said, and more sites may be added given the \"fast-changing\" nature of technology.\"Delaying children's access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,\" said Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant.Messaging services Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms Lego Play and Roblox will not be included, nor will Google Classroom and YouTube Kids.Federal Communications Minister Anika Wells said the online platforms can target children with \"chilling control\" and the ban was about protecting children.\"We aren't chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference,\" she said.It is unclear how companies will implement the ban - which is being closely watched by global leaders - but some of the potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology. Critics have raised concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software, with a recent report showing the proposed methods all have risks or shortcomings. Most Australian adults support the ban, according to polls, but some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.Instead, they say, the government should focus on better policing of harmful content on social media platforms and prepare children for the reality of life on the web.An Australian influencer family who have millions of YouTube follower recently announced their decision to move to the UK to avoid the upcoming ban, namely so their 14-year-old daughter can continue to create online content.YouTube was initially exempt from the ban but in July, the government reversed its decision, saying the video sharing site was \"the most frequently cited platform\" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw \"harmful content\".Teens under 16 will still be able to view YouTube videos but will not be permitted to have an account, which is required for uploading content or interacting on the platform.",

    "body": "Israel has confirmed the latest body of a hostage returned by Hamas via the Red Cross is that of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen.The 19-year-old's remains were handed over on Tuesday as part of a Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by US President Donald Trump last month.\"Following the completion of the identification process... [Israel Defense Forces] representatives informed the family of the fallen hostage, Staff Sergeant Itay Chen, that their loved one has been returned to Israel and positively identified,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said.Earlier, Hamas's military wing said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.Israel had allowed members of the Palestinian armed group and Red Cross staff to search for the remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.Staff Sgt Chen was serving as a soldier in the IDF's 7th Brigade when Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023. The IDF said he was killed inside a tank during a battle in Kibbutz Nir Oz and that his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage by Hamas.\"The remains of Itay Chen, a young American taken hostage by Hamas at just 19 years old, have finally returned home. We honour his life, mourn his loss, and stand with his family,\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel welcomed his returned but also stressed that there were seven deceased hostages still in Gaza. \"Please don't stop until they are all back home. Until the last hostage,\" it said.The Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages since the ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October.Hamas has insisted it is difficult to locate the bodies under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Trump's Gaza peace plan, including plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.The US has now reportedly drafted a UN Security Council resolution that would give a two-year mandate for a transitional governance body in Gaza, known as the Board of Peace, and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF). The text says the ISF would be tasked with working with Israel and Egypt to secure border areas, \"ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip\", protecting civilians, and training a new Palestinian police force. It also says the ISF would be authorised to \"use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\". It is understood the draft has not yet been formally sent to other Security Council members for negotiations.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 270 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 18 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas before Tuesday, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese. The bodies of another 15 Palestinians are expected to be returned to Gaza in exchange for Sgt Chen.Five of the seven dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a hospital official in Gaza City said a man was killed by Israeli fire in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza.The Israeli military said its troops killed a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory, and posed a threat to them.",

    "body": "8 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, OttawaCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has put forward his first federal budget, which lays out an ambitious plan to transform Canada's economy and deal with the challenge of US tariffs.Billed an \"investment budget\" by the government, the fiscal plan increases Canada's deficit to C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), the second largest in history. The spending is offset by plans to attract C$1tn of investment into Canada over the next five years, with the federal government arguing more restrained spending would eliminate \"vital social programmes\" and funding for Canada's future. The budget does outline cuts, however, including slashing the size of the federal workforce by some 10% in the coming years. The budget was presented by Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, in the House of Commons late on Tuesday afternoon. In his budget speech, Champagne warned that Canada is facing \"a time of profound change\" and that \"bold and swift action is needed\" to ensure the country prospers.Peppered throughout the budget are references to uncertainty and the need for protectionist measures as a result of US tariffs on Canada. President Donald Trump has placed a broad 35% levy on Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, and has tariffed specific sectors like steel, aluminium and automobiles. These levies, enacted earlier this year, have already led to Canadian job losses in those sectors, and business leaders have warned of a chill on investment in Canada due to trade uncertainty. To counter this, the budget proposes spending of C$280bn over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\". These include updating ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade, as well as direct financing to support firms impacted by tariffs.The fiscal update also outlines a plan to boost Canada's competitiveness, with the goal of making Canada a more attractive place to do business than the US.Rebekah Young, the head of inclusion and resilience economics at Scotiabank, said the budget lays out a plan to reduce timelines and smooth regulatory hurdles with the hopes that it will boost private investment in Canada over the years.But she cautioned that parts of the budget might be a hard sell for Canadians struggling immediately with the cost of living.\"They're going to open this budget and not see any new (supports),\" she said. And while the budget delivers on its promise of generational spending, Ms Young said it remains to be seen if it will be as \"transformational\" as Carney hopes.\"We want to unlock a trillion dollars based on this investment here. A lot has to happen to get to that trillion,\" she said. On defence, the budget pledges nearly C$82bn over five years—the largest funding in decades—putting Canada in line with its Nato commitment to spend 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on its military by this year.The Carney government is also betting big on AI, proposing nearly C$1bn to boost integration and use of the rapidly growing technology, including in government operations.Carney warned Canadians ahead of the budget of \"sacrifices\". Among them is a reduction of the size of the federal government that would result in 40,000 job losses by 2029. International aid is also slated to be cut to pre-pandemic levels. Immigration targets have been lowered slightly over the next three years to \"stabilise\" new admissions to the country, including a significant cut to student visas.The budget will need to be passed by Canada's parliament before it's implemented. Carney's Liberal government is just shy of a majority, meaning it will need the support of other parties to enact its fiscal plan. Failure to pass the budget could risk a federal election. One Conservative MP, Chris d'Entremont, said in a statement released by the Liberals on Tuesday night that he had resigned from the Conservative caucus and will be crossing the floor to Carney’s party.In the statement, the MP said that the  budget “hits the priorities I have heard most in my riding“.​​This narrows Carney's razor-thin minority at a critical time.Meanwhile, Conservative opposition MPs have criticised the budget for increasing Canada's deficit while doing little to address affordability for Canadians. Yves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois party, said his caucus does not see how they could support the budget. Members of the left-leaning New Democratic Party said they will take the time to study it, but have criticised planned public sector cuts. With the projected larger deficit, Carney's fiscal plan maintains that Canada's still has the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the G7, behind only Japan.",

Twenty-six others are missing, a civil defence official said in a radio interview on Wednesday.Videos show people sheltering on rooftops, while cars and shipping containers have been swept through the streets.The official death toll includes six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island, south of Cebu, after it was deployed to assist in relief efforts.The aircraft went down on Tuesday near Agusan del Sur and was one of four sent to help.\"Communication with the helicopter was lost, which immediately prompted the launch of a search and rescue operation,\" the Philippine Air Force said. Later, a spokeswoman said six bodies had been recovered, believed to be of the pilot and crew.The typhoon, locally named Tino, has weakened since making landfall early on Tuesday, but has continued to bring winds of more than 80mph (130km/h).It is forecast to move across the Visayas islands region and out over the South China Sea by Wednesday.But residents across Cebu province are still reeling from the deadly floods. More than 400,000 people have been displaced by the disaster, according to a report on Wednesday by the national disaster agency.Jel-an Moira Servas, a business owner who lives in Mandaue city, told the BBC that she found herself waist-deep in water within minutes when her house became flooded. She quickly evacuated with her family, bringing only light items like food and electronics.\"Right now, the rain has completely stopped and the sun is out, but our houses are still filled with mud, and everything inside is in shambles,\" she said. \"We don't even know where to start cleaning. I can't even look at it without crying.\"Jel-an Moira ServasJel-an Moira Servas's home in Mandaue city was damaged by heavy flooding during the typhoonRafaelito Alejandro, the deputy administrator at the Office of Civil Defence told local radio station DZMM that the current challenge for rescuers was clearing \"debris and cars on the road\". Carlos Jose Lañas, a volunteer rescuer, told the BBC that despite preparing for the worst case, they were caught off-guard by the extent of the flooding. \"This is the worst flood I've ever experienced,\" the 19-year-old said. \"Almost all the rivers here in Cebu overflowed. Even emergency responders did not expect this kind of scenario.\"\"The rescue operation was too overwhelming for the emergency responders around Cebu, because there were a lot of people asking for help.\"In a Facebook post, Cebu governor Pamela Baricuatro described the disaster as \"unprecedented\".\"We were expecting the winds to be the dangerous part, but... the water is what's truly putting our people at risk,\" she said. \"The floodwaters are just devastating.\"Baricuatro declared a state of calamity in Cebu on Tuesday evening to facilitate disaster relief efforts.Most of the deaths were due to drowning, reports said. The storm has been sending torrents of muddy water down hillsides and into towns and cities.Damage to residential areas on Cebu was extensive, with many small buildings swept away and a thick carpet of mud left by the retreating floodwaters. Rescue teams took to boats to free people who were trapped inside their houses.Don del Rosario, 28, was among those in Cebu City who sought refuge on an upper floor as the storm raged.\"I've been here for 28 years, and this is by far the worst we've experienced,\" he told the AFP news agency.AFP via Getty ImagesMost of the deaths from the storm have happened on the entral island of CebuThe Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year.The latest comes barely a month after back-to-back typhoons killed over a dozen people and wrought damage to infrastructure and crops.Super Typhoon Ragasa, known locally as Nando, struck in late September, followed swiftly by Typhoon Bualoi, known locally as Opong.In the months before, an extraordinarily wet monsoon season caused widespread flooding, sparking anger and protests over unfinished and sub-standard flood control systems that have been blamed on corruption.On 30 September, dozens were killed and injured after a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines, with Cebu bearing the brunt of the damage.Typhoon Kalmaegi is forecast to move on to Vietnam, which is already seeing record-breaking rainfall.With additional reporting by Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent",

    "body": "'Mandate for change': Zohran Mamdani wins New York City mayoral election3 hours agoMadeline HalpertNew York CityREUTERS/Jeenah MoonZohran Mamdani, 34, has won New York City's race for mayor in a contest that rallied young voters and sparked debate about the future direction of the Democratic Party. The Ugandan-born Mamdani, a Democrat, beat former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, to become the youngest person in over a century to lead the largest city in the US. \"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" he told the crowd during a victory speech, touting voters' \"mandate for change\" and \"mandate for a city we can afford\".A self-described democratic socialist, he made affordability the central message of his campaign, pledging to expand social programmes paid for by new taxes on high earners and corporations.Democrats also won governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, and in California voters backed a proposition to redraw the congressional electoral map ahead of next year's midterm elections. In New York, Mamdani was a relatively unknown member of the state assembly until his campaign gained online momentum a few months ago, propelling him to victory in the Democratic primary contest over the summer.Follow live coverage hereMamdani seals remarkable victory - but real challenges awaitIn projections from BBC news partner CBS, Mamdani had secured 50.3% of the vote, compared with Cuomo's 41.6%. Republican Curtis Sliwa had just over 7%. Shortly after the winner was projected, Sliwa conceded.\"We have a mayor-elect,\" Sliwa told a group of supporters. \"Obviously I wish him good luck, because if he does well, we do well.\"Cuomo also conceded, congratulating Mamdani to a chorus of boos from his supporters. \"That is not right,\" he chided.\"Tonight was their night. Our city is the greatest city in the world and we will unite for New York City because we love New York City,\" he said, pledging to help the new administration.It is a historic moment as Mamdani also becomes the first South Asian and Muslim to lead the city. In victory, he spoke of a \"new age\".\"For as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well-connected that power does not belong in their hands,\" Mamdani said. \"The future is in our hands,\" he said, pledging to create a government that works \"for everyone\".But Mamdani's campaign has drawn significant national attention, including from US President Donald Trump, who in the days before the vote threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani, whom he called a communist, won.REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThere are questions over how he will pay for his ambitious social agenda and critics have questioned how a politician with no executive experience will handle a hostile Trump administration.On Tuesday night, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson criticised on X  the \"consequences\" of New York City's choice. \"Zohran Mamdani's election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party,\" he wrote.The president also posted on social media, blaming the shutdown, and his not appearing on the ballot, for Republican losses Tuesday night. Centrist Democrats clinched victories in elections for governor on Tuesday night, with US Representative Abigail Spanberger and US Representative Mikie Sherrill winning races to run the states of Virginia and New Jersey respectively.Voters in California approved a measure to redraw political lines to favour Democrats, in response to similar efforts by conservative-led states in a nationwide battle for control of the US House of Representatives.Democrat Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor raceCalifornia voters approve redistrictingMamdani's win also presents a dilemma for the Democratic establishment, which has been reluctant to endorse him. Despite that, he was favored to win New York City's election, leading Cuomo and Sliwa in the polls by double digits for weeks leading up to Election Day. A relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his rise, from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to the frontrunner to lead a city with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.The former New York assemblyman centred his campaign on affordability in one of the country's most expensive cities, campaigning on issues like universal child care, and free and faster buses. His candidacy drew criticism from business leaders and centrist Democrats, some of whom did not endorse him, including fellow New Yorker and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans have seized on his expected win to paint the future of the Democratic Party as a party of socialism. President Donald Trump has repeatedly lambasted Mamdani and threatened to withold federal funding from the city if he wins. Still, Mamdani won even after New York Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race after several scandals, which was expected to boost Cuomo's candidacy. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoGeeta Pandey,BBC News, Delhi and Ashraf Padanna,ThiruvananthapuramVivek NairAt the centre of the current controversy are the two gold-clad idols of door guards seen in this photo. They are placed outside the temple's main chamber  A famed Hindu temple in southern India is embroiled in a scandal after the Kerala high court said there was evidence that some of the idols have been stripped of their gold covering.Gold and silver plating of idols and temple figurines, mostly paid for by devotees, is common across temples in India. So, the theft at Sabarimala shrine, visited by millions of pilgrims every year, has stunned the devout and made headlines.The Kerala High Court has set up a special investigation team (SIT), police have begun an inquiry into the disappearance of gold and three people, including a former assistant temple priest, have been arrested.A two-judge bench that is monitoring the investigation has been holding regular hearings in the case since September and the next sitting is on Wednesday.The hill shrine, dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Ayyappa, had made headlines a few years back too. The temple bars women of menstruating age and was ordered by the Supreme Court to end this discrimination. But following protests, the court agreed to review its landmark ruling and put it on hold. The Sabarimala shrine is visited by millions of pilgrims every yearWhat has been stolen?The current controversy centres around two idols of Dwarapalakas - or the door guards that stand just outside the sanctum sanctorum where the main deity sits.The court took up the case in September after a report by the court-appointed Sabarimala Special Commissioner revealed that the idols were stripped of their gold-cladding in many places.In a series of court orders since then, Justices Raja Vijayaraghavan V and KV Jayakumar say they have looked at the records submitted by temple officials, before-and-after photographs and other documents that the SIT has gathered into \"this extraordinary case involving the pilferage of Lord Ayyappa's sacred valuables\".The judges said when they directed the temple officials to produce complete files and records relating to the repair of the idols, \"little did we realise, that we were in fact opening a hornet's nest\".Temple records show that 30.291kg gold - donated by now-disgraced billionaire businessman Vijay Mallya - was used in 1998-99 to carry out gold-cladding on the idols and several parts of the temple, including some pillars, door arches and panels depicting stories of Lord Ayyappa.The court says that in July 2019, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) that manages the temple allowed the main suspect Unnikrishnan Potty - a former assistant priest at Sabarimala - to take out the idols for fresh gold-cladding.Two months later when they were brought back, they were not weighed, but the court says that later investigations have revealed they were a lot lighter. Further investigation by the SIT has revealed pilferage also from the pedestals and door frames and the court says that approximately 4.54kg gold has gone missing since 2019.\"A heist and plundering of gold\" - that's how the judges have described the case of the missing gold.The temple does not allow women of menstruating age so only young girls or elderly female pilgrims can visit the shrineWhat was highly unusual was that Mr Potty was allowed to take out the idols since repair work is generally done within the temple, the court noted. It added that \"while handing over the precious items to him\", the temple board had recorded gold-cladded items as \"copper plates\".The judges have also been scathing in their criticism of the temple board for \"wrongfully permitting \" Mr Potty \"to retain approximately 474.9g of gold\" after the repairs.Referring to an email Mr Potty sent to the board seeking permission to use this \"surplus gold\" for the \"marriage of a girl known or related to him\", the court said it was \"deeply disturbing and exposes, yet again, the extent of the impropriety involved\".Sabarimala is among the most popular Hindu temples in IndiaThe suspects and their denialsMr Potty has been arrested and sent to judicial custody by a magistrate and the BBC has not been able to speak to himBut on his way out from the court after his arrest, he shouted at the throng of waiting reporters that he was being \"trapped\".\"The truth will come out. Those who trapped me in this will face the law. Everything will be revealed,\" he said.In the past few days, police have also arrested two board officials. The board's president PS Prasanth, who is also under investigation, did not respond to calls or messages from the BBC.Earlier, he told reporters that \"the current board had nothing to do with the issue\" but added that he was \"fully cooperating with the investigation\" and \"hoped that all culprits would be brought to justice\".The SIT has been given six weeks to complete its investigation and the court has vowed \"to identify and bring to book every person culpable in the matter… irrespective of the position, influence or status of the person\".KB JAYACHANDRANOpposition legislators have protested outside the state assembly against the gold theftPolitical row and protestsThe scandal has also led to a political row in the state with opposition parties holding protests against Kerala's Communist government.\"About 5kg of gold has been stolen,\" Congress party's VD Satheesan, who is the leader of the opposition in the state legislative assembly, told the BBC. \"The court has expressed shock and observed that the officials are equally, if not more, culpable in the matter.\"Satheesan and other opposition politicians have demanded that the state's Minister for Temple Affairs VN Vasavan take responsibility for the failure to protect the god's valuables and resign.Vasavan has denied the allegations and rejected the opposition's call for his resignation. \"We'll be fully cooperating with the court-monitored investigation by the high-level police team,\" he told the BBC.\"Let the people be aware of all the transactions since 1998 and what's happening now. We have nothing to hide.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoJames ChaterWatch: Smoke hangs over Louisville after deadly plane crashAt least seven people were killed when a UPS cargo plane crashed while taking off from an airport in Louisville, Kentucky on Tuesday evening, the state's governor said.Andy Beshear said the plane's three crew members were likely to be among the dead after the freight plane exploded as it departed Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport at around 17:15 local time (22:15 GMT).It is unclear whether the death toll includes the three crew members who were onboard the plane.At least 11 other people were injured when the plane crashed, sending thick plumes of black smoke into the sky.Officials warned that people suffered \"very significant\" injuries in the incident and the death toll could rise.Two workers at the auto business that was struck were still unaccounted for as of Tuesday evening, and it is not known how many customers were on the premises when the crash happened.In a statement, UPS said three crew members were on board, adding \"we have not confirmed any injuries/casualties\".A preliminary investigation is under way but officials have said it is too early to say what caused the crash.Officials did note, though, that the massive blaze was due to the amount of fuel onboard the aircraft, which was beginning a journey of around 4,300 miles (6,920km) to Hawaii.The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel when it crashed.It has not been confirmed what cargo was on board, though officials have said the plane was not carrying anything that would create a heightened risk of contamination.The explosion engulfed at least two nearby businesses, including a petroleum recycling company. A shelter-in-place order was initially issued for within five miles of the airport due to concerns of further explosions and air pollution, but was later reduced to just one mile.All departing flights for Tuesday evening were cancelled, the airport said in a statement on X.Louisville Fire Department chief Brian O'Neal said the amount of fuel spilled at the crash site made it a \"very dangerous situation\".An order warning people to shelter in place was reduced from a five-mile radius from the airport to a one-mile radius as crews worked to contain the blaze on Tuesday night.Watch: Aerial view of Louisville airport as firefighters tackle blazeAt a press conference, Beshear warned people not to go to the crash site.\"Anyone who has seen the images and the video knows how violent this crash is,\" he said.\"There are still dangerous things that are flammable, that are potentially explosive.\"Beshear said he would not \"speculate\" as to what caused the incident, adding that the National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) would be leading the investigation.The NTSB's investigative team is scheduled to arrive in Kentucky on Wednesday.Louisville Metro Police Dept Chief Paul Humphrey said that the crash site will be \"an ongoing active scene for the next several days\".He added: \"We don't know how long it's going to take to render that scene safe for the investigation to take place.\"The model of aircraft involved was a MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.The aircraft was originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997.In 2023, FedEx and UPS both announced plans to begin retiring their fleets of MD-11s over the next decade as part of plans to modernise their fleets.In a statement, Boeing said it is \"ready to support our customer\" and that \"our concern is for the safety and well-being of all those affected.\"It added that it will offer technical assistance to the NTSB. ReutersThick plumes of smoke billowed into the sky from the crash siteLouisville is home to UPS Worldport, a global hub for the delivery firm's air cargo operations and its largest package handling facility in the world.During the press conference, Louisville Metro Council member Betsy Ruhe said that the city is a \"UPS town\", and that every resident would know somebody who works for company.\"They're all texting their friends, their family, trying to make sure everyone is safe,\" she said.In a statement, UPS said it was \"terribly saddened\" by the incident and would be halting package sorting operations at Worldport on Tuesday night.It added: \"UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, and customers and the communities we serve. This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers.\"State Senator Keturah Herron said, \"Many of us watch our family members and loved ones pass through [Louisville airport] on a regular basis.\"In a post on X, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that the plane crash is an \"incredible tragedy that our community will never forget\".He added: \"We are so thankful for our brave first responders who have flooded the scene to help try and control the fire and provide support for any victims on the ground.\"If you are in the US and have been affected by this story you can get in touch here",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he has visited troops near the town of Pokrovsk, where the fiercest front line battle between Russia and Ukraine is currently taking place.Zelensky posted photos showing him meeting personnel at a command post in the Dobropillya sector, some 20km (12 miles) north of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.Kyiv's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskiy, said on Monday that Ukraine was increasing pressure on the Dobropillya front to \"force the enemy to disperse its forces and make it impossible to concentrate their main efforts in the Pokrovsk area\".Russia has been trying to seize Pokrovsk - a strategic frontline town and logistic hub - for over a year.Although it has taken them months to approach the town's borders, Russian soldiers have now infiltrated it and on Friday, Zelensky said Russia had amassed 170,000 troops on its outskirts.Both Ukraine and Russia continue to issue claims and counter claims on the situation in and around Pokrovsk.    Capturing Pokrovsk could give Moscow access to the rest of Donetsk, including the towns Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - the so-called \"fortress belt\". Gen Syrskiy, acknowledged his troops were withstanding the \"pressure of a multi-thousand enemy grouping\" but denied they were encircled. Meanwhile, Russian military bloggers claimed 90% of Pokrovsk was under Moscow's control. Unverified videos posted on social media show instances of close quarter combat, drone attacks and street battles there. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Russian forces were operating with \"increasing comfort\" within the town, which once had a population of 60,000 but has now been almost entirely emptied of civilians and largely destroyed.Further east, Moscow's troops are also reportedly targeting the town of Myrnohrad, which would put Ukrainian soldiers at risk of encirclement. Intense drone activity has cut off many logistics routes, making evacuations and the supply of ammunition and vehicles near impossible.On Monday, Zelensky said Russia had had \"no success\" in Pokrovsk in recent days but acknowledged that \"things were not easy\" for Ukrainian forces in the area. He added that a third of all front line clashes were happening in Pokrovsk, and a half of all glide bombs used by the Russians were launched at the town. Earlier last week the Ukrainian president said that Moscow's troops in the area were outnumbering Kyiv's eight to one.Some Ukrainian commentators have criticised the government's efforts to continue to defend Pokrovsk, arguing that troops were being put at risk.In a post accompanying the pictures of his visit to Dobropillya, Zelensky on Tuesday wrote: \"This is our country, this is our East, and we will certainly do our utmost to keep it Ukrainian.\"Russia now controls 81% of the Donetsk region and 99% of neighbouring Luhansk, which collectively make up the Donbas.Moscow has never relented in its ambition to capture the entirety of the area, which Russia's President Vladimir Putin declared annexed in 2022 despite not being in full control of it.However, its progress along the front line has been grinding and occupying the heavily fortified towns in northern Donetsk could come at a huge cost of both manpower and resources.Away from the front line, Russia continues to pummel Ukrainian cities, targeting the country's energy facilities as winter draws in.A large-scale drone attack overnight Monday targeted the southern port of Odesa on the Black Sea, damaging industrial facilities, causing fires and affecting the local power supply. At least 15 civilians were killed and 44 injured in combined drone and missile attacks across the country at the weekend. Ukraine continues to hit back, mostly using drones to target industrial sites across Russia and border regions. On Tuesday, Kyiv said it had attacked a petrochemical plant in the Bashkortostan region and a refinery in the Nizhny Novgorod region, while earlier this week, a drone explosion killed a woman and injured three others in the Russian border region of Belgorod.",

    "body": "11 hours agoAnthony Zurcher,North America correspondent, George Wright and Alex SmithBrooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty ImagesDick Cheney was one of the most powerful US vice-presidents in history under George W BushFormer US President George W Bush has led tributes to Dick Cheney, saying his death is \"a loss to the nation and a sorrow to his friends\".Cheney died from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease on Monday night at the age of 84, his family said in a statement.He became one of the most powerful US vice-presidents in history under Bush, and leaves behind a controversial legacy as a key architect of the \"war on terror\", and an early advocate of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\"History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation,\" Bush said in a statement.Cheney was \"a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position he held\", Bush added.\"I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best. He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people.\"Condoleezza Rice, who served as Secretary of State alongside Cheney in the Bush administration, said she admired him \"for his integrity and his love of our country\".\"He was an inspiring presence and mentor who taught me a great deal about public service,\" she wrote on X.Former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said: \"Though we often disagreed, I always respected his dedication to our country and his unwavering sense of duty.\"Watch: The Iraq war to a hunting accident, Dick Cheney's defining momentsDespite being a stalwart figure in the Republican party for many years, Cheney became a bitter critic of it under the leadership of Donald Trump.The president has yet to comment on his death, but the White House says Trump is \"aware\" of it.Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said: \"Scripture is very clear, we give honour where honour is due.\"\"Even when we had political differences as somebody later in life, you have to honour the sacrifices and the service they gave to their country,\" he said.Flags at the White House were lowered to half-staff on Tuesday morning, shortly after his death was announced.In their statement announcing his death, Cheney's family said that he was a \"great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honour, love, kindness, and fly fishing\".Cheney was a controversial political figure, particularly in his role behind the \"war on terror\", which saw the US invade Iraq in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.Iraqi writer Sinan Antoon said that Cheney's lasting legacy in the country is of \"chaos and terrorism\".\"In a different world Dick Cheney would definitely be a war criminal and would be standing trial,\" he told the BBC's Newshour programme.Kristofer Goldsmith, a US Army veteran who was deployed to Iraq, also told the BBC that \"most people recognise Dick Cheney as someone who created a massive problem that ended up in hundreds of thousands of deaths.\"George W. Bush Presidential Library/Getty ImagesDick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice and George W Bush on 9/11Richard \"Dick\" Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1941 and later attended the prestigious Yale University on a scholarship but failed to graduate.He went on to gain a Master's degree in political science from the University of Wyoming.His first taste of Washington came in 1968, when he worked for William Steiger, a young Republican representative from Wisconsin.Cheney became chief of staff under Gerald Ford in 1975, when he was just 34 years old, before spending a decade in the House of Representatives.As secretary of defence under George Bush Snr, he presided over the Pentagon during the 1990-91 Gulf War, in which a US-led coalition evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait.He became VP to George W Bush in 2001, and played a greater role in making major policy decisions than most of his predecessors.It is for this role that he will be remembered best and most controversially.Getty ImagesDuring the younger Bush's administration, he singlehandedly turned his role as vice-president from what was traditionally an empty role, with little formal power, into a de-facto deputy presidency, overseeing American foreign policy and national security in the wake of the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in 2001.He was a leading advocate of US military action in both Afghanistan and Iraq. In the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, Cheney said that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed so-called weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons were never found during the military campaign.He also repeatedly claimed there were links between Iraq and al-Qaeda, the terror group led by Osama bin Laden that claimed responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. He said the attackers would incur the \"full wrath\" of American military might.Cheney's key role in the campaign heavily affected his political legacy, after the US took years to extricate itself from its costly war in Iraq, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.His political career later became the subject of a major feature film in 2018's Vice - with actor Christian Bale receiving a Golden Globe for his portrayal of the former vice-president.Getty ImagesPresident Gerald Ford with his 34-year-old chief of staff, Dick Cheney, in 1975Cheney had numerous heart problems throughout his life.He suffered the first of many heart attacks in 1978, when he was just 37. Cheney was campaigning for a seat in the House of Representatives at the time - and smoking three packets of cigarettes a day.In 2010 he underwent surgery to install a small heart pump to try to combat \"increasing congestive heart failure\".At this point he had already suffered five heart attacks. Two years later, Cheney had a full heart transplant.He is survived by his wife Lynne, his daughters Liz and Mary Cheney, and seven grandchildren.Lawrence Lucier/FilmMagiGeorge W Bush, Laura Bush, Lynne Cheney and Dick Cheney at the 2004 Republican National ConventionDespite decades working for Republican presidents, he became a bitter opponent of President Donald Trump.Having initially endorsed him in 2016, Cheney was appalled by allegations of Russian interference in the presidential election and Trump's seemingly casual attitude towards Nato.He supported his older daughter, Liz, as she became a leading Republican \"never Trump\" in the House of Representatives - and condemned the refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election.Two months before last year's US presidential election, Cheney staged a major intervention: announcing that he would vote for the Democrats' Kamala Harris.He said there had \"never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump\".In return, Trump called Cheney \"irrelevant RINO\" - an acronym which stands for \"Republican in name only\".Reacting to Cheney's death, Harris said \"his passing marks the loss of a figure who, with a strong sense of dedication, gave so much of his life to the country he loved.\"In his final years, Cheney would become a persona non grata in his own party, which had been reshaped in Trump's image.In an odd final twist, his own Trump criticism - and endorsement of Harris - would win him praise from some on the left who had once denounced him decades earlier.",

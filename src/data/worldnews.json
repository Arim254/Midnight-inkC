    "body": "A woman thought to be dead, who was about to be cremated at a Buddhist temple in the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand, has been found alive by staff.Pairat Soodthoop, general manager of the Wat Rat Prakhong Tham temple, was \"startled\" to hear a faint knock from the coffin, he told the Associated Press news agency. Mr Soodthoop said he asked for the coffin to be opened and saw the woman \"opening her eyes slightly and knocking on the side of the coffin\". \"She must have been knocking for quite some time,\" he added. The brother of the 65-year-old woman said local officials told him his sister had died. However, the temple's manager said the brother did not have a death certificate.As Mr Soodthoop tried to explain to the brother how to obtain a death certificate, the temple's staff heard a faint knock coming from inside the coffin.Once it became clear the woman was alive, the temple's abbot (head of a Buddhist monastery) said the woman should be taken to hospital immediately. A doctor later confirmed that the woman had been experiencing severe hypoglycaemia - a condition where blood sugar levels get critically low, local reports said.The doctor ruled out the possibility that she had suffered respiratory failure or cardiac arrest, according to the reports.The brother said his sibling had been bedridden for the last two years and, as her health deteriorated, she appeared to have stopped breathing on Saturday, according to the temple's manager.The family had travelled nearly 500km (311 mile) from the province of Phitsanulok in Thailand for the cremation ceremony.

    "body": "A mother in New Zealand who killed her two children and hid their bodies in suitcases has been sentenced to life in prison.Hakyung Lee, who was found guilty in September of the shocking murders of eight-year-old Yuna Jo and six-year-old Minu Jo, has to spend at least 17 years behind bars before she is eligible for parole.Lee, 45, argued she was insane at the time of the killings in 2018, which happened soon after her husband died. High Court judge Geoffrey Venning said Lee's mental health played a part in the case, but that her actions were calculated.The children's remains were discovered only in 2022 by a couple who won an auction for the contents of an abandoned storage unit in Auckland.During a trial lasting more than two weeks, Hakyung Lee's defence lawyers told the court that her mental health deteriorated after Jo's death, and that she came to believe it was best if the rest of the family died together. Lee tried to kill herself and her children by giving them a dose of the antidepressant nortriptyline mixed in juice, but got the dose wrong and woke up to find her children were dead, her lawyers said.Prosecutors argued that Lee's was \"a selfish act to free herself from the burden of parenting alone\".After the killings, Lee changed her name and left New Zealand. She was arrested in South Korea - where she was born - in September 2022, and extradited back to New Zealand later that year.The court heard on Wednesday how the killings pained Lee's and her husband Ian Jo's families.In an emotional statement read out by prosecutors, Lee's mother Choon Ja Lee  said she regrets not taking her daughter to a counsellor, noting that Lee had \"no will to live\" after Jo died of cancer in November 2017.\"If she wanted to die, why didn't she die alone? Why did she take the innocent children with her?\" Choon Ja Lee wrote, according to New Zealand media reports.Jo's brother Jimmy said he \"never imagined such a profound tragedy would ever befall our family\".His own mother - Yuna's and Minu's other grandmother - still does not know they are dead, he said.\"It was my late brother's will that I protect them,\" said Jimmy Jo. \"This is an ongoing sentence from which I can never be paroled.\"Lee was likely suffering from an \"atypical depression\" and prolonged grief reaction at the time of the murders, according to a psychiatric assessment conducted before the sentencing, local broadcaster RNZ reported.Justice Venning ordered that Lee be treated as a \"special patient\" during her imprisonment, given her mental state.\"You could not cope when [your husband] became seriously unwell, and perhaps you could not bear to have the children around you as a constant reminder of your former happy life, which had been cruelly taken from you,\" the judge said.",

    "body": "Fame can take as many years off a musician's life as occasionally smoking cigarettes, a new study has found, after comparing data between famous singers and less well-known artists.Stardom can shorten lives by 4.6 years, according to research published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.Touring, performing, and rock'n'roll lifestyles have previously been found to lower life expectancy for musicians.However, the new analysis shows a direct link between fame and mortality for the first time.Researchers from the University Witten Herdecke based in Witten, Germany, examined data of 648 singers, half of whom were dubbed famous and the other half less famous. These included a mix of solo artists, lead and back-up singers in a band.Famous stars were selected from the top 2,000 Artists of All Time, a list collated by the ranking website Acclaimed Music. The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, and Bruce Springstein round out the site's top five most recognised names.Academics matched each famous singer to a less famous one, paired up based on their characteristics such as gender, nationality, and genre of music. They found that famous singers lived to an average age of 75 while less famous singers lived to 79.\"The increased mortality risk associated with fame is comparable to other well-known health risks such as occasional smoking,\" the authors wrote.By isolating fame as a risk factor, the study shows achieving stardom can be a \"turning point\" in bringing about greater health concerns.Solo artists also carried a higher mortality risk, the study found, compared with singers who could turn to band members for \"emotional and practical support\". Loss of privacy, intense public scrutiny, and performance pressure are all mooted contributing factors, although the study notes it is not conclusively linked.\"Being famous is an important factor influencing longevity and underscores the need for targeted interventions to mitigate its detrimental effects on longevity.\"The study was however gender-skewed, 83.5% male to 16.5% female.\"Live fast, die young\" lifestyles have been the focus of previous research into mortality risks associated with fame, including greater chance of drug and alcohol abuse.Pop stars experiencing fame between the ages of two and 25 were found to be two to three times more likely to experience risks of mortality compared to the general population, a US-based study found in 2007.Popular culture has made reference to the 27 Club, made up of rock stars who died at the age of 27, including Amy Winehouse, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, and Brian Jones.In 2011, a study published in the British Medical Journal concluded there was no heightened risk of death for famous musicians at the specific age of 27, finding instead that young rock stars have a \"generally increased risk throughout their 20s and 30s\".In recent years, fans and loved ones have been left devastated by the deaths of young popular artists such as rapper Mac Miller (26), DJ Avicii (28), and One Direction's Liam Payne (31).",

    "body": "Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered that right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro begin serving his prison sentence of 27 years and three months for plotting a coup after he lost the last election.Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday ruled that the case had reached its final judgement and that no further appeals were possible. Bolsonaro, 70, was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.He will begin serving his sentence in a federal police jail cell in the capital, Brasilia, where he has been detained since Saturday after being deemed a flight risk and removed from home detention. At a hearing on Sunday, Bolsonaro admitted trying to open his ankle monitor with a soldering iron until he \"came to his senses\", court documents show. He said he had had no intention of fleeing and blamed medicine-induced \"paranoia\" for damage he caused to the monitor. Justice Moraes on Tuesday mandated that full-time medical care be given to Bolsonaro, whose medical team has previously said he is suffering from worsening health.Supreme Court justices said in September, when Bolsonaro was found guilty of plotting a coup, that he had known of plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes, who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro, whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.Bolsonaro was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.The former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.Justice Moraes also ordered on Tuesday that others found guilty of being Bolsonaro's co-conspirators must begin their sentences.They include Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional security, and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, former defence minister.",

    "body": "A parking inspector and his wife have been arrested on suspicion of embezzling more than €1m (£878,000) from a small German town's parking meters.The unnamed municipal employee is thought to have taken coins out of parking meters in Kempten \"on numerous occasions\" and placed them in bank accounts that his wife had access to, local police said in a statement.A money laundering report by a credit institution alerted investigators to the suspected theft. The inspector faces charges relating to 720 alleged incidents of theft, while his wife faces charges of aiding and abetting theft, also in 720 cases.Kempten Mayor Thomas Kiechle said he was \"stunned and dismayed\" by the allegations. In October, the Kempten public prosecutor's office was informed that cash was repeatedly being deposited into several bank accounts, according to the German news agency DPA.Police then searched office premises in the early hours of 24 November, the same day that a 40-year-old man and a 38-year old woman were arrested.They are now being held in separate detention facilities.It is not clear how long it might have taken the couple to accrue the sum.In response to the allegations, Kiechle announced the appointment of a commission to \"review past work processes, uncover potential weaknesses, and reliably remedy them for the future.\"Kiechle noted that the names of the couple could not currently be released due to the ongoing investigation and privacy concerns.In a written statement, Kiechle said: \"I naturally support the public prosecutor's office and the police in their thorough investigation of the allegations.\"\"Until the proceedings are concluded, the presumption of innocence applies,\" he added.Kempten is one of the oldest settlements in Germany. Located in the country's south, it sits under the hills of the Allgäu and has around 70,000 residents.",

In Vietnam, the death toll has risen to 91 in a week, while in Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been forced from their homes.More than 2 million people in Thailand have been affected by the floods, but just 13,000 have been moved to shelters. The vast majority are cut off and unable to get help, according to Reuters news agency.The Thai military, which has been put in charge of tackling the crisis, said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies, along with field kitchens that are said to be able to deliver 3,000 meals a day.Medical teams on board the aircraft carrier will convert it into a \"floating hospital\" if required, the navy said.Boats, high-clearance trucks, and jet skis have also been deployed to evacuate residents, said the governor of Songkhla province, where Hat Yai is located.The cabinet on Tuesday declared Songkhla a disaster zone, freeing up funds for relief.However, many people remain stranded amid the rising waters. A volunteer rescue group, the Matchima Rescue Center, told Reuters it had been inundated with thousands of calls in the last three days, with people asking to be evacuated.ReutersA drone view shows dozens of vehicles at least partially submerged in a carpark Hat YaiPeople have also posted urgent calls for help on Matchima's Facebook page. \"Many people are trapped... Please help,\" one user wrote. \"It's very difficult right now. The water has reached the second floor, where there are children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled!!!\" Another wrote that his household had been waiting for help for three days: \"Every second is crucial now... Please help share. My [phone's] battery is at 40%. Thank you everyone.\"Some also wrote about not having had any food and water for days.A clip that has gone viral on social media shows three young boys hanging from power lines, trying to inch their way to safety while brown murky waters continue to rise below them.In Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with 126 evacuation centres set up in the northern border areas.In the states of Kelantan and Perlis, rescue teams waded through knee-deep floodwaters to evacuate residents in areas where rising waters had cut off access to roads.ReutersThe Thai military said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies",

    "body": "Israel has received, via the Red Cross, a coffin that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) say contains the body of one of the last three deceased hostages still in Gaza, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.Israeli forces will now transfer the body to Israel's National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Earlier, PIJ and Hamas announced that the body of an Israeli hostage had been found in central Gaza on Monday.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office warned that it viewed \"with severity the delay in the immediate transfer\" of the body, saying it constituted a \"further violation\" of the six-week-old Gaza ceasefire agreement.Following the handover in central Gaza on Tuesday afternoon, the office announced that the families of the three dead hostages had been updated accordingly.\"Our hearts are with them in this difficult hour,\" it added. \"The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned.\"Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 22 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 330 Palestinians killed during the war.Two of the three remaining dead hostages are Israelis - Ran Gvili, 24, and Dror Or, 48 - and one is Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.The dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 69,770 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterForeign tourists visiting popular US national parks like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite will need to pay an extra fee, the Trump administration said on Tuesday.The Department of the Interior, which runs the country's national parks, said each international visitor will need to pay $100 (£76) on top of existing fees to access 11 of the most popular sites.From 2026, non-residents will also need to pay more than $250 for an annual pass to the parks, while US citizens and permanent residents will continue to pay $80.The fee hike aims to \"put American families first\" and reflects President Donald Trump's goal to make the parks more accessible and affordable for US citizens, said the department.\"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.The increase will take effect at the start of 2026, alongside the launch of an upgraded online booking system and better access for motorcyclists across the parks.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, \"patriotic fee-free\" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.The fee hike follows an executive order, signed by Trump in July, to raise entrance fees at national parks for overseas visitors. The extra revenue would raise funds for conservation and maintenance at the sites, the White House said at the time - even as the Trump administration planned deep cuts to the Park Service budget.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before.The country's most visited parks include the Everglades in Florida, Yosemite in California and Colorado's Rocky Mountains.",

    "body": "1 day agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesMarjorie Taylor Greene's five years in Congress will come to an early end on 5 January after she unexpectedly announced her resignation following a bitter rift with President Donald Trump.The surprise move from the Georgia congresswoman - a rising star in the Republican party - has left many speculating about her next steps.Her decision follows a public fallout with Trump, who branded her \"a traitor\" and said he would endorse her opponent in next year's election. It comes after months of Greene's blistering criticism on the Trump administration's refusal to release files related to the investigation into the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein - as well as several of Trump's policy positions.Rumours have already begun circulating that Greene, 51, might run for president in 2028, which she immediately shot down. So, if not the Oval Office, what is next for Greene? Run for president in 2028Although she claims she has no interest in the presidency now, having a future change of heart is not an unknown feature of US politics.When Greene signed a petition to force a vote requiring the release of the files related to Epstein - over Trump's objections - it went on to a bill authored by her Democratic colleague, Ro Khanna. Khanna told NBC News after Greene's latest announcement that she was \"likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate\", adding that she was \"more in touch\" with Trump's base than his number two, Vice-President JD Vance. Time Magazine also reported that Greene \"privately told allies\" she was considering a presidential bid, but Greene quickly dismissed the assertion as a \"complete lie\".\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene wrote on social media, re-posting Time Magazine's article. Greene has notably distanced herself from her party's positions - and from the president - for whom she once was an ardent supporter. She has spoken out against issues including Epstein files, Trump's global tariffs, support for Israel and healthcare funding. A possible run for governor or Senate Greene has not been quite as explicit about ruling out the possibility of running for Georgia governor or to represent her state in the US Senate.Elections for both take place in 2026.Two-time Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is up against his term limit and unable to run again, widening the field of possible replacements. Greene could also use her clout to pursue the race for the US Senate and attempt to unseat Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year.Both the role of governor and US senator are ones that Greene has expressed interest in, at least according to Trump.In the president's public spat with Greene following her resignation announcement, Trump wrote on social media that the feud began \"when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor\".\"She was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!)\", he said.Kennesaw State University Professor of Political Science Kerwin Swint, who lives in Greene's congressional district, says that Trump is aware of her unpopularity outside of her immediate district, and that she would probably \"get obliterated\" if she ran for statewide office.Without those options, the only other office she may have her sights on is president, despite her protestations.\"I don't see that happening,\" Swint says. \"She would be such an amazing longshot to dark horse. \"But most politicians have a big enough ego that they look in the mirror, they see a future president. So it's not out of the question.\"Entering the conservative media landscape Swint predicts that she'll start a podcast and attempt to remain in the public spotlight by continuing to build her media profile.\"I think she wants to be an influencer basically. And so I think someone who wants to do that is going to reach for these media opportunities,\" he says.If she chooses a life outside of politics, Greene would join a host of former politicians and political operatives who have launched careers in the podcast arena. After Republican Representative Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress to accept his failed nomination to become Trump's US attorney general, he started his own podcast. The trend has even caught hold on the left, with Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom also hosting his own podcast. Meanwhile, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino went on to join the Trump administration after success as a radio host and commentator.Greene could also decide to become a conservative commentator on more left-leaning networks, like CNN, where she has made frequent appearances in recent days. \"I knew she was going to be the next co-host of The View!\", conservative personality Megan McCain wrote on X, referring to Greene's recent appearance on ABC's liberal-leaning daily chat show.Leave politics behind completelyIn the 10-minute video announcing her resignation, Greene also suggested she might leave politics to spend more time with her family who she said she missed \"precious time with\" as she fought for Trump. Throughout her time in politics, Greene said, she faced \"never ending personal attacks\" and \"threats\". \"It has been unfair and wrong, not only to me, but especially to my family,\" she said.  Since her public feud with the president, Greene said the threats against her have only increased.In addition to being a member of Congress, Greene is also the owner of a commercial construction and renovation company called Taylor Commercial. The company has managed roughly $250m in construction projects, since Greene acquired it in 2002, according to her website. With reporting by Max Matza",

    "body": "11 hours agoSebastian UsherGlobal affairs reporterBBCZeynab Javadli divorced Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 2019The former wife of a member of Dubai's ruling family has expressed concern that she could be arrested as her ex-husband has lodged a criminal complaint with local police, accusing her of kidnapping their three young daughters.Since their divorce in 2019, Zeynab Javadli has been involved in a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is the nephew of the ruler of Dubai.It has come to a head in recent weeks as the children have changed hands between the parents several times, with each accusing the other of kidnapping them.Ms Javadli also potentially faces arrest for e-crimes - online offences - after she livestreamed the latest showdown.In going public, she says she realised that she was taking a big risk.\"I knew that it was the last chance to be with my children as they would never let me see them again.  I genuinely believed that it was my last chance, so I just opened a livestream and called for help,\" she said in a video message to her British lawyer, David Haigh.Ms Javadli was speaking from her house in Dubai, where she claims that she and her three daughters have essentially once again been isolated since she took them back with her after they'd been with their father for several weeks. Up until then, Ms Javadli had had effective custody of the children under a deal she says was agreed with the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in 2022. That agreement, she says, guaranteed her custody of the children until they were 18 years old, as well as a house and other assistance. Their schooling has been paid for by their father.In return, David Haigh says she had to sign papers saying that she would - among other things - not speak to the media again about her situation, nor would she do any more livestreaming.A subsequent court ruling granted custody to Sheikh Saeed, but Ms Javadli says she received assurances from those involved in her case that the deal with Dubai's ruler would not be affected.That remained the situation until two months ago.That was when - during one of the regular visitations of the children with Sheikh Saeed - that Ms Javadli says she received a message from him through Dubai police telling her there was no need to wait as they would not be returned to her that day.She heard nothing from them for several weeks. She was finally granted a visitation for three hours at a child protection centre and headed there with her driver on 8 November. She says that when she entered the centre, her children were not there. As she was coming out of the building, she saw them. She says they rushed towards her.She says they were shouting \"Mama, take us from here!\" She told her driver to lock the doors and drive them home.But she claims their way was blocked by cars belonging to people working for her ex-husband. That was when she decided to open a livestream and plead for help. In doing so, she knew that she risked breaking the deal she had signed with the authorities in the UAE and that she could face arrest for doing so, but she insists that it was her only recourse.She has been at home with her children since then and says she does not dare to go out for fear of arrest. The three girls - aged nine, seven and six - have not been going to school.The BBC has contacted a number of officials in the UAE, who are involved in the case, for comment, but has received no reply so far. However, the perspective of Sheikh Saeed is clear from court depositions.The most recent gives a very different version of what happened on 8 November, accusing Ms Javadli of forcibly placing the children into her car with the help of her driver and then kidnapping them. It also accuses Ms Javadli of posting videos on social media in which \"she insulted and slandered\" her former husband as well as defaming the state and violating state laws.Previously, lawyers acting for Sheikh Saeed had claimed in court that Ms Javadli was an unfit mother, who had failed to send her daughters to school, was living in a place unsuitable for the children when she was in a hotel, and that she had put the health of the youngest girl at risk.Ms Javadli rejected the accusations and her Emirati legal team submitted evidence to the contrary in court.David Haigh says that there've been other similar cases involving former wives of members of Dubai's royal family or other female members of the family. He himself has been involved in campaigning for several of the women. None of these cases involve Sheikh Saeed.Princess Haya - the ex-wife of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - fled the UAE in 2019, saying that she feared for her life. Three years later, the princess won a custody battle that played out in the highest court in the UK, which gave her sole custody of their two children.The most sensational saga was that of one of the daughters of Dubai's ruler, Princess Latifa, who mounted a bid for freedom in 2018 from what at the time she claimed was her family's coercive control.The boat on which she was making her escape was intercepted in the Indian Ocean and she was forcibly returned to Dubai. She then claimed that she was being held captive in secret videos. She has since re-emerged to a limited extent in public, saying that she was well and living as she wished.Ms Javadli and David Haigh say that Dubai portrays itself as promoting women's rights and encouraging women - whether from the UAE or from outside - to lead fulfilling lives, both professionally and personally. For many, this is no doubt the case.But they claim that Ms Javadli's case shows that beneath the glittering surface of Dubai, for some women the situation can be more complicated and more uncomfortable.",

    "body": "Music eases surgery and speeds recovery, Indian study finds1 day agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentBBCA patient with headphones playing music during surgery in a hospital in DelhiUnder the harsh lights of an operating theatre in the Indian capital, Delhi, a woman lies motionless as surgeons prepare to remove her gallbladder.She is under general anaesthesia: unconscious, insensate and rendered completely still by a blend of drugs that induce deep sleep, block memory, blunt pain and temporarily paralyse her muscles.Yet, amid the hum of monitors and the steady rhythm of the surgical team, a gentle stream of flute music plays through the headphones placed over her ears.Even as the drugs silence much of her brain, its auditory pathway remains partly active. When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.That, at least, is what a new peer-reviewed study from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\" Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.Getty ImagesPatients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgeryIn procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. \"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by Michael Jackson's death but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups The results were striking.Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLisa LambertPA MediaUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shakes hands with Dan Driscoll in KyivWhen talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war took an unexpected turn last week, with the leak of a peace plan said to come from the US, the Trump administration dispatched an unlikely figure to attend a flurry of overseas meetings. The youngest-ever army secretary, 39-year-old Dan Driscoll, is often referred to as President Donald Trump's \"drone guy\" for his embrace of emerging battlefield technologies. Until recently, he was mostly known for discussions of budgets, supplies and staff issues in the military's largest branch. Driscoll does not appear have a long history of dealing with Russian and Ukraine, or experience in international diplomacy, and has never held public office.So, who is this increasingly prominent figure within the administration?Close ally of Vice-President JD VanceIt is Driscoll's relationship with the now-vice president, JD Vance, that brought him into Trump's orbit.Like his friend Vance, Driscoll attended a public university before joining the US Army, and then earned his law degree at the prestigious Yale University. Both men also worked in finance after graduating. During his military career, Driscoll became an officer in 2007, led a cavalry platoon and deployed to Iraq for several months in 2009. He has told the story of meeting Vance through a veterans' student group at law school, during which Vance reassured new students that they would at first feel as if they did not belong, but would excel at classes after a few months. Soon, Vance became Driscoll's friend and mentor.Driscoll was on holiday with his family in Switzerland in the summer of 2024 when Vance called to tell him he was going to be Trump's running mate and asked him to join the campaign.The next day, Driscoll flew back to the US, bought a suit at an outlet mall, and took an Uber to the Republican National Convention, he told the alumni magazine for the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - the institution where he was an undergraduate.Once Trump returned to office, Driscoll was swiftly approved as army secretary in his Senate confirmation vote. His sphere of influence expanded after he became a key figure in Trump's deployment of the National Guard to US cities. Afterwards, he also took over the role of acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.Getty ImagesDriscoll at his confirmation hearing in JanuaryUnannounced visit to UkraineDriscoll has often spoken about the war in Ukraine - pointing to Ukrainian drones as a relatively cheap, mass-produced technology that is good for fighting. But after being nominated for the army secretary job, he did not initially appear to be involved in negotiations to end the war. Trump was instead relying on his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to work on a plan for a ceasefire. When details of a 28-point plan drafted by the US and Russia were leaked last week, Ukraine immediately voiced concern at some of its key points - and its European allies followed suit. Driscoll then made an unannounced visit to Ukraine along with other high-ranking Pentagon figures, the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. The purpose, according to a US Army spokesman, was to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war.Driscoll met Zelensky and was then, according to Politico, feted at a reception at the US ambassador's residence.In subsequent days, Driscoll participated in more discussions with Ukrainian officials in Geneva alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and helped draw up an \"updated and refined peace framework\". He went on to hold talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said in an effort to finalise the peace plan, he had directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. He said Driscoll would meet with the Ukrainian side.A future envoy... or defence secretary?Getty ImagesDriscoll with National Guard troops in WashingtonIn nominating Driscoll as his army secretary, Trump wrote he had a \"powerful combination of experiences to serve as a disruptor and change agent\".Some in Washington are wondering if those qualities and his recent appearance on the world stage mean that Driscoll could one day replace Pete Hegseth, if Hegseth ever steps down as defence secretary.While he has never held public office, Driscoll worked in Congress as an intern for the Senate's veteran affairs committee, and in 2020 he made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in North Carolina. A former professor has suggested Driscoll aimed \"to serve in the military, go to law school and be in politics\".There is also the possibility Driscoll could step officially into the role of negotiating with Ukraine when Trump's special envoy to the country, Keith Kellogg, leaves in January. Or he could stay as the head of hundreds of thousands of troops in the US Army. Driscoll has previously highlighted that his father and grandfather served in the military before him, and he often speaks about his vision of transforming the Army. Days before heading to Ukraine, Driscoll described to The Conversation podcast how he imagined the near future, when \"every infantryman...will carry a drone into battle\" and soldiers would rely on artificial intelligence because human brains will not be able to \"keep up\" with the pace of action. \"Our window to change is right now,\" he said in a speech in October. \"And we will win with silicon and software, not our soldiers' blood and bodies.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoJane ChambersBusiness reporter, Aguas Calientes, PeruAFP via Getty ImagesMachu Picchu attracts more than 1.6 million tourists per year, but getting there is not easyMachu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.Wilson ChiloA fleet of buses ferry tourists to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas CalientesBack in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,\" he says. \"This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners.\"These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.AFP via Getty ImagesUnless you fancy a long hike, the only way to get to the town of Aguas Calientes is by trainAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train.\"Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site \"was a nightmare for us\". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.Wilson ChiloCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón says Consettur would welcome the competitionOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that \"more needs to be done for the local communities\".She adds: \"We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition.\"Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru.\"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,\" he says. \"If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term.\"He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,\" says Mr Gonzalez. \"And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion.\"But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years.\"I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to.\"Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Toronto run buses to and from Machu Picchu.\"If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them.\"Read more global business and tech stories",

    "body": "Family reunited after a decade – now a Trump clampdown could tear them apart1 day agoLiam Weir/BBCMarven says his life feels \"more complete\" now he has got to know Rochelle and GuerlineNawal al-Maghafi and Jasmin DyerBBC World Service, FloridaIn a waterside house in the town of Lakeland, Florida, Marven laughs with two women he loves dearly - his sister Rochelle and their biological mother, Guerline.The warmth between them is unmistakable as they celebrate his 16th birthday, even though they spent a decade apart. Now they fear being separated again.Also celebrating is Stacey Nageli Angulo, who adopted Marven when he was three years old, from Haiti, in the wake of a devastating earthquake in 2010.She helped Guerline and Rochelle come to the US three years ago, reuniting the family, as spreading gang violence triggered a fresh humanitarian crisis in the Caribbean island nation.The two Haitian women, whose names we have changed for their safety, live and work legally in the US under a scheme called Temporary Protected Status (TPS). It provides protection for people already in the US who are from countries hit by war or natural disaster.But TPS is due to end for 350,000 Haitians in February, as part of US President Donald Trump's sweeping changes to immigration policies.Liam Weir/BBCMarven turned 16 recently, about three years after being reunited with his biological mother and sisterRochelle, now aged 21, cheers, as Marven blows out his candles, but Guerline's smile falters. In just a few months, the two women could be deported.After the earthquake, Guerline lived in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, struggling to provide for her children. She says offering Marven for adoption \"scarred\" her, but she \"wanted a better life for him\".Stacey, who now renovates properties after a career in the corporate world, says she felt compelled to adopt a child from Haiti in the aftermath of the disaster and raised Marven alongside her two biological children.More recently, hearing about the violence, she began researching legal routes to the US for Rochelle and Guerline. When a humanitarian scheme opened in 2023, they applied immediately. \"Three weeks later they were approved and on an airplane and here with us,\" she says.The two Haitian women moved into a caravan on Stacey's driveway, before renting an apartment locally. Guerline now works in a hotel. Rochelle has jobs at a supermarket and a nursery, and dreams of becoming a nurse.Marven often sleeps over at their apartment and loves the Haitian food Guerline cooks. He says his life now \"feels more complete\".But Rochelle and Guerline are terrified of returning to Haiti. The gang violence has displaced a tenth of the population, according to the UN, with kidnappings and killings rising sharply. Rape and arson are rampant.Getty ImagesGangs control much of Haiti's capital - Jimmy \"Barbecue\" Cherizier (centre), seen here in 2024, leads one of them Rochelle, now 21, says her biggest fear in Port-au-Prince was being kidnapped. \"I was at school and I've seen young girls like me get kidnapped,\" she says. \"They asked a ransom for them and then they didn't get them back,\" she says, adding that she believes some girls who are taken are either raped or killed.She says she receives harrowing videos from friends and relatives in Haiti every day, including bodies being burned and gang shootouts: \"There's gun fighting all the time. You can't really go out.\"Stacey voted for President Trump in the past three presidential elections but is now horrified that  Rochelle and Guerline could be sent back.\"Do we want open borders? Absolutely not. Do we want criminals deported? Absolutely,\" she says. \"But to rip families apart like ours and deport people to countries where it's absolutely unsafe… is unthinkable and unconscionable.\"ReutersMany of Haiti's 1.4m displaced people have moved into temporary shelters in schools and other buildingsTPS for Haitians has been extended repeatedly since it was first designated in 2010.But now the US Department for Homeland Security (DHS) says \"the environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home\".The US government, however, advises its citizens not to travel there, because of \"kidnapping, crime, terrorist activity, civil unrest\".The US immigration service says continuing the scheme for Haitians is not in US interests, citing difficulties vetting migrants and obtaining information from Haitian law enforcement agencies, coupled with the \"serious threat posed by Haitian gangs\".A spokesman for the DHS also told the BBC in September that TPS had been abused and exploited.The US administration says those whose TPS ends can leave voluntarily or pursue other immigration options. Lawyers say few will qualify to stay, and many will go underground.In Miami, another Haitian woman, who we are calling Monique, tells us she has lived in the US for more than 16 years. Her small home is lined with photos of her husband, son and daughter. She is the only one of them facing deportation - her husband is a permanent resident, her daughter is a US citizen and her son has a green card application in progress.Monique, who now works as a bus driver, came legally under a humanitarian programme before moving on to TPS in 2010.\"Yes, it's called Temporary Protected Status,\" she says. \"But it's temporary if your home is safe. Haiti is not safe.\"She wipes away tears, convinced she will lose everything and possibly die if she returns: \"Don't send us to Haiti… just kill us.\"Liam Weir/BBCStacey says she felt compelled to adopt a child in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti Over a million people hold TPS in the US, with people from 20 countries granted the protection since 1990.This year, the US has ended it for six countries - Afghanistan, Cameroon, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela. There have been multiple legal challenges, including one which delayed the end of TPS for Haitians.In Florida, where 56% of voters backed Donald Trump, many Republican supporters, like Stacey, told us they wanted to see immigration law enforced but were concerned about the human cost of current policies.She feels the Republican Party is \"completely out of touch\" with its voter base on immigration.Local businessman Sam Romain, who is the chair of Polk County Republicans, however,  is less sympathetic: \"You knew that it was temporary, you built your life on a temporary status and now… you're upset it's expiring. We knew what the rules were.\"When pressed on the situation in Haiti, he says he is not qualified to assess whether it is safe enough to return to, but believes the decision is made by qualified officials and he trusts their judgement.CLARENS SIFFROY/AFP via Getty ImagesWhole neighbourhoods have been attacked and destroyed in Port-au-PrinceMr Romain says he believes in America as \"a nation of law and order\" and adds that immigration reform \"does need to happen\".For Rochelle and Guerline, the future is filled with uncertainty.\"We were told America is the land of freedom and safety,\" says Rochelle. \"Now I don't know where we belong.\"\"I love my sister very much,\" says Marven. \"I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to her.\"The three pose together for a photograph - mother, son, and daughter. But in a few months' time, two of them could be gone.",

    "body": "An Australian teenager has died after he was hit by a cricket ball during a practice session in Melbourne.Ben Austin, 17, was training - with a helmet but no neck guard - in cricket nets in Ferntree Gully on Tuesday when he was hit in the neck by a ball thrown using a handheld ball launcher. Emergency workers attended the scene around 17:00 local time (06:00 GMT) before Ben was rushed to hospital in critical condition. He was put on life support but died on Thursday.Ben's dad Jace Austin said the family was \"utterly devastated\" by the death of \"our beautiful Ben\" while Cricket Victoria said the cricketing community across the country would be mourning the teenager's death.In a statement, Jace Austin shared details of his family's loss. \"For Tracey and I, Ben was an adored son, deeply loved brother to Cooper and Zach and a shining light in the lives of our family and friends,\" he said. \"This tragedy has taken Ben from us, but we find some comfort that he was doing something he did for so many summers - going down to the nets with mates to play cricket.\"He loved cricket and it was one of the joys of his life.\"Mr Austin said the family was also supporting Ben's teammate who was bowling in the nets when the accident happened.\"This accident has impacted two young men and our thoughts are with he and his family as well,\" he said.He also thanked the local cricketing community for their support since the accident and praised the first responders and medical staff who helped his son. Cricket Victoria chief executive officer Nick Cummins said it was an \"extremely challenging time\" for all involved.\"The ball hit him in the neck in a similar accident that Phil Hughes suffered 10 years ago,\" Mr Cummins said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).In 2014, Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died after being struck on the neck by a ball while batting in the Sheffield Shield.His death, for which a coroner ultimately found no-one was to blame, sparked improvements to safety equipment for those playing the sport.The ball that hit Ben was apparently launched by a thrower using a handheld device, commonly used to accelerate the speed of the ball and ease the strain of bowling on the shoulders.In a statement, Cummins said: \"The entire cricketing community in Victoria - and nationally - is mourning this loss and it will be something that will stay with us for a long time.\"He described Ben as a talented player, popular teammate and captain who was well- known in under-18 circles in Melbourne's south east.\"It is heartbreaking to see a young life cut so short, while Ben was doing something that he loved so much,\" Mr Cummins said. Ben played for the Ferntree Gully Cricket Club who, in a social media post, paid tribute to the youngster as someone who brought joy to many. The club also called on friends and supporters to \"put your bats out for Benny\", mirroring a similar gesture that was made for Hughes.The Waverley Park Hawks Junior Football Club, for which Ben played more than 100 games, said he was \"kind\", \"respectful\" and a \"fantastic footballer\".\"Our club and community have lost a truly great young person who was developing into a fine young adult and his loss will be felt keenly by our club for many years to come.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentThe commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces has warned Russian activity is increasing around the key frontline town of Pokrovsk, saying \"the situation is difficult\".General Oleksandr Syrskyi admitted Russian infantry was massing in the area and said he had visited the frontline himself for talks with key commanders.But he said reports that Ukrainian troops had been \"blockaded\" there by Russian forces was \"untrue\" propaganda.There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town in the Donetsk region in the east of Ukraine. It forms a key transport and supply hub and its capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.In a statement on Telegram, General Syrskyi said: \"In Pokrovsk, enemy infantry, avoiding combat, is amassing in the urban area and changing locations, so the primary objective is to identify and destroy them.\"He added: \"The situation is difficult, but Russian propaganda claims about the alleged 'blockade' of the Ukrainian Defence Forces in Pokrovsk, as well as in Kupiansk, are untrue.\"He said commanders were having to maintain \"a reasonable balance between goals and capabilities.\"\"The main priority is preserving the lives of our soldiers,\" he added.Russian forces have been trying to seize Pokrovsk for more than a year. Taking it would give them a path towards taking the two biggest cities still controlled by Ukraine in the region - Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Russia's chief of general staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, claimed earlier this week Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk had been surrounded.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Pokrovsk was \"the main target\" for Russia whose forces there, he said, outnumbered Ukrainians by eight to one.He told reporters Russia wanted to take the town to convince the United States that Ukraine was on the run.\"They do not have a result they can 'sell' to the Americans. We understand why they need Pokrovsk. They need it only to claim that Ukraine withdraws from the east and gives everything else they want,\" Zelensky said.In its latest assessment, the defence intelligence firm, Sybelline, said the battle for Pokrovsk \"has entered a highly dynamic and intense phase, as the Russian forces intensify their efforts to infiltrate the city and encircle Ukrainian defenders\".Deepstate, a Ukrainian monitoring group, said Russian forces were \"gradually engulfing\" Pokrovsk \"with [their] sheer number of personnel\". It said Russian troops were infiltrating deeper into the town and disrupting Ukrainian supply routes. \"The situation in Pokrovsk is on the brink of crisis and continues to deteriorate, to the point where it may be too late to fix everything,\" the group concluded.",

    "body": "K-pop group NewJeans has lost a legal battle to leave its record label Ador.A South Korean court on Tuesday ruled that the act's contract with the label, which runs until 2029, remains valid.The group's five members - Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji - announced last year that they were unilaterally leaving the agency, citing mistreatment and manipulation.The group has said it will appeal the ruling, according to local media reports.NewJeans said it is \"impossible to return to Ador\" and continue their activities as normal, the reports said.The Seoul Central Disctrict Court rejected NewJeans' argument that the dismissal of former Ador CEO Min Hee-jin, who was also the group's mentor, constituted a breach of contract. NewJeans alleged that her dismissal broke their trust with the agency.In a statement released after the ruling, Ador said it sincerely hopes that the judgment \"will serve as an opportunity for the artists to calmly reflect on this matter\". The label added that the it is ready for the members' upcoming activities, including the release of an album, and is now \"waiting\".The case stunned South Korea where record labels wield large amounts of power and tightly control their stars. It is highly unusual for artists to rebel against them. Formed in July 2022, NewJeans, whose members are aged from 17 to 21, had enjoyed rapid success before their dramatic fallout with the agency.Their first single Attention topped Korean charts right after their debut, while their hit song SuperShy made multiple \"best of the year\" lists at the end of 2023, including those compiled by Rolling Stone, NME and Billboard Magazine.Critics had called them a \"game-changer\" as their blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop scene dominated by electronic beats. Tuesday's ruling follows a year-long standoff between the chart-topping group and its agency.The group's announcement to split from Ador, which was made in November last year during a press conference, came after a long and public spat between Min Hee-jin, and Ador, as well as its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.Tensions between Min and Hybe started in April 2024, when Hybe launched audits into Ador, which was then managed by Min, while calling her to step down.Min rejected Hybe's allegations that she was plotting to go independent. In August, she was dismissed as the CEO of Ador.The band soon issued an ultimatum demanding that Min be reinstated. When Hybe refused, the members went public with a series of complaints against the label, including claims it had deliberately undermined their careers.One of the group's members, Hanni, also alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label.In December, Ador filed a lawsuit asking the court to confirm the validity of their contract with the group.As the disputes continued, the group's five members attemped to rebrand themselves as NJZ in February. They planned to release a new song, but the promotions were halted by a court order.The group still performed it at a show in Hong Kong, where they announced a hiatus.Back in March, after the court injunction was issued, the group described the court's decision as \"a shock\", but said the five of them would \"go through it\" together.",

    "body": "Cruise operator 'failed' woman who was left on island and died, family says18 hours agoLana LamSydneySuppliedSuzanne Rees was found dead hours after her cruise boat left Lizard IslandThe daughter of a woman who was left behind by a cruise ship on a remote island and later found dead has accused the operator of a \"failure of care and common sense\".The body of Suzanne Rees, 80, was found by rescue workers on Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef on Sunday. The day before, she had been hiking on the island with her fellow passengers but was not on the ship when it left hours later.Katherine Rees said she was \"shocked and saddened\" that the Coral Adventurer left \"without my mum\", whom she described as healthy, active, a keen gardener and bushwalker.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense,\" she said on Thursday.It's understood that Suzanne Rees, from New South Wales, was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, which had left Cairns earlier this week.Passengers, who pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the cruise, were transported to the exclusive island for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, but broke away from the others as she needed to rest. \"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" Katherine said. \"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"Katherine said she hoped a coronial inquiry would \"find out what the company should have done that might have saved Mum's life\".The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said it was investigating the death and would meet the ship's crew when it is due to dock in Darwin later this week.A spokesperson for Amsa said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Saturday by the ship's captain.A search party returned to the island a few hours later but efforts to find Suzanne were called off in the early hours of Sunday before a helicopter returned in the morning and found her body. On Wednesday, the chief executive of Coral Expeditions said the company was \"deeply sorry\" for the death and were offering their support to the Rees family. \"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is under way,\" Mark Fifield said. The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Incidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze told the BBC.\"Sneaking ashore or [back] onboard just isn't an option,\" she said.Cruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening. This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off,\" Ms Mallinson added.",

    "body": "Israel has received via the Red Cross in Gaza two coffins which the Palestinian armed group Hamas says contain the bodies of deceased hostages, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.Israeli forces will now transfer the bodies to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Hamas's armed wing announced earlier that it had recovered the bodies of Israeli hostages Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch.On Tuesday, the Israeli government accused Hamas of violating the Gaza ceasefire deal after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza.It said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage whose body had been recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023.The Israeli military also released footage filmed by a drone that showed Hamas members removing a body bag containing the remains from a building in Gaza City, reburying it, and then staging the discovery in front of Red Cross staff.The Red Cross said its staff were unaware that the body bag had been moved before their arrival and that the staged recovery was \"unacceptable\".Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".Hours later, the Israeli government accused Hamas of another ceasefire violation, saying the group's fighters had killed an Israeli soldier in an attack in an area of southern Gaza.Hamas claimed it was not involved in the incident in the Rafah area, but Israel's prime minister ordered a wave of air strikes across Gaza on Tuesday night in response. The Israeli military said it attacked \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\".Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 104 Palestinians were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, making it the deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.US President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire agreement, which his administration brokered along with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, but he added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.Under the deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Eleven of the 13 dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, in which more than 68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondent in LeidenReutersInitial exit polls had put D66 Leader Rob Jetten (left) in the lead, while Geert Wilders' Freedom Party has lost groundRob Jetten's centrist-liberal party D66 are in a neck-and-neck race with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders in the Dutch election, according to almost complete results.With almost 99% of votes counted, both D66 and Wilders' Freedom Party were  heading for 26 seats in the 150-member parliament, a projection from Dutch news agency ANP said on Thursday.Initial exit polls had put Jetten in the lead. \"Millions of Dutch people have turned a page; they've said goodbye to a politics of negativity,\" he told supporters.A downbeat Wilders had earlier conceded the result was not what he wanted, having lost 11 seats, but said he had still achieved his second best result ever.But as the final results trickled in on Thursday, the race became so close that the lead flipped between the two frontrunners. Then, the last preliminary results came in from the capital Amsterdam and Rob Jetten's liberals moved significantly ahead by more than 15,000 votes.Both parties were below 17% of the national vote, and three other parties were not far behind, including the conservative-liberal VVD on 22 seats, followed by the left-wing GreenLeft-Labour party and the Christian Democrats.Wilders led the polls throughout the election campaign, but after he pulled the plug on his own coalition in June in a row over asylum and migration, all the mainstream leaders made clear they did not wish to work with him again.He admits he has little hope of forming a government himself, but said on X on Thursday that if his party did top the vote he should have the first try. Even without a clear-cut victory, Jetten - who staged a remarkable campaign - would stand a stronger chance of leading the next administration.Only a few weeks ago, the polls put D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - on just 12 seats.But the photogenic, 38-year-old liberal leader capitalised on polished performances in a succession of TV debates and interviews. The fact that he also competed in a TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the weeks leading to the vote only added to his public profile.EPARob Jetten, 38, led a highly polished campaign and outperformed his rivals in TV debatesJetten was careful not to claim victory on Wednesday night, despite the party mood among his supporters.The conservative liberal VVD of Dilan Yesilgöz was also heading for a successful night in third place and her party would be a good fit for any potential Jetten-led coalition.Going into Wednesday's election, voters knew the result would be on a knife-edge, as five parties were in the running to win. Wilders' PVV Freedom Party won 37 seats in November 2023, but many of those voters will have been put off by the realisation he would struggle to find parties to work with him again.It took seven months for Wilders to reach a deal with coalition partners in 2024, only to bring down the government 11 months later. Rob Jetten made clear he was looking for a broad-based coalition that was both \"stable and ambitious\", and he pointed out it was unprecedented for the winning party to score fewer than 30 seats in parliament.He named the Labour-GreenLeft party of former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans as one potential coalition partner, along with Yesilgöz's conservative-liberal VVD and the revitalised Christian Democrats.That may not be easy as Yesilgöz has vowed not to work with the left. Another option is JA21, a populist right-wing party with 9 MPs, but that would leave him just short of the 76-seat majority he needs.SEM VAN DER WAL/ANP/AFPDilan Yesilgöz (R) also had a good election after good performances in TV debatesThe exit poll spelt bad news for Frans Timmermans, whose left-wing party had long been second in the polls and is now set to come fourth. \"Better times lie ahead,\" he promised his supporters late on Wednesday. \"Of course I'm hugely disappointed,\" he added, and announced he was stepping down and taking responsibility for the result.Timmermans and Wilders are both in their early 60s and entered politics at the same time, and there is now a sense that Dutch voters are prepared to try something new.Wilders, however, said he was going nowhere: \"You won't be rid of me until I'm 80.\" He remained bullish about his Freedom Party's performance: \"I would naturally rather have seen more seats... but we have still had our second best result.\"Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam said Wilders' party had lost the support of many of its moderate voters to other parties as well as many on the more radical side.But, he said, \"the losses could have been worse\", given that Wilders had himself broken up the last coalition and had campaigned less actively than his rivals.Anna Holligan/BBCSupporters of Jetten's centrist liberals were overjoyed with the surprise resultThere was palpable excitement as D66 supporters gathered for the results at a music venue in Leiden, a university city between Amsterdam and The Hague. As the exit polls became clear, the words \"yes, we can\" were voiced repeatedly as a kind of party mantra in the hall.Taking to the stage, the man now tipped to be the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch history told supporters \"we did it - the best result D66 has ever achieved\".\"We also know that millions of Dutch people voted for other parties, and I also feel a very heavy responsibility for [all of them],\" said Rob Jetten. \"We will do all we can in the coming years to show all the Dutch people that politics and government can be there for them again so they can think big again and act big again so the Netherlands can move forward.\"This election was partly fought on migration and overcrowded asylum centres, but the biggest issue for voters was the chronic housing shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Jetten's party has said it will build 10 cities as part of its plan to tackle the crisis.\"It was a campaign of optimism, it shows the Dutch are tired of two years of standstill, we recognise big challenges and we want progress on those,\" said D66 supporter Eline. \"It shows the Dutch are craving a prime minister who is able to unite the country and tackle the major challenges our country and the world are facing.\"Another potential coalition partner for the liberals is the Christian Democrats, who only two years ago looked down and out with just a handful of seats. Now they are projected to win 18. \"What a fantastic result - two years ago we could not have dared to dream of this,\" CDA leader Henri Bontenbal told supporters as they chanted his name.",

    "body": "9 hours agoHugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  and Samantha Granville,BeirutReutersThe Israeli military said it was conducting an operation to \"dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure\" (file photo)Israeli troops carried out an incursion into a south Lebanese town overnight, killing a municipal employee, state media report, amid an escalation of Israeli attacks in Lebanon.The troops, accompanied by drones and light armoured vehicles, entered Blida and stormed the town hall, where the employee - named as Ibrahim Salameh - was sleeping, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency.The Israeli military said its troops were conducting an operation to \"dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure\", without providing evidence that the building was being used by the group.Israel's operation drew a furious response in Lebanon, where a ceasefire ended a war between them last November.Israel's military says troops encountered a \"suspect\" inside the building and opened fire when an \"immediate threat\" was identified, it added. It was not clear whether Salameh had been the target of the operation.Israel has stepped up its attacks on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim group backed by Iran.The Lebanese President, Joseph Aoun, instructed the commander of the Lebanese army to confront any Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon.Prime Minister Nawaf Salam denounced the killing of Salameh and the incursion as a \"flagrant violation of Lebanese institutions and sovereignty\".He said Lebanon would continue pressing the United Nations and ceasefire guarantors \"to ensure a halt to the repeated violations and the implementation of a complete Israeli withdrawal from our lands\".Protests were held on Thursday morning in Blida and nearby towns, where residents blocked roads with burning tyres to denounce what they called a \"blatant aggression\" and the state's failure to protect civilians.AFPIsraeli aircraft carried out a strike on the outskirts of the southern Lebanese village of Jarmaq on ThursdayOver recent days, Israel intensified its strikes across Lebanon, saying it was targeting Hezbollah positions.A second Israeli operation was reported overnight in the nearby village of Adaisseh, where residents say troops blew up a religious ceremonial hall.Israeli warplanes also flew over parts of southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley on Thursday, while drones were again seen circling low above Beirut's southern suburbs.During a meeting of ceasefire monitors on Wednesday, US envoy Morgan Ortagus said Washington welcomed Lebanon's \"decision to bring all weapons under state control by the end of the year\", adding that the Lebanese army \"must now fully implement its plan\".Under the ceasefire agreement, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to move its fighters north of the Litani river and dismantle its military infrastructure there - a plan the group and its allies strongly oppose.Only the Lebanese army and the UN peacekeeping force, Unifil, are authorised to deploy armed personnel in the area south of the Litani, but Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites.",

    "body": "9 hours agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiNurPhoto via Getty ImagesIndia has faced increasingly intense heatwaves in recent yearsAlmost one-third of the heatwave days India experienced in 2024 were driven by climate change, according to a new report by the medical journal The Lancet.The report found that India recorded an average of 19.8 heatwave days last year, of which 6.6 days would not have occurred without human-induced climate change.It also estimated that heat exposure in 2024 resulted in the loss of 247 billion potential labour hours, mostly in the agriculture and construction sectors. amounting to an economic loss of about $194bn (£151bn).While heatwaves are not new to India, their frequency and intensity have been rising steadily over the past few decades because of global warming.Prolonged exposure to extreme heat has serious repercussions on health. It can overwhelm the body's ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of dehydration, heatstroke, cardiovascular stress, and even death - particularly among the elderly, infants and outdoor workers.And the 2025 Lancet Countdown report - which tracks the health impact of climate change and is widely regarded as a key scientific reference on the issue - warns that the health risks posed by rising global temperatures are now more severe than ever.\"Throughout last year,152 record-breaking extreme weather events were registered across 61 countries, and life-threatening, extreme heat events are becoming more intense than previously predicted,\" the report stated. \"The climate crisis is a health crisis. Every fraction of a degree of warming costs lives and livelihoods,\" said Jeremy Farrar, assistant director-general for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care at the World Health Organization (WHO). The report found that heat-related mortality has increased by 23% worldwide since the 1990s, with an average of around 546,000 deaths each year.ReutersIndia is among the most polluted countries in the worldIt also found that the average person worldwide was exposed to 16 days of extreme heat last year that would not have occurred without climate change.\"This [report] paints a bleak and undeniable picture of the devastating health harms reaching all corners of the world,\" said Dr Marina Romanello, of University College London, who led the report's analysis. \"The destruction to lives and livelihoods will continue to escalate until we end our fossil fuel addiction,\" she added.Air QualityThe report also mentioned that India's air quality has worsened over the past few years. Every year as the winter sets in, the air quality in the Indo-Gangetic plains turns toxic. This year too, the air quality has remained between poor and very poor category - at times, reaching hazardous - for almost a month now. The report mentioned that 1.7 million deaths in 2022 were caused due to atmospheric pollution, particularly because of the tiny PM2.5 pollutants that can cause a host of serious health issues. Harmful emissions from burning fossil fuel led to 44% of these deaths. It also noted that the heavy reliance on biofuels such as wood, dung and crop residue for cooking continues to silently claim thousands of lives across the country - especially among women and children in rural areas.The report was released ahead of the COP30 summit, which is going to take place in Brazil next month.

    "body": "1 day agoIan Aikman and Elettra NeysmithMessages in a bottle written by two Australian soldiers in 1916 have been found more than a century later on the country's south-western coast.The cheerful notes were penned just a few days into their voyage to join the battlefields of France during World War One. One of the soldiers, Pte Malcolm Neville, told his mother that the food on board was \"real good\" and that they were \"as happy as Larry\". Months later, he was killed in action at the age of 28. The other soldier, 37-year-old Pte William Harley, survived the war and returned home.The letters have been passed on to their descendants, who have been stunned by the discovery.The bottle was found earlier this month on the remote Wharton Beach, near Esperance in Western Australia, by local resident Deb Brown and her family.She was visiting the beach with her husband and daughter on one of their regular quad bike trips to clear up litter, when they spotted a thick glass bottle in the sand, she said on Tuesday.\"We do a lot of cleaning up on our beaches and so would never go past a piece of rubbish. So this little bottle was lying there waiting to be picked up,\" Ms Brown told the Associated Press news agency.Though the paper was wet, both letters were still legible, so Ms Brown began tracking down the soldiers' families in order to pass them on.Ms Brown located Pte Neville's great-nephew, Herbie Neville, by searching for the soldier's name and the town he was from online, as his mother's address was included in the note.Mr Neville told ABC News the experience had been \"unbelievable\" for his family.The second letter, written by Pte William Harley, was addressed simply to whoever found the bottle. His mother had died years earlier.Pte Harley's granddaughter, Ann Turner, told ABC she and the soldier's four other surviving grandchildren were \"absolutely stunned\" by the message.\"It really does feel like a miracle and we do very much feel like our grandfather has reached out for us from the grave,\" she said.\"I feel very emotional when I see that the other young man had a mother to write to, and that message in the bottle was to his mother, whereas our grandfather long ago had lost his mother so he just writes it to the finder of the bottle.\"The bottle was thrown overboard \"somewhere in the Bight\", Pte Harley's letter said, referring to the Great Australian Bight off the country's southern coast.An oceanography professor told ABC it may only have been in the water for a few weeks before it landed at Wharton Beach, where it may have remained buried for 100 years.",

    "body": "The French parliament has ratified an amendment to add consent to the legal definition of sexual assault and rape.Previously, rape or sexual abuse in France had been defined as \"any form of sexual penetration committed with the use of violence, coercion, threat or surprise\".Now, the law will say that all sexual acts done to another without consent constitute rape.The change is the result of a cross-party, years-long debate which gained renewed urgency after last year's Pelicot rape trial, in which 50 men were found guilty of sexually assaulting or raping Gisèle Pelicot while she had been drugged unconscious by her husband Dominique.The defence of many of the accused hinged on the fact they could not be guilty of rape because they were unaware Ms Pelicot was not in a position to give her consent.Some defence lawyers in the Pelicot case had therefore argued that there could be no crime without the intention to commit it.The new bill will make this argument more tenuous, as it says that consent must be \"free and informed, specific, prior and revocable\".Consent will have to be evaluated according to the circumstances, the new law says, noting that it cannot be inferred from \"silence or lack of reaction\".\"There is no consent if the sexual act is committed through violence, coercion, threat or surprise, whatever their nature,\" it states.The two MPs who drafted the amendment - the Greens' Marie-Charlotte Garin and centrist Véronique Riotton - said a \"historic victory\" had been achieved and hailed \"a major step forward in the fight against sexual violence\".Some critics of the amendment had argued it would result in sexual relations turning into \"contracts\". Others were concerned that the changes could force victims of rape to prove they had not consented.But France's highest administrative court, the Council of State (Conseil d'État) said in March that it was backing the amendment, saying that it would \"clearly express... that sexual assaults infringe upon the fundamental principle of everyone's personal and sexual freedom\".An initial version was adopted by the National Assembly in April. Its progression was delayed by France's current political turmoil, but on Wednesday the Senate definitively adopted the bill, with 327 votes in favour and 15 abstentions. It then went back to parliament, which gave it final approval.Last year Greens senator Mélanie Vogel argued that while society had \"already accepted the fact that the difference between sex and rape is consent\" but that criminal law had not kept up.\"This is a historic step forward, following in the footsteps of several other European countries,\" Lola Schulmann, advocacy officer at Amnesty International France, told AFP on Wednesday.Sweden, Germany and Spain are among the European countries that already have consent-based rape laws.",

    "body": "Romania's defence ministry has said the US intends to reduce some of its troops stationed on Nato's eastern flank.Between 900 and 1,000 American troops will remain in Romania, Bucharest said - down from 1,700. The ministry said the decision was expected and that the \"resizing\" of US forces was a result of the new priorities of the Trump presidential administration.The Pentagon said the decision did not constitute a \"withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to Nato and Article 5\". Article 5 holds that Nato members will come to the defence of an ally which comes under attack, and has long been seen as the main deterrent against potential Russian aggression.Defence Minister Ionut Mosteanu stated that his US counterpart Pete Hegseth had recently conveyed to the Europeans that they needed to pay more attention to their own defence and that the US was shifting its attention towards the Indo-Pacific region.One US brigade at the Mihai Kogalniceanu airbase - set to be Nato's largest in Europe - would be rotated out and not replaced, Mosteanu said.The brigade has \"elements\" in Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, Mosteanu said, although it was unclear whether US troops were going to be pulled out of these countries too.Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Wednesday that Warsaw had \"no information\" about a possible reduction of US troops on its territory. The presence of US troops at Romania's Deveselu and Campia Turzii bases would remain unchanged, Ionut Mosteanu added.Since taking office in January US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his wish to shift the focus of US military commitment from Europe to the Indo-Pacific region, and has repeatedly urged European Nato members to take more responsibility for the continent's defence.But the announcement of the US troop withdrawal from Romania will be concerning for Eastern European countries, many of which feel they have reason to fear a Russian attack in the future.Shortly after the announcement from Bucharest, a Nato official stressed that Washington's commitment to the Nato alliance remained \"clear\" and adjustments were \"not unusual\".\"Even with this adjustment, the US force posture in Europe remains larger than it has been for many years, with many more US forces on the continent than before 2022,\" the official said in a statement.The Pentagon also stressed that the US maintained a \"robust presence\" throughout Europe as well as \"the ability to array forces and capabilities to meet objectives... including President Trump's commitment to defend Nato allies\".The US has more than 100,000 military personnel deployed in Europe, according to figures from late last year.Last month Nato announced the creation of a mission dubbed Eastern Sentry, which it said would enhance the alliance's vigilance along the entire eastern flank. The decision came after a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace, in the most serious incident of its kind since the war began in February 2022. Days later,  Romania reported that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, and Estonia said Russian warplanes had violated its airspace too.",

    "body": "Trump caps refugee admissions at record low - with most to be white South Africans1 hour agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesTrump criticised South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\"The Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.The move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.No reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was \"justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest\".In January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety. The previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.The notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years. The tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.The South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.Watch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turnOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".The US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups. Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in USIs there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Some have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East. \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\" \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added. The South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement. During the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".Earlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. While the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. ",

Mr Cohen's statement deepens the long-drawn dispute between the world-famous ice cream maker and Unilever, the British packaged goods giant which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000.The co-founders said Unilever and Magnum, which is in the process of being spun off from its parent company, had unlawfully blocked their company from \"honouring its social mission\".But Magnum said: \"The independent members of Ben & Jerry's Board are not, and have never been, responsible for the Ben & Jerry's commercial strategy and execution.\"It said the company would continue to focus on \"ongoing, impactful campaigns close to its communities\", including campaigning for improved conditions in refugee accommodation in the UK, and freedom of speech rights in the United States.  Mr Cohen said in an Instagram video on Tuesday that he is creating a new watermelon-flavoured sorbet, calling for ideas for the product's name and what ingredients should be added.The watermelon has become a symbol for solidarity with Palestinians due to its colours, which are similar to those of the Palestinian flag – red, green, black and white. The American entrepreneur said Ben & Jerry's were prevented by Unilever from creating the dessert.\"I'm doing what they couldn't,\" Mr Cohen says from his set in a kitchen. \"I'm making a watermelon-flavoured ice cream that calls for permanent peace in Palestine and calls for repairing the damage that was done there.\"In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel. Its Israeli operation was sold by Unilever to a local licensee, allowing its ice cream to continue being sold in the occupied West Bank.The dessert series will be developed under Ben's Best, Mr Cohen's activist ice cream brand, he said in a statement to the press. The flavour is being produced independently of Ben & Jerry's, the statement said.Ben's Best was first setup in 2016 to support former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with the flavour \"Bernie's Back\". Mr Cohen said he will develop other ice cream flavours that speak to the issues Ben & Jerry's was silenced from addressing publicly by Unilever.In September, co-founder Jerry Greenfield stepped down from Ben & Jerry's after decades at the company, citing concerns that its independence had been compromised following Unilever's decision to curb its social activism.At the time, Ben Cohen said that \"Jerry has a really big heart and this conflict with Unilever was breaking it.\"\"My heart leads me to continue to work inside the company to advocate for its independence so that it can actualise the social mission, the values that it was founded on and has maintained for over 40 years,\" he told the BBC's PM programme.",

    "body": "3 hours agoVanessa Buschschlüter and Rute Pina,BBC Brasil, reporting from São PauloBruno ItanDozens of bodies were laid out in a square in Penha, in northern Rio, after the deadliest police raid in the city's historyA photographer who witnessed the aftermath of a massive Brazilian police operation in Rio de Janeiro has told the BBC of how residents came back with mutilated bodies of those who had died.The bodies \"kept coming: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45...\", Bruno Itan told BBC Brasil. They included those of police officers.One of the bodies had been decapitated - others were \"totally disfigured\", he said. Many also had what he says were stab wounds. More than 120 people were killed during Tuesday's raid on a criminal gang - the deadliest such raid in the city.EPA/ShutterstockMore than 100 people were arrested as part of the operationBruno Itan told BBC Brasil that he was first alerted to the raid early on Tuesday by residents of the Alemão neighbourhood, who sent him messages telling him there was a shoot-out. The photographer made his way to the Getúlio Vargas hospital, where the bodies were arriving.Itan says that the police stopped members of the press from entering the Penha neighbourhood, where the operation was under way. \"Police officers formed a line and said: 'The press doesn't get past here.'\"But Itan, who grew up in the area, says he was able to make his way into the cordoned-off area, where he remained until the next morning. He says that Tuesday night, local residents began to search the hillside which divides Penha from the nearby Alemão neighbourhood for relatives who had been missing since the police raid.Bruno ItanResidents of the Penha neighbourhood proceeded to place the recovered bodies in a  square - and Itan's photos show the reaction of the people there. \"The brutality of it all impacted me a lot: the sorrow of the families, mothers fainting, pregnant wives, crying, outraged parents,\" the photographer recalled.Bruno ItanThere was shock in Penha as locals retrieved more and more bodies from the nearby  hillsideThe governor of Rio state said that the massive police operation involving around 2,500 security personnel was aimed at stopping a criminal group known as Comando Vermelho (Red Command) from expanding its territory.Initially, the Rio state government maintained that \"60 suspects and four police officers\" had been killed in the operation.They have since said that their \"preliminary\" count shows that 117 \"suspects\" have been killed.Rio's public defender's office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, has put the total number of people killed at 132.According to researchers, Red Command is the only criminal group which in recent years has managed to make territorial gains in the state of Rio de Janeiro.It is widely considered one of the two largest gangs in the country, alongside First Capital Command (PCC), and has a history dating back more than 50 years. According to Brazilian journalist Rafael Soares, who has been covering crime in Rio for years, Red Command \"operates like a franchise\" with local criminal leaders forming part of the gang and becoming \"business partners\".The gang engages primarily in drug trafficking, but also smuggles guns, gold, fuel, alcohol and tobacco.According to the authorities, gang members are well armed and police said that during the raid, they came under attack from explosive-laden drones. The governor of Rio state, Cláudio Castro, described Red Command members as \"narcoterrorists\" and called the four police officers killed in the raid \"heroes\".But the number of people killed in the operation has come in for criticism with the  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights saying it was \"horrified\".At a news conference on Wednesday, Governor Castro defended the police force.\"It wasn't our intention to kill anyone. We wanted to arrest them all alive,\" he said.He added that the situation had escalated because the suspects had retaliated: \"It was a consequence of the retaliation they carried out and the disproportionate use of force by those criminals.\"The governor also said that the bodies displayed by locals in Penha had been \"manipulated\". In a post on X, he said that some of them had been stripped of the camouflage clothing he said they had been wearing \"in order to shift blame onto the police\".Felipe Curi of Rio's civil police force also said that \"camouflage clothing, vests, and weapons\" had been removed from the bodies and showed footage appearing to show a man cutting camouflage clothing off a corpse. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has summoned Governor Castro to a hearing on Monday to explain the police actions \"in detail\".With additional reporting by BBC Brasil's Carol Castro in Rio de Janeiro.",

    "body": "8 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersPrecious crown jewels were taken during the theft earlier this monthFive more suspects have been arrested over their involvement in the Louvre heist, Paris' public prosecutor has said.They were detained on Wednesday night in the Paris region during coordinated raids, according to Laure Beccuau. One of the suspects is thought to be part of the four-man team that carried out the heist, who were seen on CCTV. Two of the other alleged thieves have already been arrested and have \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the brazen theft, while the fourth person has not yet been caught. It is not clear what role the other newly arrested people allegedly played in the theft, but Beccuau told French radio station RTL on Thursday that they \"may eventually inform us about how the incident took place\".Beccuau said the arrests had been made in areas in and around Paris, including the  suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis.Phones and other objects found on the suspects during the raid were allowing investigators to study encrypted messages, she added.Those arrested can be detained for up to four days before being charged or released.How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftFrench investigators are not giving many more details away at this stage but Beccuau said that DNA from one of those arrested on Wednesday night could be linked to the crime scene. \"We had him in our sights,\" she said of the main suspect. She specified that the latest arrests were not related to statements made by the previously detained suspects but to \"other elements of the case\".The authorities have previously said that the gang involved in the heist could be bigger than those who physically stole the jewels.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the Louvre - the world's most-visited museum - on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight. The precious jewels have not been recovered yet.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe first two people who were arrested over the heist - both men in their thirties with criminal records - are thought to be the pair who used power tools to enter the museum's  Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) and steal some of the French crown jewels.They were taken into custody late last week. Beccuau told a press conference on Wednesday that one of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but that the other man had not been planning to leave France, contrary to earlier media reports.There was no evidence at this stage to suggest the theft was an inside job, she added, confirming no accomplices worked at the museum. On the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30, just after the museum opened to visitors, Beccuau said at a press conference on Wednesday.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Gallery of Apollo via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Beccuau said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars and heading east. Nobody had been threatened during the raid. France's justice minister said security protocols in the Louvre - one of the world's most famous museums - \"failed\" in preventing the theft. It was later revealed by the Louvre's director that the only camera monitoring the Gallery of Apollo was pointing away from a balcony the thieves climbed over to break in. Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicle",

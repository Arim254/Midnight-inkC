Democrats have hoped to capitalise on the impasse to ensure health insurance subsidies for those with low-income do not expire and reverse the Trump administration's cuts to the Medicaid health programme. </p><p>Republicans, for their part, have repeatedly accused Democrats of shutting down the government in a bid to provide <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vzyl5x15ro\">healthcare to undocumented immigrants</a> - a charge that Democratic leaders have denied. </p><p>A total of 54 Senators voted in favour of a Republican-led proposal to fund the government, with 44 against and two not voting. </p><p>A separate, Democrat-led proposal also failed, with 45 voting in favour and 52 against. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjyzv6vv8o\">'No good outcome' - voters across US share concerns about shutdown</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg201rnw2zo\">Trump wields axe over 'Democrat Agencies' as shutdown blame game rages</a></li></ul><p>Both sides have continued to blame the other for the shutdown, with little sign of any progress in negotiations. </p><p>\"We can vote and vote and vote,\" Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley told the BBC. \"But it's up to basically five people.\" </p><p>During a news briefing at the White House, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of holding Americans \"hostage over their demands\". </p><p>\"The economic consequences of this shut down are piling up every day,\" she added, noting that $15bn (Â£11.1bn) in GDP could be lost each week as unemployment rises. </p><p>White House officials have repeatedly vowed to lay off federal workers if the shutdown continues, and earlier this week President Donald Trump posted that he would meet with Russell Vought, who heads OMB, to examine \"which of the many Democrat agencies\" that should be cut. </p><p>The White House has provided no scope or timeline for any potential lay-offs or cuts to agencies. Leavitt said that most of those cuts would come from agencies that \"do not align with this administration's values of putting our country first\". </p><p>As part of the federal government's response to the shut down, Vought on Friday announced the suspension of $2.1bn in federal infrastructure funding for Chicago, in addition to the previous freezing of $18bn in infrastructure spending in New York City and the cancellation of approximately $8bn in funding for federal energy projects in some Democratic-run states. </p><p>On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democrats are fighting the healthcare issue because \"we know Americans want this\". </p><p>\"And we know many of my Republican colleagues want this as well,\" he said. \"But failure to act would be devastating, and Republicans know it.\" </p><p>Some Democrats - including Connecticut Senator Richard Bluementhal and Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman - said they want to hear directly from the president about the ongoing stalemate. </p><p>Citing a bipartisan border bill that the president ultimately rejected last year, they said they fear that any negotiations with Senate Republicans could ultimately be contradicted by Trump. </p><p>Early polls have suggested that Americans are deeply split on the shutdown, with one Washington Post poll conducted on 1 October finding that 47% of US adults blame Republicans, compared to 30% who blame Democrats. </p><p>Another 23% said they were unsure.</p><p><i>(With additional reporting from Cai Pigliucci on Capitol Hill)</i></p></div>",

The national energy watchdog and Spanish lawmakers are also conducting separate investigations.</p><p>The Spanish government believes the Entso-e report supports its own findings.</p><p>Sara Aagesen, minister for ecological transition, said it was \"completely in line\" with the results of an investigation it commissioned which concluded in June that both the national grid provider Red ElÃ©ctrica and private electricity companies were at fault.</p><p>Both Red ElÃ©ctrica and the private firms have insisted that they were not to blame. Redeia, owner of Red ElÃ©ctrica, has blamed the blackout on some coal, gas and nuclear power plants' failure to help maintain appropriate voltage.</p><p>Spanish utilities said it was caused by poor planning from grid operators.</p><p>The Entso-e report also said some important data was missing and that \"collecting complete, high-quality data proved very challenging for this investigation\".</p><p>A final report, to be published in the first quarter of next year, will investigate the root causes of the overvoltage and the actions employed to control voltage in the system.</p></div><div><p>The outage triggered a broader debate that spilled into the political arena about Spain's energy model.</p><p>The opposition suggested an increasingly heavy reliance on renewable energy, promoted by the left-wing government of Pedro SÃ¡nchez, could have been a factor in causing the blackout and the country's decreasing supply of nuclear energy meant a dependable back-up was not available.</p><p>The government roundly rejected these theories and the new report was careful to avoid taking sides when it came to the causes of April's unprecedented blackout.</p><p>The loss of power forced Madrid Open Tennis organisers to stop a match half way through play. </p><p>Spain's nuclear power plants automatically stopped when the blackout hit, and the Spanish oil company Moeve said it halted operations at its oil refineries.</p><p>Buildings <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c175ykvjxyeo\">were plunged into darkness</a>, while mobile phones and traffic lights stopped working. Queues snaked around street corners and card payments failed, forcing people to queue for cash and cram on to buses as other transport systems were not running. </p><p>Emergency workers were called to 286 buildings to free people trapped inside elevators in the Madrid region and hospitals implemented emergency plans, halting routine procedures. </p></div>",

It was, he said, deliberate and the activity had increased since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Britain has half a dozen dedicated military satellites in orbit providing communications and surveillance. </p><p>In contrast, the US, China and Russia each have more than a hundred. The combined Russian and Chinese fleet of satellites has increased by 70% over the past decade. </p><p>Gen Tedman said Russia and China had both tested anti-satellite weapons. Both the UK and the US have warned that Russia has been developing the capability to put nuclear weapons in space. </p><p>While the US sees China as the pacing threat, Gen Tedman sees Russia as the more immediate danger: \"I would say the Chinese have by far the more sophisticated capability but the Russians have more will to use their counter-space systems.\"</p><p>Gen Tedman said he was \"really worried\" about what was happening in space â not just the threats but the increasing congestion. There are currently about 45,000 objects in orbit including around 9,000 satellites. This year will see another 300 rocket launches into space.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2da/live/fca4cfe0-9fb2-11f0-8410-854cfa733f11.jpg.webp\" alt=\"UK MoD A man wearing protective gear fixes the Tyche satellite in a laboratory.\n\" /><span>UK MoD</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Tyche is the MoD's first wholly owned Earth observation satellite. </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>The general was speaking on a visit to RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. It is home to Britain and America's Ballistic Missile Early Warning System. It is a job they has been doing since 1963.</p><p>The three famous large radomes or \"golf balls\" from the Cold War era have been replaced by a 30-metre (98-ft) pyramid which houses thousands of antennas.</p><p>It looks like a spaceship has landed on the North Yorkshire moors, surrounded by sheep, an electrified perimeter fence and razor wire. </p><p>The unblinking eye provides 360 degree coverage from the Arctic to North Africa, and from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Its radar can track objects the size of a tin can, 3,000 miles (4,800km) into space.</p><p>Inside, the heavy blast doors and air locks tell you that his too could be a target for any adversary. In the operations room, UK military personnel watch round the clock, every day of the year. </p><p>The RAF's 2 Space Warning Squadron take us through the drill of how they detect a missile launch. They are plugged into other US satellites and sensors that enable them to detect a launch anywhere in the world. </p><p>Gen Tedman calls space \"a team sport\" but, in reality, the UK is heavily reliant on America. The US has responsibility for the maintenance of the radar with the support of UK contractors.</p><p>The UK officer in charge of the watch says along with other sources \"we'd know the UK was under threat probably within a minute\".</p><p>What is mentioned less is the UK's ability to intercept ballistic missiles. Currently the UK has very little in the way of ballistic missile defence.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abdc/live/18086fc0-9fd2-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.png.webp\" alt=\"The exterior of the air force base.

It is also taking steps to defend its satellites. This week it is announcing it will test sensors to detect laser threats in space.</p><p>Both China and Russia have developed lasers which could be used to dazzle and disrupt an adversary's satellites. </p><p>Gen Tedman said: \"We've committed to invest a billion pounds into integrated air and missile defence, and I'd be surprised if there's not a space aspect to how we're going to defend the UK from threats very similar to [America's] Golden Dome.\"</p><p>He was referring to President Donald Trump's plan to build a shield around the US against any missile attacks. </p><p>However, the UK is in danger of being left behind in the space race. Currently it spends about 1% of its defence budget on space. In contrast, France spends about 3% and the US 5%.</p><p>Gen Tedman would like to see space given a higher priority. He says around Â£450bn  of the UK economy is dependent on space. It is also the nervous system on which the UK's armed forces increasingly depend â from navigation to precision strikes.</p><p>Before we leave RAF Fylingdales, there is another reminder why space is so important. </p><p>We are warned we will have to leave the operations room if there is a real-life incident. While we are filming another alert comes through of a ballistic missile launch and we are swiftly escorted to the exit. </p><p>They are observing short-range ballistic missile launches almost every day. In this incident they will not say from where but it is no secret Russia has been firing them regularly into Ukraine. </p><p>In 2024 more than 4,000 missiles were fired around the globe. Russia was the reason why Flyingdales was first created in the Cold War era. The threat has not gone away.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, âTop political analysis in your inbox every dayâ.

Women and children are suffering, and she needs to work for peace and reconciliation.\"</p><p>That places Bishop Onyango at odds with the archbishop of her country, who is part of Gafcon's leadership.</p><p>When I asked the Archbishop of Rwanda whether this moment could prove to be an irreparable rupture in the worldwide Anglican Communion, he texted me that \"nothing is irreparable with God, but it requires repentance.</p><p>\"Gafcon has always called for erring church leaders to repent and return to the Bible's teaching. But until they do so, we cannot walk with them in their apostasy.\"</p></div>",

By then, crowds of supporters were chanting her name.</p><p>On Monday GisÃ¨le Pelicot returns to court, this time in NÃ®mes, for the appeal of the only one of the 51 defendants to challenge his sentence: Husamettin Dogan, 44, a married father of one.</p><p>Between September and December last year, GisÃ¨le's bleak story travelled the world. For over a decade, she had been drugged unconscious by her husband Dominique and raped by dozens of men he had recruited on internet chat rooms.</p><p>Dominique Pelicot filmed the assaults and neatly catalogued them on a hard disk, which allowed investigators to track down the majority of the individuals involved. Around 20 could not be identified and remain at large.</p><p>After a trial lasting 16 weeks, 46 men were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two of sexual assault. Dominique Pelicot was handed the maximum jail sentence of 20 years.</p><p>Husamettin Dogan's appeal next week will, in effect, be a retrial. The videos of GisÃ¨le's rape will be shown in court again, and Pelicot will be present â this time, though, only as a witness.</p><p>While she is not obliged to, GisÃ¨le too will attend the proceedings.</p><p>\"Everyone would have understood if she hadn't come because, well, she is trying to resume a normal life,\" one of her lawyers, StÃ©phane Babonneau, told the BBC. \"But she feels she needs to be there and has a responsibility to be there until the end of the proceedings.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7399/live/c1890990-a065-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7399/live/c1890990-a065-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7399/live/c1890990-a065-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7399/live/c1890990-a065-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7399/live/c1890990-a065-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7399/live/c1890990-a065-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7399/live/c1890990-a065-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7399/live/c1890990-a065-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"EPA GisÃ¨le Pelicot framed at the centre of a dramatic wide-angle shot inside the courthouse, with a huge crowd of journalists surrounding her with microphones\" /><span>EPA</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>GisÃ¨le Pelicot was hailed around the world for her courage in publicly confronting her rapists</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>In December, Dogan was found guilty of aggravated rape and sentenced to nine years in prison. Due to health reasons he was handed a deferred custody warrant and is not currently in jail. He is reportedly appealing both the guilty verdict and the length of his sentence.</p><p>As was the case for many of the other 51 men, Dogan's defence hinged on the argument he could not be guilty of raping GisÃ¨le because he had not realised she would be unconscious. Pelicot rejected this argument, saying he had made it abundantly clear to the men he recruited online that his wife would be drugged.</p><p>In his statement to the court last year Dogan did admit telling Pelicot that his wife \"looked dead\". Still, he vehemently pushed back against the accusations levelled at him. \"I don't accept being labelled a rapist,\" he protested. \"It's too heavy a burden for me to carry.\"</p><p>Although 16 other defendants also initially lodged appeals, Dogan was the only one who has pushed ahead with it.</p><p>Unlike the first trial, Dogan's appeal will be judged by a jury made up of nine members of the public who will decide on both his conviction and the length of his jail term.</p></div><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd75v8eqz44o\">GisÃ¨le Pelicot: How an ordinary woman shook attitudes to rape in France</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c390d8nd4n4o\">What you need to know about the Pelicot case</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgx7xy77ydo\">New name, no photos: GisÃ¨le Pelicot removes all trace of her husband</a></li></ul></div><div><p>If he loses his appeal, the trial's huge resonance and media coverage may mean the jury ends up being less lenient than the judges were last December.</p><p>\"It's a real risk and I think that's why so many men withdrew their appeals,\" French magistrate Magali Lafourcade told the BBC.</p><p>She believes the Pelicot case has had a significant effect on French society and that jurors are bound to have a new understanding of societal issues around rape and consent.</p><p>\"It will be interesting to see what the defendant comes up with,\" she said. \"He may try to show he has learned lessons of feminism, or that he is not a risk to society. A lot will also depend on the quality of his defence - and his lawyers know how much society has evolved this past year.\"</p><p>The proceedings, which this time will only last four days, are set to be combative.</p><p>Last year, Dogan's lawyer Sylvie Menvielle suggested the rape videos showed a \"three-way sex game\" and hinted GisÃ¨le may have been complicit.</p><p>The comments prompted an outraged GisÃ¨le to exit the courtroom mid-session for only the second time in the trial, which she otherwise followed assiduously â as she is expected to do again next week.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3660/live/cea9d3b0-a066-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3660/live/cea9d3b0-a066-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3660/live/cea9d3b0-a066-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3660/live/cea9d3b0-a066-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3660/live/cea9d3b0-a066-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3660/live/cea9d3b0-a066-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3660/live/cea9d3b0-a066-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3660/live/cea9d3b0-a066-11f0-b2f9-dd258cdb2dcd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Women demonstrate outside the courthouse in Avignon, holding placards in support of GisÃ¨le Pelicot.

This reasoning was at the heart of her decision to waive her anonymity, open the trial to the media and the public, and push for the videos of her rapes to be shown in court.</p><p>It was a momentous decision, and the reason the trial garnered worldwide resonance. Since the verdicts were handed down, GisÃ¨le Pelicot has been named one of Time's 100 most influential people. She was also awarded numerous prizes including the French Legion d'Honneur and has been sent a personal letter by Queen Camilla.</p><p>But by and large, after those months in the public eye, GisÃ¨le was able to regain the privacy she had been denied for so long. Soon after the end of the trial she retreated to Ãle de RÃ©, a small island off France's Atlantic coast.</p><p>For a time, the only images of her to emerge were occasional selfies posted by her son Florian on social media, showing her sitting by the sea, beaming at the camera.</p><p>That privacy did not last. Last spring, glossy magazine Paris Match published paparazzi pictures of her and her new partner strolling on Ãle de RÃ©.</p><p>Many noted it was yet another instance of personal images being taken and shared without her consent.

The man, in his 60s then, had denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Prosecutors later dropped charges against him as a judge disallowed the confession he made as a minor.</p><p>Authorities have conducted numerous searches in the decades since Cheryl disappeared, but have found few clues as to what happened to her. </p><p>NSW authorities have offered a A$1m ($660,000; Â£491,000) reward for information on Cheryl's abduction and suspected murder.</p><p>Cheryl's brother Ricki Nash, 62, has publicly highlighted what he believes are errors in the police investigation dating back to the day she went missing.</p><p>Mr Nash was seven then. He last saw his sister in the changing rooms at Fairy Meadow on the day she disappeared.</p><p>A petition asking the state parliament to set up an inquiry into missing persons investigations overseen by NSW Police, such as Cheryl's, gathered more than 10,000 signatures this summer.</p><p>It was debated in parliament, but in a letter responding to petitioners, state authorities made no commitment to holding an inquiry.</p><p><i>With reporting by Tiffanie Turnbull in Sydney</i></p></div>",

    "body": "11 hours agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsGetty ImagesIglesias said the allegations were \"absolutely false\"Spanish prosecutors have dropped an investigation into complaints of sexual abuse against the singer Julio Iglesias.They ruled that Spanish courts had no jurisdiction and were therefore not competent to investigate crimes committed abroad involving complainants who were not Spanish citizens or residents and who had never travelled to Spain with the star.Two female former employees had alleged that the 82-year-old Spanish superstar \"normalised abuse\" in a coercive, threatening and violent environment while they were working at his properties in the Bahamas and Dominican Republic in 2021. Iglesias has vigorously denied the allegations, which were first reported last week.On 5 January, the women filed a legal complaint for sexual assault and human trafficking with the national court, which investigates crimes allegedly committed beyond Spain's borders.Advocacy groups Women's Link Worldwide and Amnesty International said the acts alleged in the complaint could be considered \"a crime of human trafficking for the purpose of forced labour\" and \"crimes against sexual freedom\".Women's Link Worldwide described the complainants as young Latin American women \"in vulnerable situations who were heavily dependent on their wages due to their economic and social conditions\".It said the complaint was submitted in Spain because the country has legislation to protect women from gender-based violence and trafficking.But prosecutors said the fact that the complainants were not Spanish citizens or residents meant that the legal principle of universal jurisdiction could not be applied. They also argued that the states where the alleged crimes took place - the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas - had \"clear and effective competence\" to investigate the allegations themselves.Iglesias has responded to the accusations with a post on Instagram (in Spanish), in which he said: \"I deny having abused, coerced, or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and deeply sadden me.\"Several friends of the singer have also fiercely denied that he could be capable of such behaviour.Iglesias is one of the most successful Latin artists of all time, having sold more than 300 million records in a career spanning decades.He is also the father of fellow music superstar Enrique Iglesias.",

    "body": "A fracture in a straight section of track \"occurred prior to the passage\" of a high-speed train that derailed, causing last Sunday's rail disaster in which 45 people died, an initial report has found.A train run by private company Iryo derailed last Sunday and its rear carriages crossed on to the opposite track into the path of an oncoming train run by state-owned Renfe.The CIAF rail investigation commission said not only did Iryo train's front carriages which stayed on the track have \"notches\" in their wheels, but three earlier trains that went over the track earlier did too.A gap of almost 40cm (15in) in the track has become the focus of the investigation into the crash.Sunday's deadly collision occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the Iryo train left Málaga for Madrid.The train's last three carriages - carriages six to eight - derailed and collided with the Huelva-bound Renfe train. \"Carriage six derailed due to a complete lack of continuity in the track,\" the preliminary report finds.Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the state-operated train.Earlier this week, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente confirmed reports that grooves were found on the wheels of the Iryo train's carriages, which had passed over the track safely.\"These notches in the wheels and the deformation observed in the track are compatible with the fact that the track was cracked,\" the CIAF preliminary report said.It added that three trains that had gone over the tracks at 17:21 on Sunday, 19:01 and then 19:09 had similar notches \"with a compatible geometric pattern\".Similar grooves are found on carriages two, three and four of the Iryo train, the report says, but carriage five  - the last that did not derail -  had a groove on its outer edge, suggesting the rail was already tilting outwards before carriage six derailed.The CIAF called its report a \"working hypothesis\", adding that it \"must be corroborated by later detailed calculations and analysis\".The transport minister appeared before reporters again on Friday to say that it was too early to have definitive answers, but that if the cause of the crash was the fracture, then it occurred in the minutes and hours before the derailment and could not have been detected.The Adamuz disaster is is the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade. In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.",

    "body": "'I saw people getting shot': Eyewitness tells of Iran protest crackdown13 hours agoSoroush PakzadParniaParnia was visiting family in Isfahan when the protests beganWarning: This story contains details which some readers might find distressing.An Iranian woman who witnessed the bloody crackdown on protests in Iran has described how her neighbourhood turned into a \"war zone\" as security forces opened fire at crowds with live ammunition.A government-imposed internet blackout in Iran, now in its third week, has prevented many accounts of what has happened from reaching the wider world.But some Iranians who have left the country have been able to share what they have seen.Parnia, who lives in London, told the BBC that she was visiting her family in the central city of Isfahan when the protests broke out in the capital, Tehran. They quickly spread across the country, and within days there were hundreds of protesters in the Hakim Nezami and Khaghani neighbourhoods of Isfahan.\"There were women and men from seven to 70 years old,\" she said. \"On just one street there were 200 to 300 people. People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'.\" The \"dictator\" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency.First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot.\"I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street.\"Parnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman. Inside, she said, were many injured protesters.\"I saw the lobby floor covered in blood, and I saw a girl whose leg was full of pellets.\"Videos verified by the BBC from that night show large numbers of people in the streets in Isfahan. Some streets were blocked by traffic sign poles and large metal sheets, in an apparent effort by protesters to protect themselves from gunfire.Footage also showed protesters breaking through the gates of the building of the national broadcaster Irib, which was later set on fire.Phone footageThe building of the state broadcaster in Isfahan was set on fireOn Friday morning, 9 January, Khamenei said Iran would not back down from dealing with what he called \"destructive elements\", a day after US President Donald Trump had threatened to hit Iran \"very hard\" if authorities started killing people.Following Khamenei's speech, the powerful Revolutionary Guards sent a text message to people across Iran, telling them to avoid gatherings on streets in areas of unrest. The messages also warned against co-operating with what it described as \"terrorist mercenaries\" - an act it said would constitute treason.Despite the risks, Parnia went out to protest again on Friday evening.\"The protesters were hopeful,\" she said. \"You could see fear on everyone's faces. We were afraid to pass in front of the security forces and come closer together,\" she said.\"We thought even if we get killed, it would be a reason for Trump to act faster.\"Footage obtained by the BBC from the previous day shows large crowds on main streets in Parnia's neighbourhood. But she said on the Friday it was different.Phone footageHundreds of people gathered on the streets of Isfahan to protest\"Protesters were in small groups gathered in alleyways. Every time that someone tried to gather in the larger street, we could hear live fire sound followed by screams and shouts.\"Because of the internet blackouts, and protesters avoiding taking their phones with them, the BBC has not yet obtained footage from Friday night.Parnia also described a scene of \"total chaos\" at a local clinic that was treating wounded protesters.\"No phone lines were working. Nobody could call their families, and many refused to go to hospitals, fearing they could be arrested there,\" she said. \"All the nurses could do was clean the wounds and send them home. The next day you could still smell the tear gasses in the air. Security forces were present and there were checkpoints across the city.\"Parnia left Isfahan that same day and travelled to the capital, Tehran, to catch a flight back to London.\"I arrived in Tehran at 6pm. All the shops were closed and many people gathered in the streets. At 8pm everyone started to chant and I could hear gunshots,\" she said.\"The airport was so busy. Many foreign airlines were cancelled and people were frustrated. Luckily, I found an Iranian flight to leave.\"Since her return to the UK, Parnia has been in touch with her friends in Isfahan.She said she learned from a source that doctors at Feiz eye hospital in Isfahan had carried out around 300 surgical procedures to remove the eyes of patients with birdshot-related facial injuries.\"Every time you go out into the streets, you see random people with eye patches,\" Parnia's friends told her.According to several health workers who spoke to the BBC, hospitals are monitored and controlled by security forces, and people with gunshot wounds in Isfahan are being arrested.\"Many of the injured are developing infections. Some doctors are referring them to surgeons who can treat them in private clinics,\" Parnia's cited her friends as saying.While Iranian authorities have said around 3,000 people were killed during the protests, US-based human rights group HRANA has so far confirmed more than 4,600 deaths, with another 9,700 cases still under review. According to the group, at least 7,300 people have also sustained serious injuries. Many believe the true figures may be even higher.Parnia said she was now preparing to join Iranian opposition protests in the UK, saying she wants to be a voice for the silenced protesters.She also expressed anger at international media reports suggesting that Iranians and the country's political opposition was not united.\"Iranians have shown what they want in the streets and paid a high price for it.\"",

    "body": "A Canadian backpacker, who was found dead on an Australian beach and surrounded by a pack of dingoes earlier this week, likely died of drowning, an autopsy has found. Piper James, 19, had \"physical evidence consistent with drowning\" and \"injuries consistent with dingo bites\", a spokesperson for the Coroners Court of Queensland told BBC news.\"Pre-mortem dingo bite marks\" were unlikely to have caused her \"immediate death\", the spokesperson added. The autopsy was part of a preliminary assessment, and establishing her exact cause of death could take several weeks.Piper's body was found on a beach on K'Gari, an island off the eastern state of Queensland on Monday.In a statement to the BBC, the coroner also said there were \"extensive post-mortem dingo bite marks\" and that no evidence anyone else was involved.Piper's father, Todd James told Australia's 9News that the family felt relieved, as the autopsy results meant her body could be released back to her family in Canada.Her mother Angela told Global News that her daughter had always dreamed of travelling and had saved money for this trip after she graduated high school.Both parents had concerns about her travelling at her age, but Piper was determined.The teenager had been working at a backpacker's hostel for the past six weeks, and told friends she was going for a 05:00 morning swim on Monday, Australian media reported.Her body was found around 06:30 local time (20:30 GMT on Sunday).She was found near the Maheno shipwreck, which was washed ashore in 1935 and is now a popular tourist landmark.The area is known for its population of dingoes, a wild species of native dog that is protected in Queensland national parks.About 200 dingoes live on World Heritage-listed K'Gari, according to the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.",

    "body": "16 hours agoHafizullah Maroof,BBC AfghanandFlora DruryA 22-year-old Afghan woman who was reportedly running a taekwondo gym for girls has been released after spending 13 days in jail, a spokesman for the Taliban's supreme court confirmed.Khadija Ahmadzada was detained for being in \"violation\" of rules \"regarding women's sports gyms\", a spokesman for the Taliban's ministry of vice and virtue told the BBC.Sports clubs have been closed to women since 2021, shortly after the Taliban returned to power.At the time, it was said they would reopen once a \"safe environment\" - which does not contravene the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic law - had been established.As of January 2026, no sports club has reopened, while women are still unable to compete.It is one of a raft of measures that have been imposed on women by the Taliban since 2021, which have seen their rights to education and work curtailed as well as strict rules around clothing imposed.Ahmadzada, who lives near the western city of Herat, was detained with a number of other people after \"violations were observed\" by vice and virtue inspectors, the ministry spokesman said. She was accused of not wearing \"a proper hijab\", \"playing music\" and allowing genders to mix in her gym and sentenced to 13 days in jail. The spokesman said she had been given multiple warnings.The case was then referred to the supreme court, which announced she would be released on Thursday 22 January. It is unclear where she is now.News of Ahmadzada's arrest led to an outcry on social media, attracting the attention of Richard Bennett, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, who posted online calling for her immediate release.He also highlighted the case of female journalist Nazira Rashidi, in the northern city of Kunduz, who was detained in late December. Taliban spokesmen deny her detention is related to her work as a journalist, according to local media.",

    "body": "18 hours agoCaroline DaviesPakistan correspondentThe death toll in a fire which engulfed a shopping centre in Pakistan has climbed to 67, police have confirmed.Police say 77 people are currently reported as missing by their families following the fire at Gul Plaza, in Pakistan's largest city Karachi, on Saturday evening.But the scale of the damage following the blaze - which took more than 24 hours to put out - has slowed rescue efforts, as authorities comb the remains of the 6,500sq m (70,000 sq ft) complex.While some of the bodies found are only partial remains, authorities had been able to count 67 skulls, the deputy commissioner of police told the BBC. The process to identify the bodies continues, with 15 people identified so far.Gul Plaza had housed some 1,200 shops, spread across multiple floors. It is wedding season in Karachi, often a particularly busy time of year for shoppers.While the cause of the fire is still unknown, witnesses earlier told the BBC that a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster.Shop owner Rehan Faisal recounted how it only took about \"five to seven minutes\" for everything to \"burn before our eyes\".\"Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs. I was just beginning to comprehend the situation when the shop owner told me to lock up and get out,\" he told BBC Urdu.With the facility due to close soon, most of the gates of the shopping centre were locked, witnesses said.Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked.",

While the watchmaker has not disclosed the price, industry collective Watchopea estimates its value at $1.5m (£1.1m, 137m rupees).The centre - branded as a private wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre - is home to more than 2,000 species, including lions, elephants and tigers, and is spread over 3,500 acres. The zoo, which is owned by Anant and is not open to the public, hit the headlines last year after allegations of unlawfully acquiring and mistreating animals, but a Supreme Court-appointed team later found no evidence of wrongdoing.Getty ImagesAnant Ambani and wife Radhika Merchant's one pre-wedding bash was held at VantaraIt is located in Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, not far from Mukesh Ambani's oil refinery - which is the largest in the world.Vantara was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March last year.It was also one of the venues for Anant Ambani's lavish 2024 pre-wedding events that made global headlines.The wedding and other events were attended by all of India's top Bollywood stars and global celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Rihanna.

It said the watch was made up of 397 precious stones, including diamonds, green sapphires, garnets and other gems.An executive associated with the brand's India retail partner Ethos Watches told the BBC that the company has not disclosed the price of the watch.

    "body": "9 hours agoFrank GardnerBBC Security CorrespondentPA MediaBlast walls, rocket attacks, Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)... and long queues in the canteen. Anyone who deployed to Afghanistan, in whatever role, between 2001-2021 will have their own vivid memories of that time. It started with the flight in – to Kandahar, Kabul or Camp Bastion. It could be a long, slow descent with the lights out on an RAF jet, or a rapid, corkscrew down in a C-130 transport plane. In both cases the aim was to avoid being blown out of the air by a Taliban surface-to-air missile.Over the course of 20 years thousands of servicemen and women, as well as civilians, from dozens of countries deployed to Afghanistan, answering the US call for assistance. That call came in the form of invoking Nato's Article 5 of its charter – the only time it has ever happened in Nato's 77-year history – which states that an attack on one member shall be deemed an attack on all.America was reeling from the devastating 9/11 attacks when al-Qaeda, which was being sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan, murdered nearly 3,000 people by flying packed airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington.The Taliban were swiftly driven from power in a joint effort by the US military, the CIA and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. Then it was all about trying to hunt down the remnants of al-Qaeda as Britain's Royal Marines, together with UK Special Forces, pursued them over the mountains but many escaped to safety to regroup in Pakistan. It was not until ten years later that the US Navy's Seal Team Six commandos tracked down the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan.The first two years of the US-led \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" as it was called, were relatively quiet. By late 2003, as America's attention switched to Iraq, US servicemen we met even started referring to Afghanistan as \"Op Forgotten\". But it was still dangerous. From a rain-soaked Kandahar airbase we watched Romanian troops edge nervously out on patrol in their Soviet-era armoured vehicles, wary of the next ambush. Flying into a remote US-manned firebase in the mountainous Paktika province in a Blackhawk helicopter, my BBC crew and I were told cheerfully: \"You've come to the worst place in the world\". Sure enough, the Taliban launched Chinese-made rockets at the base after dark, planted there, we were told, by farmers who had been either bribed or coerced into doing so.Everything changed after 2006, when the UK deployed in force to Helmand province, a part of Afghanistan that had been relatively peaceful until then. The Taliban made their intentions clear. If you come, they said, then we will fight you. And yet the UK government at the time appeared shocked at the ferocity of the fighting 3 Para now found themselves engaged in, with British paratroopers calling in mortar and artillery fire so close to their positions it was termed \"danger close\", in an effort to stop their bases from being overrun.Over the next eight years, until the end of combat operations in 2014, it was not just Americans who were risking life and limb to serve in Afghanistan. Brits, Canadians, Danes and Estonians were among those who saw the toughest fighting in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. It would also be churlish to ignore the bravery and sacrifice of so many Afghans who fought and died over two decades.I say \"fighting\" but most soldiers' biggest fears stemmed from the hidden IEDs, those expertly concealed Improvised Explosive Devices. The Taliban, who of course knew every inch of their terrain, were often able to guess correctly exactly where troops would need to cross an irrigation ditch or canal and so place the bomb accordingly. In the space of a split second, in a blinding flash and puff of black smoke, a fit, healthy, 20-something individual would have their life either ended or catastrophically changed, facing amputation and a host of other complications. So prevalent were these IEDs that soldiers were going out of the gates of their FOBs - Forward Operating Bases - on patrol praying that if they got hit it would result in a below-the-knee amputation, not one above the knee.The courage and resilience of the people I have met since, who have managed, despite terrible loss and adversity, to turn their shattered lives around, is both humbling and awe-inspiring. These are just some of the people who answered America's call for help after the 9/11 attacks. It is little wonder there has been such nationwide outrage at that country's president's suggestion that they somehow dodged the fighting.",

    "body": "11 hours agoAbdirahman Ali Dhimbil,BBC SomaliandJean OtalorThe president of Somaliland has held separate talks with his Israeli counterpart and the second son of the US leader, as the breakaway region continues to seek international recognition and foreign investment.Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi met Isaac Herzog and businessman Eric Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.''Our discussions focused on strengthening and advancing bilateral relations between the Republic of Somaliland and the State of Israel,'' Abdullahi said in a post on X about the meeting with Herzog.Last month, Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland - 35 years after it declared independence from Somalia.President \"Cirro\", as he is known in Somaliland, shared images on social media of the closed-door event, which was reportedly organised by the Greek House Davos programme, a private forum for discreet high-level gatherings. Abdirahman Bayle, an advisor to Somaliland's leader, told the BBC that Eric Trump had ''expressed interest in Somaliland and the opportunities it offers''.''Among the issues we discussed were global investors in the livestock and agriculture sectors, so that we can industrialise these sectors and export to the rest of the world,\" Bayle added.Livestock is the territory's main export, primarily to Saudi Arabia.Eric Trump does not have any official US government position but holds a senior role at the Trump Organization, which runs the family's businesses. The BBC has approached his representatives for comment but has not received a response.Somaliland sits in a strategic position on major Red Sea and Gulf of Aden shipping routes. During the talks, the president emphasised Somaliland's openness to investment, pointing to the deep-water port of Berbera as a potential logistics hub for trade and energy infrastructure.Bayle told the BBC that his government's approach had shifted.\"For the first time, we are not asking the world for aid,\" he said. \"We are offering our resources.\"Israel's president described the talks as positive, posting on X: \"I was pleased to meet here in Davos with the President of Somaliland. \"I welcome the establishment of diplomatic relations between us and look forward to deepening cooperation for the benefit of our two peoples.\"Earlier this month, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland for the first time and said Israel was determined to advance relations with Somaliland \"with momentum\".Somaliland has governed itself since it broke away from Somalia in 1991 after the collapse of the central government in Mogadishu. It has held its own elections, issued its own currency and built its own security forces, maintaining relative stability compared with much of southern Somalia.However, its declaration of independence had not been recognised internationally until Israel's move in December. The recognition drew criticism from Somalia, the African Union and countries including China and Turkey, which said it violated Somalia's territorial integrity.The US defended Israel, accusing its critics of double standards.",

    "body": "Alleged drug kingpin and ex-Olympian Ryan Wedding arrested after years on the run6 hours agoAna FaguyandMax MatzaWatch: Ryan Wedding escorted by police in handcuffs after arrestFormer Canadian Olympic snowboarder and alleged drug kingpin Ryan Wedding has been arrested in Mexico and will be extradited to the US after years on the run, FBI Director Kash Patel has said.Wedding, who had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, is accused of running a transnational drug trafficking operation that moved tonnes of cocaine across international borders.Wedding, 44, was also wanted on murder charges. US officials had said they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.The head of Canada's federal police force, which assisted in the investigation, spoke alongside Patel on Friday to praise the law enforcement operation.\"No single agency or nation can combat transnational organised crime alone,\" said Mike Duheme, Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). \"We can finally say that our communities, our countries, are much safer with the arrest of Ryan Wedding,\" he added.Wedding is expected to make his first court appearance in Los Angeles on Monday.FBIWedding, seen in an undated photo released by the FBIWedding is accused of running a vast drug trafficking operation responsible for importing some 60 metric tonnes of cocaine a year.The organisation operated across North America, as well as several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and was also the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, bringing in an estimated $1bn a year. Before he was arrested, Wedding was accused of killing a federal witness in a case against him. Officials say he has also ordered the murders of several others.Wedding is now facing a slew of felony charges, including witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking.The FBI had previously placed a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest. Patel declined to comment on whether anyone would be claiming the reward money.US officials have released limited details regarding how Wedding was captured, except to say that his arrest took place on Thursday night in Mexico City. Mexico's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, said in a post on X that Patel had visited Mexico City on Thursday, and departed with two fugitives on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. He did not name the men arrested, but said one was a \"Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered\" at the US embassy in Mexico. Watch: FBI director calls Ryan Wedding \"a modern day Pablo Escobar\"The Associated Press, citing an unnamed Mexican Security Cabinet member,  reported that Wedding is the Canadian who turned himself in at the US embassy. In his remarks at a news conference, Patel described Wedding as a \"modern-day Pablo Escobar\", referring to the Colombian cartel leader. US officials have also compared him to Mexican drug dealer Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán.\"When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front,\" Patel said, thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation.Patel also thanked the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, who participated in taking Wedding into custody.In an interview with Vanity Fair, Patel praised the team, which had also been involved in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro weeks earlier.\"This was a complex, high-stakes operation with zero margin for error,\" Patel told the magazine. \"I was on the ground with our team in Mexico and witnessed extraordinary teamwork, precision, and trust between our agents and partners in Mexico.\"Wedding's aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI said. He has reportedly had plastic surgery to change his appearance while on the run.Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.Authorities allege he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.Getty ImagesThe FBI had offered a $15m reward for Ryan WeddingOfficials say he had been living in luxury in Mexico. In December, Mexican authorities announced that they had seized $40m in racing motorcycles owned by Wedding. They also seized other valuable items, including luxury paintings, artworks, drugs and two Olympic gold medals.It is unclear to whom the medals belong. Wedding competed for Canada in the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, but did not win any medals. He came in 24th place in the men's giant parallel slalom ski event.In November, the FBI seized his rare 2002 Mercedes CLK-GTR, which had been valued at $13m.Patel also spoke about the recent arrest of another man in Mexico who had been on the FBI's most wanted list. American man Alejandro Castillo was wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend. According to the FBI, he has been in hiding in Mexico for nearly 10 years, and will now be extradited back to North Carolina for trial. ",

    "body": "Mandela's prison key, sunglasses and shirt can be sold after daughter wins court battleA South African court has dismissed an appeal by the country's heritage body to stop the sale and export of various artefacts connected to anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela.The 70 personal items include a cell key from Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 of the 27 years he was locked up, a pair of Aviator sunglasses and one of his signature floral shirts. They were due to be exported to the US for auction.The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration. In trying to stop their sale, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export.The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m).The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa.Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former president's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province.In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argued that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad.The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were.It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment.Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming \"to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family\".\"Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name,\" she said.She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction.Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations.Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects.Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He led the African National Congress in its struggle against apartheid - a system of legally enforced racism - and was released from prison in 1990.He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with then-President FW de Klerk.Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994.",

    "body": "20 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business Correspondent, SingaporeGetty ImagesOne in seven people in the world use TikTok. Yet for the company behind such a cultural phenomenon, the last few years have been a rollercoaster.Concerns over the app first surfaced more than five years ago, prompting President Trump, in his first term, to sign an executive order aimed at removing TikTok from US stores.Lawmakers were worried that the Chinese government could access user data of the 200 million Americans who use the app and possibly manipulate their feeds.To address these concerns, TikTok's parent company ByteDance launched Project Texas – storing US user data on domestic servers run by American-owned Oracle. The company also moved its headquarters to Singapore and Los Angeles – in part to distance itself from its Chinese roots.These were seen as significant concessions at the time. But still, in 2024 Congress passed a law threatening to ban the app outright, unless ByteDance transferred majority ownership and changed how TikTok operates in the US.That deal has now closed with ByteDance signing an agreement to split the US app from the rest of its global business under a new consortium of companies that includes Oracle.TikTok remains alive in a critical market, but the terms underline the compromises and limits that ByteDance - and perhaps other Chinese tech firms - may face as they try to expand globally.How did we get here?The US-China rivalry has seen Washington and Beijing crack down on each other's firms over national security concerns.Yet in the the most recent trade war TikTok became \"low hanging fruit\" that China could offer in exchange for other important concessions, like American agricultural products.The deal allows China to frame the outcome as a win - exporting tech on its own terms while gaining leverage in broader trade negotiations.ByteDance will retain access to America's 200 million users and 7.5 million businesses, but it loses control over TikTok's algorithm and data.Instead, the company will licence the algorithm to the new US entity, in a deal the Trump administration has valued at $14bn (£10bn).\"TikTok's power lies in its content graph - an algorithm that learns from thousands of user signals to deliver hyper‑relevant, highly addictive videos,\" said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester.\"With a US joint venture retraining that algorithm on domestic data, the experience will change... One thing's certain: TikTok in America won't be the same.\"This shift could have knock on effects for advertisers and creators because of the changes. Creators may see their engagement shrink especially because global virality will take a hit – previously content that took off in one region could become popular in the US organically. A US-only algorithm could weaken that, forcing brands to re-structure deals and perhaps having to pay more for US exposure.TikTok's global revenue was estimated to be $20-26bn in 2024, roughly $10 billion of which came from the US with advertising accounting for a large share.The changes will likely hurt TikTok's bottom line in the US, but ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake and therefore a share of the profits.The retraining of the algorithm might also have consequences for ByteDance's technology development.Running separate US and global algorithms, split workforces, and parallel governance adds engineering costs, slows innovation, and adds to the operational complexity, says Charlie Dai Principal Analyst in Technology Architecture & Delivery at Forrester.The India experienceByteDance has faced political and regulatory hurdles before.The loss of India in 2020 - then TikTok's largest market, with 200 million users - was a far bigger setback than any potential disruption in the US, says Chris Stokel-Walker, author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World's Favourite App.But, he says, even the India \"setback\" wasn't much of a setback. \"They've continued to show growth despite these challenges.\"The struggles in both the US and India share a common thread: they were triggered by geopolitical tensions.The India ban, however, was not aimed at TikTok alone - it targeted China more broadly, with roughly 200 apps blocked across the country. And while that ban opened the door for homegrown platforms to emerge, none have come close to matching TikTok's success.Getty ImagesTikTok CEO Shou Chew will be a director in the new US ventureFor some, the TikTok deal inevitably invites comparisons with Huawei – another Chinese tech champion whose global ambitions have been reshaped by geopolitics.But there are stark differences, Huawei has been effectively locked out of Western markets after US sanctions cut off access to critical 5G infrastructure.TikTok by contrast has been allowed to remain, albeit on restrictive terms for ByteDance.Chris Stokel-Walker says this reflects a shift in how governments are responding to Chinese technology companies.Some are excluded altogether; others are permitted to operate, but only within tightly defined political and regulatory limits.A homegrown championWhile TikTok is being reshaped abroad, it has full control over Douyin – its Chinese sister app – which is hugely successful in its own right within China.Douyin forms a core pillar of ByteDance's business – it is profitable, politically aligned and able to innovate because it is in charge of training the algorithm on data it has full access to.But ByteDance is also hedging its bets for the future, investing in data centres, the cloud and Artificial Intelligence, underscoring the company's efforts to diversify beyond advertising-led consumer apps.Chris Stokel-Walker argues that TikTok's predicament is no longer really about data security, but about who controls speech, culture and influence in the US.Trump has never liked that China might be shaping American culture, he says.The reality is that ByteDance will continue to operate TikTok in the US, but with distinct limitations. And this could spill over into other markets it plans to expand in with regulators looking for more control over Chinese technology.Other experts have said the licensing aspect of the deal could form a template for how other Chinese tech companies expand globally in an environment of increasing mistrust of Beijing.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent , KyivReutersThis was the first time the three delegations have met in the same room together.Negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the US have been meeting in Abu Dhabi for their first trilateral talks since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.But whilst the talks take a new format, the core differences remain the same.The stakes are high, but expectations are limited.Donald Trump is pushing hard for a peace deal in Ukraine – the one he promised but hasn't yet delivered – and he said this week that the two sides would be \"stupid\" if they couldn't agree.But despite some intense shuttle diplomacy by his own envoys, they are hosting the first trilateral talks involving Ukrainian and Russian negotiators with some major issues still unresolved.Ukraine is engaging with the process because it wants peace more than anyone, but also because it needs to keep the US onside. It learned that lesson the hard way last year, when Donald Trump briefly suspended intelligence sharing and military aid.Getty ImagesUkraine wants peace more than anyone in this processNow, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his talks with Trump in Davos were \"really positive\" and he hopes for more air defence support against Russia's relentless attacks as a result.Often grim-faced after his encounters with the US leader, this time Zelensky seemed unusually upbeat.But he remains cautious on the outcome of talks in the United Arab Emirates.He's described the meetings, which may last two days, as \"a step\", but shied away from calling it a positive one.\"We have to wish it will push us a bit closer to peace,\" is how he put it.For a while, Zelensky has talked about being 90% of the way to producing a framework deal for peace, but the final 10% was always going to be the hardest - and Russia could still reject the whole thing.\"It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land. This is the issue that's not resolved yet,\" he explained, spelling out the biggest obstacle that he says still remains.Russia insists that Ukraine should hand over the big slice of the eastern Donbas region, which it has failed to win on the battlefield. Ukraine refuses.Politicians often talk about their red lines, but for this country the line in the Donbas is drawn with the blood of the soldiers who died defending it.Zelensky can't cross it.As I write this, the music from another soldier's funeral is drifting up from a church in the street.On my way back into Ukraine this time, we drove past so many military graves in roadside cemeteries, all marked with flags.The other big issue up for discussion in the UAE is what the US would do, militarily, if Russia were to invade Ukraine again someday. That's what Ukraine calls its \"security guarantees\", and says are essential.Zelensky says the deal between the US and Ukraine is done, but we have no real details.Russia's response also remains a wide-open question.There's also the giant new doubt about how good a guarantee from Donald Trump really is: the US president's fixation on \"acquiring\" Greenland has severely undermined Nato.He's also undermined the very principle of protecting a nation's sovereignty, the whole basis for Western support for Ukraine.So can Kyiv trust him to come to the rescue in the next crisis? For now, it doesn't have much choice.As for trusting Vladimir Putin, no one here is under any illusions that his aims have changed.\"He really doesn't want it,\" is what Zelensky said in Davos about Putin and peace.The Kremlin has said that if it doesn't get what it wants at the talking table, it will \"achieve its aims on the battlefield\" - though it's failed so far, despite sacrificing a huge number of soldiers.So once again, it's targeting civilian infrastructure across the country - but in a more deliberate, sustained, and devastating way than ever before.In the depths of a bitter winter, that's left people freezing in their homes.Today, the mayor of Kyiv again called on city residents to leave if they have somewhere to go.\"The enemy will most likely continue to attack the critical infrastructure of the city and the country,\" Vitali Klitschko warned.After repeat attacks, the system is very fragile.\"I address the residents and say honestly: the situation is extremely difficult and this may not be the most difficult moment yet.\"",

    "body": "Danish PM in Greenland for 'show of support' after Trump threats37 minutes agoAdrienne MurrayCopenhagenReutersFrederiksen (left) said there was now a \"diplomatic, political track\" to pursue after a difficult weekDanish PM Mette Frederiksen is visiting Greenland's capital Nuuk for talks with the territory's leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, after a rollercoaster week that saw US President Donald Trump roll back his threats to forcibly take over the Arctic island and agree to further negotiations.Tensions had risen precariously over the past couple of weeks, until a stunning turnaround on Wednesday, when Trump suddenly ruled out military action, and withdrew his threats to slap tariffs on several European allies.Trump posted on social media that a \"framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland\" had been reached, following his meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos.However, few details have been given, and there are questions about what exactly was agreed between the US president and the secretary general.The Danish prime minister travelled directly from Brussels, where she also met face-to-face with Rutte earlier on Friday morning. According to Rutte's post on X, they agreed \"to enhance deterrence and defence in the Arctic\".After landing at Nuuk airport, Frederiksen was greeted on the tarmac by Nielsen, who gave her a hug.\"I am first and foremost in Greenland today to show our strong Danish support for the Greenlandic people,\" she told reporters. \"It's a very difficult time, everyone can see that.\"\"It is a serious situation we are in. Everyone can see that. Now there is a diplomatic, political track that we will pursue,\" she said. Her trip was a \"working\" visit to prepare their \"next steps,\" she said.On Thursday, Trump told Fox News that the US \"gets everything we want at no cost\" and that a \"piece\" of his planned \"Golden Dome\" missile defence system would be placed on Greenland.When asked if this was an actual \"acquisition\", he answered: \"It's total access. There's no end, there's no time limit.\" Notably, Trump did not mention American ownership of Greenland.For former Danish foreign minister, Martin Lidegaard, that's a sign of positivity. \"I hear a change in the language from the President,\" he said. \"He does not necessarily think he has to own [Greenland].\"\"I'm a bit more optimistic than I have been for quite a long time, where we saw only escalation after escalation after escalation,\" says Lidegaard, who's also known for inspiring the latest series of Borgen, a Danish political drama, which features a plotline about a power struggle over Greenland.But despite Trump's climbdown, Greenlandic MP Aaja Chemnitz told the BBC it will take much more to rebuild the trust of her compatriots. \"I think it's too early to lower our shoulder… Many people are confused and concerned.\"Earlier Trump had also told CNBC that an \"ultimate long-term deal\" over Greenland \"pertains to security and minerals, and everything else\".Chemnitz is sceptical. \"Minerals haven't been discussed with Nato. Why should they do that? This is completely up to Greenland,\" she said, which has legal authority over its own land and resources.Likewise, Per Stig Moeller, another former Danish Foreign Minister, remains cautious.He said the situation is \"still very delicate\" and \"might change tomorrow\", pointing to recent meetings in Washington, and the White House's diverging interpretation of what had been agreed.\"That's why it's very important that we insist, it all happens inside NATO,\" he suggests.Previously the New York Times reported that one idea under discussion was Denmark ceding sovereignty over small pockets of land where the US would build military bases.However Danish and Greenlandic officials have pushed back strongly against giving up any sovereignty, making clear that it is a \"red line\".Frederiksen has said it was non-negotiable, although Denmark was willing to work on \"security\".Trump has argued that taking control over Greenland is necessary for the security of the United States, pointing to a growing presence of China and Russia in the Arctic.In response Denmark and its European allies have sought to reassure the US that they'll boost Arctic security, while calling for a more substantive Nato presence.Ahead of an emergency European summit in the Belgian capital on Thursday evening, Frederiksen said that Greenland's sovereignty was non-negotiable, though Denmark was willing to work on \"security\".ReutersFrederiksen (centre-left in light-brown) has described Greenland's sovereignty as a \"red line\"The US has around 150 military personnel at its single Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory.Under a defence pact with Denmark, dating back to 1951, the US can already build up its military presence and deploy further troops.\"They withdrew bases. They withdrew soldiers,\" says Per Stig Moeller. \"Did we throw them out? No, we did not. They went themselves.\"That was updated in 2004, jointly with the Bush administration, to include Greenland as an equal partner to the deal.\"We signed it together,\" says Moeller, who was Denmark's foreign secretary at the time. \"It's the real working treaty today.\"\"[The US] can make important changes to their military, to bases in Greenland. They just have to inform us or confer with us,\" he adds.AFP has reported that sources familiar with talks had said the US and Denmark would renegotiate the 1951 agreement.Danish national newspaper Berlingske also writes that a renegotiation is possible, that the Danish and Greenlandic sides have not ruled out revising that deal. However, mineral rights or the surrender of territory have never been on the table.The BBC has reached out to Denmark's Ministry of Defence, which declined to comment.Whatever is negotiated, Aaja Chemnitz says it could be an uphill battle for the United States to win Greenlandic hearts and minds.\"When Trump's talking about a 'big chunk of ice' that he wants,\" she says, referring to the US president's speech in Davos, \"this is very, very disrespectful towards the people of Greenland\".\"I think it will be much more difficult for the US to make an agreement,\" she adds. \"The people of Greenland are really pushing away from the US, after everything that has happened this last year.\"Meanwhile Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Friday there had been no detailed plan, but that negotiations would start soon, focusing on \"security, security, and security\".",

    "body": "23 hours agoJude Sheerin,WashingtonandHelen SullivanReutersUS President Donald Trump has withdrawn an invitation for Canada to join his newly constituted Board of Peace, in the latest spat between the North American neighbours.\"Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining,\" Trump said on Truth Social in a post addressed to Prime Minister Mark Carney, who made headlines this week when he warned of a \"rupture\" in the US-led global order. Canada had indicated that while it would not pay to be on the board, it would join. Meanwhile, EU chief Antonio Costa said European leaders have serious doubts about the scope of the board, but were willing to work with the body in Gaza.The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.Trump did not give a reason in Thursday evening's post as to why he had decided to revoke Canada's offer. Carney's office did not immediately respond. The prime minster had indicated last week he would accept Trump's offer on principle.But Ottawa had indicated in recent days that it would not pay the $1bn (£740m) membership fee which Trump has said permanent members will be asked to pay to help fund the board.Trump's Board of Peace was originally thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. BBC looks into who is and isn't on Trump's Board of PeaceBut its proposed charter does not mention the Palestinian territory and appears to be designed to supplant functions of the UN. Trump would be chairman for life.Some 60 nations have been invited to join the board and about 35 have already signed up, according to the White House.Those who have agreed to join so far include Argentina, Belarus, Morocco, Vietnam, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kosovo, Hungary, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Jordan, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.But none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.The UK has expressed concerns about the inclusion of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces are fighting in Ukraine after invading in 2022. France said the charter as it currently stood was \"incompatible\" with its international commitments, especially its UN membership.European Council president Antonio Costa said European leaders have doubts about the scope of the board, but were ready to work with the US and the newly founded body in Gaza.Speaking on Friday after an EU leaders' summit in Brussels, Costa said, \"We have serious doubts about a number of elements in the charter of the Board of Peace related to its scope, its governance and its compatibility with the UN Charter.\"But he said the EU was \"ready to work together with the US on the implementation of the comprehensive Peace Plan for Gaza, with a Board of Peace carrying out its mission as a transitional administration\".After the EU leaders' summit, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters that his country had \"declined\" the invitation to participate in the body.Watch: Board of Peace, Zelensky and Musk - What happened before Trump left Davos?Trump's withdrawal of Canada's invitation came after Carney appeared to irk Trump with a speech that won a rare standing ovation this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos.The prime minister urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", although he did not mention the US president by name.A day later Trump told the gathering in the Swiss Alpine resort that Canada gets many \"freebies\" from the US and it \"should be grateful\".\"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said. \"Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"On Thursday, Carney swiped back at Trump as he delivered another speech back on home turf.Speaking in Quebec, he said: \"Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadians.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Can you ban kids from social media? Australia is about to, but some teens are a step ahead13 hours agoTiffanie TurnbullSydneyBBC/Jessica HromasIsobel is convinced the social media ban won't stop kids like herIt took 13-year-old Isobel less than five minutes to outsmart Australia's \"world-leading\" social media ban for children.A notification from Snapchat, one of the ten platforms affected, had lit up her screen, warning she'd be booted off when the law kicked in this week – if she couldn't prove she was over 16.\"I got a photo of my mum, and I stuck it in front of the camera and it just let me through. It said thanks for verifying your age,\" Isobel claims. \"I've heard someone used Beyoncé's face,\" she adds.\"I texted her,\" she gestures to her mum Mel, \"and I was like, 'Hey Mummy, I got past the social media ban' and she was just like, 'Oh, you monkey'.\"It made her laugh, Mel explains: \"This is exactly what I thought was going to happen.\"Though she had let Isobel use TikTok and Snapchat with tight supervision – preferring that to the teenager using it covertly – she had been hoping the ban, as promised, would help parents like her protect their children from the dangers of the online world.That hope has now wavered, as a series of experts – and kids themselves – sound the alarm on the viability and safety of the landmark policy, which is being closely watched around the globe and eyed with trepidation by some of its most influential companies.There's concern about the reliability of the technology enforcing the ban, along with fears it could isolate vulnerable children and push others into darker, less-regulated corners of the web.The question nervously being asked in the halls of Canberra, in households across the nation, and in tech boardrooms around the world: is this actually going to work?'Parents are worried sick about the safety of kids online'You'd struggle to find anyone in Australia who feels social media companies are doing enough to shield users – particularly children – from harm on their platforms. Their protestations to the contrary fall on unsympathetic ears.\"We have zero faith the tech companies will do anything other than protect their profits,\" Dany Elachi, a father of five and anti-smartphone campaigner, tells the BBC.\"They've had ample opportunity to show they take children's wellbeing seriously and they've failed at every turn.\"Detailing how bullying – inescapable due to social media – had culminated in her 15-year-old daughter's suicide, Emma Mason asked world leaders at the UN last month: \"How many more Tillys must die?\"The pair were among the parents and public figures who lent their voices to a headline-grabbing national campaign calling for a new minimum age for social media.Some experts, including Australia's online safety tsar, warned banning children from social media was not the solution, but their concerns were swept away by a tide of parental passion and political pressure.EPAAlbanese has charged Communications Minister Anika Wells with the rolloutIn November 2024, the prime minister announced the legislation, promising parents and children wouldn't be penalised. It'd be up to the platforms to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure account-holders were at least 16 years old, or face fines of up to $49.5m (US$33m, £25m) for the most serious breaches.\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\" Anthony Albanese said.The policy – limited versions of which have been attempted with little success by other jurisdictions around the world – would help free children from addictive algorithms exposing them to harmful content like violence, pornography and misinformation, proponents said. It would also reduce cyber-bullying and online child exploitation. It would force kids outside, help them sleep better, improve their physical and mental health, it was suggested.Noticeably absent from Albanese's announcement was a plan on exactly how the government was going to do this – it gave itself a year to work that out.Within weeks, it had rushed a skeletal bill through parliament, after allowing less than 48 hours for the public to make submissions on the law.How will it be enforced?Watch: Australia's social media ban explained... in 60 secondsA year later, and days out from the official start of the law, questions remain.A government-funded, industry-run trial looked at the main methods of age assurance and earlier this year reported all were technically possible – but none were foolproof and all carried risks.Verification using IDs was the most accurate approach, but that requires users to hand over sensitive and important documents when polling shows most Australians don't trust social media firms.Age inference, which draws conclusions based on users' online activity, and facial assessment technology both lacked the precision to be reliably applied to teenagers.For example, the accuracy of face scans – already rolled out by Meta and Snapchat for suspected underage users – falters for people two to three years either side of 16; the intended target.Still, the report found age assurance technologies can be \"private, robust and effective\", especially when layered.\"When you go to a bottle shop and they look you up and down and go, 'Mmm not really sure', they ask you for some ID… It's the same principle,\" says Tony Allen, who heads the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme and ran the trial.Its findings weren't without controversy. Two former advisory board members levelled accusations of bias and \"privacy-washing\". And though the trial considered ways teenagers might bypass barriers, it was not tasked with testing them.Getty ImagesA facial scan is one of the age check methods offeredTips have flooded social media: everything from signing up with a parent's email and moving to platforms not explicitly named on the government's hit list, to using VPNs, which can disguise a user's location. There was a temporary surge in VPN use in the UK after it introduced tougher age checks for pornography earlier this year, and experts are expecting the same here.Polling conducted for the government in May indicated a third of parents intended to help their kids circumvent the ban, and an experiment by the University of Melbourne showed that a $22 Halloween mask was enough to defeat facial assessment technology in some cases.Proponents of age assurance contend that the technology to thwart circumvention exists. A photo, like Isobel says she used, is not supposed to fool these checks.The BBC asked Snapchat about this, and a spokesperson said the firm had consistently expressed concern about the \"technical challenges\" of enforcing the ban: \"This is one such challenge.\"\"It's a constant running battle to ensure that the mitigations are improving, literally on a daily basis,\" added Luc Delany, an executive for K-ID, which performs age assessments on Snapchat's behalf.BBC/Jessica HromasMel worries the ban has distracted from other meaningful online safety reformsIsobel, buoyed by her experience, says she's pretty sure the ban won't work.\"I'm not a screen addict… but I think Anthony Albanese's idea of us touching grass is stupid,\" she says, referring to the prime minister's comment about getting kids outside.\"If I do end up getting banned, I'll just find another app to use.\"That's up for discussion, Mel clarifies. But she and a host of others fear the platforms and the regulator are set for a relentless game of \"whack-a-mole\" – identifying and shutting down loophole after loophole, and listing emerging platforms only for kids to flock to another.The social media firms also have a motive to subtly undermine the policy, lest other countries follow suit, analysts say, and the vague \"reasonable steps\" outlined by the government leave the door ajar.\"They're going to try to drive a truck through [it],\" says Stephen Scheeler, who led Facebook in Australia and New Zealand between 2013 and 2017.\"It's like getting your kids to do something like load the dishwasher - they'll do it, but they won't do it well, and they won't do it with a smile on their face.\"The fines offer little incentive to behave, he says. Facebook, for example, earns that amount globally in under two hours. \"It's a parking ticket.\"Getty ImagesFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been accused by US Senators of putting profits over safetyThen there's the inevitable legal challenges. Two teenagers have already filed a case in the nation's highest court, alleging the law is unconstitutional and Orwellian. Alphabet, which owns YouTube and Google, is also apparently considering its own challenge. Human rights groups and a smattering of legal experts have raised their hackles too.While the government has insisted the social media companies have the money and the technology to make the ban happen, it has at the same time sought to manage expectations.\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through. Big reforms always do,\" Communications Minister Anika Wells has said.The key question is not can children get around it, Mr Allen says; that answer is yes. But will enough of them be bothered to?\"To be a successful policy, it doesn't have to get to a point where 100% of children aren't on social media,\" he says. \"It only really has to get about 80% of them and the rest will follow.\"Some exasperated parents just want to be able to say it is illegal. They don't want their kids to feel entitled – or pressured – to access social media.\"We've always said, whether the law was enforceable or not, our main aim in all of this was to establish a new social norm,\" Mr Elachi says.Will it reduce harm?Putting aside the question of whether it can be done, many are still asking: should it?First, there is concern that this policy pushes children into darker parts of the web.Will it be gaming site chatrooms, which the Australia Federal Police have warned are hotbeds for radicalisation but are excluded from the ban?Will it be sites like Omegle, which previous generations turned to when told they were too young for mainstream social media? It allowed users to video chat randomly selected strangers and was shut down two years ago over its failure to protect minors from predators. Copycats have quickly replaced it.Children can also still browse on several of the apps, like TikTok and YouTube, without accounts, a potentially riskier minefield of unfiltered content and advertisements - several platforms currently limit these on minors' accounts. \"This law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,\" a spokesperson for the company said this week.There's plenty of criticism of big tech over moderation, but few dispute that these large platforms do it better than their smaller peers. Facebook, for example, has systems which set off alarms bells if an adult is messaging a child frequently.\"You're not stopping behaviour, you're just moving that behaviour to other platforms,\" says Tim Levy, head of online safety company Qoria and one of the trial advisers who quit. \"Telling the concerned Australian parents that it's all good now is a very dangerous message.\"The science on social media and health is complex and still evolving too. Alongside the studies linking it to poor outcomes is also evidence it can be a lifeline for some children, particularly for those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities.\"We've heard very little officially about what is being done to address the unmet needs of these more vulnerable children who for positive reasons have sought help or a sense of belonging and connection online,\" former children's commissioner Anne Hollonds tells the BBC.Her term finished just a few weeks ago, but Ms Hollonds has spent years lobbying the government on greater online guard-rails for kids and was surprised, frustrated even, to learn this \"blunt\" tool was the one they've chosen.What could be achieved if this regulatory effort and attention was used to pull other levers, she wonders.Many have suggested the focus should be on forcing socials to better police harmful content and limit the power of algorithms, while also preparing children for the reality of life on the web.More than 140 leading Australian and international experts signed an open letter raising these concerns, among others, before the legislation passed.\"There's nothing magical about the age of 16,\" Ms Hollonds says. \"[This] really does nothing on its own.\"Getty ImagesAustralia's top eSafety official (right) once advocated against a banBefore her agency was officially charged with implementing this policy, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant made similar arguments.\"We do not fence the ocean or keep children entirely out of the water, but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,\" she said in June last year.To that, Minister Wells counters: \"We can police the sharks\" – a biting reference to social media firms.Many of the critics are right about the challenges ahead, she told the BBC. But this is just a starting point – a digital duty of care, a legal obligation that firms prevent foreseeable harm to their users, is next on her list.\"For every person that says to me, 'Why haven't you included these big elements?', someone else is saying to me, 'It is impossible for you to do what you've even set out to do now'.\"\"This isn't a cure. It's a treatment plan, and treatment plans will always evolve.\"\"This is, at the end of the day, work to try and save a generation. It's worth doing.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoVikas Pandey,GoaandHarry SekulichTwenty five people have been killed in a fire at a popular nightclub in the coastal region of Goa, India, local officials say.The majority of victims are believed to be staff at the club in Arpora, North Goa, while tourists are also among the dead. Police believe a gas cylinder exploded in the club's kitchen, causing a blaze to rip through the venue on Saturday at midnight local time.On Sunday morning, officials said the death toll had risen from an earlier figure of 23. Six more people are in a stable condition in hospital.The BBC has spoken to witnesses at the scene who described scenes of panic in the bustling nightlife area.\"The fire was mainly concentrated around the kitchen area on the ground floor,\" said Alok Kumar, Goa's Director General of Police.\"The fire occurred around midnight. It has now been brought under control.\"Most of the bodies were found around the kitchen \"suggesting that the victims were employed at the club,\" Mr Alok Kumar added.Goa's chief minister Pramod Sawant told journalists three people died from burn injuries, while others died by suffocating.He said \"three to four\" tourists had died but did not provide their ages or nationalities. The Indian Express reports the fire broke out at a club called Birch by Romeo Lane at Baga, located at the one of the coastal region's most popular beaches.The area where the fire occurred is lined with similar nightlife hotspots, where tourists and partygoers can be seen pouring out of the bustling clubs.A chef who works at a nearby venue told the BBC he knew some of the workers at the Birch club.\"People from all over the country and also from Nepal work in different clubs in Goa,\" he said.\"I am really worried for some people who I knew at the club. Their phones are off.\"Rescue efforts were still ongoing in the early hours of Sunday morning. Crews were combing through the charred wreckage to determine the cause of the blaze.A heavy security presence remained at the scene on Sunday morning, with the doors to the nightclub shut and no one allowed inside.The BBC saw what appeared to be charred and melted remains of chairs, tables and plants in one corner of the club.One eyewitness said that it was a usual Saturday night and holidaymakers were enjoying themselves.He said: \"I was outside the club when I heard screams, I didn't initially understand what was going on. \"In a bit, it became clear that a massive fire had broken out. Nobody could do much. The scenes were just horrific.\"Rescue workers have taken the bodies of the victims to Goa Medical College in Panaji.One of the firefighters at the scene told the BBC they are still identifying the victims and will then notify their families.A formal inquiry into the cause of the fire has been launched, the chief minister said.\"Those found responsible will face most stringent action under the law – any negligence will be dealt with firmly,\" Dr Sawant said.\"I am deeply grieved and offer my heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved families in this hour of unimaginable loss.\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Goa fire \"deeply saddening\" in a post on social media.Goa is former Portuguese colony on the Arabian Sea. Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.About 5.5 million tourists visited Goa in the first half of the year, government data showed, with 270,000 visiting from abroad.India has seen a number of deadly fires at entertainment venues in recent years.A fire at a three-storey building killed 17 in the southern city of Hyderabad in May, while a hotel blaze in north-east Kolkata left 15 dead a month earlier.Last year, 24 died at an amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat after visitors were trapped inside due to the collapse of a temporary structure at the entrance. An official review later found poor safety standards contributed to a higher death toll.",

    "body": "A drone attack on the town of Kalogi, in Sudan's South Kordofan region, is said to have hit a kindergarten and killed at least 50 people, including 33 children. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group battling the army in Sudan's civil war, was accused of Thursday's attack by a medical organisation, the Sudan Doctors' Network, and the army.There was no immediate comment from the RSF. The RSF in turn accused the army of hitting a market on Friday in a drone attack in the Darfur region, on a fuel depot at the Adre border crossing with Chad.Sudan has been ravaged by war since April 2023 when a power struggle broke out between the RSF and the army, who were formerly allies .The reports could not be verified independently.   According to the army-aligned foreign ministry, the kindergarten was struck twice with missiles from drones.Civilians and medics who rushed to the school were also attacked, it added.Responding to reports of the attack in Kalogi, a spokesman for the UN children's agency Unicef said: \"Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children's rights.\"\"Children should never pay the price of conflict,\" Sheldon Yett added.The agency, he said, urged \"all parties to stop these attacks immediately and allow safe, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to reach those in desperate need\".The RSF accused the army of attacking the Adre crossing because it was used for the \"delivery of aid and commercial supplies\". According to the Sudan War Monitor, a group of researchers tracking the conflict, the attack caused civilian casualties and significant damage to a market.The military did not immediately comment on the reports from Darfur.Wedged between Sudan's capital Khartoum and Darfur, the region made up of North Kordofan, South Kordofan and West Kordofan has been a frontline in the civil war.The battle for the Kordofans - which have a population of almost eight million - has intensified as the army pushes towards Darfur.",

    "body": "Russia continued its air strikes on Ukraine overnight, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had a \"very constructive\" phone call with Donald Trump's negotiating team following three days of talks in Florida.Early on Sunday the mayor of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in central Ukraine, said the city had been repeatedly struck in a \"massive\" attack. No deaths have been confirmed so far.Meanwhile, Russia said it had shot down 77 Ukrainian drones in several locations.Aerial assaults have continued even as efforts to negotiate an end to the war have intensified, including detailed Ukraine-US talks in Miami aimed at drafting a peace settlement acceptable to both sides.On Saturday, Zelensky said he was \"determined\" to continue working with the US after speaking to Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the conclusion of those negotiations. Zelensky said they had discussed how to ensure that Russia stuck to any potential deal to end the war.Hours later, Kremenchuk Mayor Vitaliy Maletsk said his city had sustained a \"massive combined strike\" on its infrastructure. The extent of the damage was unclear as of Sunday morning but the mayor said water, electricity and heat had been cut off for some.The city, which is roughly halfway between Kyiv and the frontline in the east, has been repeatedly targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The White House has pushed Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a multi-point plan to end the war but there has been little sign of a breakthrough, despite both sides engaging with the US-led process.\"Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,\" Zelensky said on X. \"We covered many aspects and went through key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full scale invasion.\"The Russian strikes in the early hours of Sunday followed a wider attack 24 hours earlier, which drew condemnation from Kyiv's European allies.In a social media post, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had spoken to Zelensky and offered his \"full solidarity\". \"France is determined to work with all partners to secure de-escalation measures and to impose a ceasefire,\" Macron added. Macron, Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are due to hold in-person talks in London on Monday.Europe has pushed back against early versions of the US-led peace plan and has sought to win support from the White House for its own proposals, including comprehensive security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, including the possibility of a peacekeeping force.Sir Keir has led the push for a so-called coalition of the willing, a loose collection of Ukrainian allies who are committed to continuing to underwrite Kyiv's defence in the event of a ceasefire to deter a second invasion. He has called that proposal \"vital\" for Ukraine's long-term security.Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the idea of such a force saying any troops deployed to Ukraine would be \"legitimate targets\".Also on Saturday, US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\".The joint statement was issued days after Witkoff returned from talks with Putin at the Kremlin which failed to produce a breakthrough.Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, newly installed as Zelensky's most senior negotiator, said they had \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\".",

    "body": "At least 11 people – including a three-year-old child – have been killed in a mass shooting at a hostel in South Africa.Fourteen others were wounded when gunmen stormed the venue in Saulsville township, west of the capital Pretoria, early on Saturday.At least three unknown gunmen began firing \"randomly\" at a group of people who were drinking, police spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said. The motive of the shooting is unknown and no arrests have been made. It is the latest in a string of mass shootings that have rocked the crime-ridden country in recent years.The gunmen reportedly entered the premise at 04:30 local time (02:30 GMT) and opened fire on a group of men who were drinking. A 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl were among those killed in the attack.\"I can confirm that a total of 25 people were shot,\" Mathe said. Describing the hostel as an \"illegal shebeen\", she added: \"We are having a serious challenge when it comes to these illegal and unlicensed liquor premises,\" where she said the majority of mass shootings occur.\"Innocent people also get caught up in the crossfire,\" she told public broadcaster SABC.In a major crackdown, police shut down 12,000 such premises outlets between April and September this year and arrested more than 18,000 people across the country.South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, at 45 people per 100,000 according to 2023-24 figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Some 63 people were killed every day between April and September, according to police data.",

    "body": "The death toll in Indonesia from recent flooding has passed 900, with hundreds still missing.More than 100,000 homes were destroyed when a rare and powerful cyclone formed over the Malaca Strait last week, bringing torrential rain and landslides to parts of the South East Asian country.Efforts to reach people in areas still cut off are ongoing, with aid having to be airdropped into some places.The Indonesia floods were one of several extreme weather events to hit Asia in recent weeks, with the cumulative death toll in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam approaching 2,000. In Aceh Tamiang, one of the hardest-hit areas of Indonesia, survivors described villages being entirely swept away by fast-moving deluges.One survivor in Lintang Bawah Village told the BBC Indonesian service that people survived by sitting on top of their homes.Fitriana said: \"There were also those who survived on the roofs of their houses with their four-year-old children, for three days without eating or drinking.\"She said around 90% of the homes in her village were destroyed, leaving 300 families with nowhere to go.One man recounted how he and his family were evacuated by boat when the floodwaters inundated his home up to the second floor, only for them to need to flee again from a nearby village.He said: \"That night, while we were sleeping, water suddenly soaked the mattresses we were sleeping on [in Gampoeng Dalam Village]. But we couldn't go anywhere else, because there was no higher ground.\"Luckily, my daughter-in-law's house was on two levels. So we climbed upstairs and that's where we survived.\"The region's governor said response teams were still searching for bodies in \"waist-deep\" mud, according to the AFP news agency. He said: \"Many people need basic necessities. Many areas remain untouched in the remote areas of Aceh.\"People are not dying from the flood, but from starvation. That's how it is.\"Indonesian media reported inmates were released from one prison when floodwaters threatened to engulf the facility, with officials saying there was nowhere else for them to be sent.Land access to two areas, Sibolga City and Central Tapanuli, remained cut off as of Sunday, with aid only able to reach them by air and sea respectively. There have been reports of looting at supermarkets in some areas.",

The BBC understands that Meghan tried to contact him earlier today, but it is not clear whether the attempt was successful. The relationship between Meghan and her father broke down in the run-up to her wedding to Prince Harry in 2018.During the couple's engagement, the media interest in Thomas Markle and his family was intense. Mr Markle was found to have colluded with photographers who paid him for photos appearing to show the father of the bride preparing for the wedding.The fallout saw him pull out of his daughter's wedding just days before the ceremony in Windsor, citing health problems.King Charles III - who was then the Prince of Wales - walked Meghan down the aisle instead.It is not clear if Meghan ever resumed any proper relationship with her father following her marriage. Thomas Markle is not believed to have met Harry and Meghan's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.He was critical of his daughter and son-in-law's decision to step back from public duty in the UK and criticise the royal family. In one media interview he said: \"I think they're both turning into lost souls at this point.\"\"I don't know what they're looking for,\" he added. \"I don't think they know what they're looking for.\"",

    "body": "Border clashes have erupted again between Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban forces, with each sides accusing the other of breaking a fragile ceasefire.Residents fled the Afghan city of Spin Boldak overnight, which lies along the 1,600-mile (2,600 km) border between the two countries.A medical worker in the nearby city of Kandahar told BBC Pashto that four bodies had been brought to a local hospital. Four other people were wounded. Three were reportedly wounded in Pakistan.There has been sporadic fighting between the two countries in recent months, while Afghanistan's Taliban government has also accused Pakistan of carrying out air strikes inside the country.Both sides have confirmed they exchanged fire overnight but each blamed the other for initiating the four hours of fighting. Mosharraf Zaidi, a spokesperson for Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accused the Taliban of \"unprovoked firing\".The statement continued: \"An immediate, befitting & intense response has been given by our armed forces. Pakistan remains fully alert & committed to ensuring its territorial integrity & the safety our citizens.\"Meanwhile, a Taliban spokesperson said Pakistan had \"once again initiated attacks\" and said it was \"forced to respond\".Residents on the Afghan side of the border said the exchange of fire started at around 22:30 (18:00 GMT) on Friday.Footage from the area showed a large number of Afghans fleeing on foot and in vehicles. Ali Mohammed Haqmal, head of Kandahar's information department, said Pakistan's forces had attacked with \"light and heavy artillery\" and civilian homes had been hit by mortar fire.The latest clashes came less than two months after both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey.It ended more than a week of fighting in which dozens were killed - the worst clashes between Pakistan and the Taliban since the group returned to power in 2021 - though tensions have remained high.The government in Islamabad has long accused Afghanistan's ruling Taliban of giving shelter to armed groups which carry out attacks in Pakistan.The Taliban government denies the accusation and has accused Pakistan of blaming others for their \"own security failures\".The Pakistan Taliban have carried out at least 600 attacks on Pakistani forces over the past year, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.Last week delegations from both sides met in Saudi Arabia for a fourth round of negotiations on a wider peace settlement, but did not reach an agreement.Sources familiar with the talks told BBC News that both sides had agreed to continue with the ceasefire.",

    "body": "14 hours agoSebastian UsherBBC Middle East analystThe Iranian judiciary says two organisers of a marathon have been arrested for allowing women who were not wearing hijabs to take part.The move comes after images appeared online of unveiled women competing in the race on Friday.Around 2,000 women and 3,000 men took part separately in the marathon on Kish Island off the southern coast of Iran.Dressed in red t-shirts, some of the female competitors were clearly not wearing the hijab or any other head covering.This drew very different reactions. Many supporters of change in Iran enthusiastically hailed the images as further evidence of Iranian women rejecting the restrictions placed by the authorities on what they can wear.For their part, Iranian officials have responded to it as an unacceptable challenge to the status quo.The judiciary has moved quickly against the organisers.It is not just the flouting of the rules on the hijab by some female competitors but that the marathon was held at all that has drawn condemnation from the country theocratic Islamic leadership.Just a few years ago, the sight of so many Iranian women in sports gear participating in such a mass public event – even if segregated from male participants – would have been seen as a contravention.The prosecutor in Kish said the way that the race was being held was in itself a \"violation of public decency\". The issue of the hijab remains at the heart of the debate on where Iran might be going.Government action against women appearing in public without a head covering has varied - sometimes permitting a loosening of the rules, at others mounting a clampdown on any transgression.The mass protests that rocked Iran for months three years ago were triggered by the death of the young Kurdish Iranian woman, Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after being detained over an alleged breach of the dress code.Since the protests were quelled through force and mass arrests, some Iranian women have continued to defy the rules.That has prompted a recent pushback by the authorities.The head of the judiciary has warned of a renewed campaign against women not wearing the hijab in public.Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said that intelligence agencies had been ordered to identify and report on what he called \"organised trends promoting immorality and non-veiling\". There is clearly no end for now in the standoff between Iran's leaders and many of its own people – particularly in the younger generation – over how women are allowed to dress.",

    "body": "17 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, BethlehemWatch: Bethlehem Christmas tree lights up for first time since Gaza warFor two years during the Gaza war, all public celebrations for Christmas were cancelled in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank – where Christians believe Jesus was born.But after the recent ceasefire, the holy city decided that this year the festivities would return as symbolised by the lighting of its traditional, giant Christmas tree in front of the historic Nativity Church.\"It's been a bad two years of silence; no Christmas, no jobs, no work,\" says Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati. \"We're all living here from tourism and tourism was down to zero.\"The mayor accepts that the idea of resuming celebrations was not without controversy, as suffering continues in Gaza – including for those in its tiny Christian community, many of whom have relatives in Bethlehem.\"Some may say it's not appropriate and others say it's appropriate,\" Mr Canawati tells me. \"But deep inside my heart, I felt that this was the right thing to do because Christmas should never be stopped or cancelled. This is the light of hope for us.\"Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to BethlehemOne tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare systemAlaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurantThe grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.",

    "body": "North American leaders take stage together for the first time1 day agoBernd Debusmann Jr,at the White HouseandNadine Yousif,in Toronto Watch: World Cup hosts Trump, Sheinbaum and Carney take stage togetherIt was all smiles at Washington DC's Kennedy Centre as the leaders of the US, Mexico and Canada took the stage for the 2026 World Cup draw, even as trade tensions simmered in the background.For Donald Trump, the brief interaction marked his first meeting with Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum, who leads the largest trading partner for the US. While Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has already met with Trump several times, trade talks have been halted. Trump this week signalled that the US is still weighing whether it will leave in place a single long-standing free trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico or look at separate bilateral deals.The agreement - known as the USMCA - is up for a mandatory review next year. Carney has credited it with shielding Canadian businesses from the bulk of US-imposed tariffs on Canada. Those underlying tensions seemed distant on Friday, when the leaders took the stage together to select the balls of their own countries from bowls, marking the beginning of a process to select groups for the initial stage of the jointly-hosted tournament. The leaders' body language appeared cordial and warm. Collectively, they posed for a selfie with Fifa President Gianni Infantino on stage. Reporters later saw Trump sitting with Sheinbaum, who had said earlier in the week that she planned to have a brief one-on-one with Trump to discuss trade matters, including steel, aluminium and automobile tariffs, on the sidelines of the event.The Trump administration has largely backed away from threats to impose steep tariffs as negotiations continue. Carney was sitting beside Sheinbaum. Both have expressed an interest in securing the future of the USMCA, which has been in place in some form since 1994. Its fate is uncertain pending the outcome of the mandatory review due to be completed in the summer of 2026.Trump also met for a brief 45 minutes with Sheinbaum and Carney on Friday.In a statement, Sheinbaum said they talked about the World Cup and separately  \"agreed to continue working together on trade issues with our teams\".Carney's office said the three agreed to keep working together on the USMCA. Getty ImagesThe US, Mexico and Canada are jointly hosting next year's Fifa World Cup. Trump told reporters in the White House on Wednesday that the US will \"either let it expire, or we'll maybe work out another deal with Mexico and Canada\".He added that he believed both Canada and Mexico had \"taken advantage\" of the US.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told news outlet Politico on Thursday that Trump is considering dividing the agreement into two parts.\"Our relationship with the Canadian economy is totally different than our relationship with the Mexican economy,\" Greer said, adding: \"It actually doesn't make a ton of economic sense why we would marry those three together.\"The current USMCA deal was signed by Trump during his first term. At the time, he praised it as \"the best agreement we've ever made\".American businesses have so far signalled that they want the trade agreement to remain in place.At a three-day public hearing about the coming review of the agreement in Washington this week, speakers from agriculture, business and policy groups said it has allowed them to access Canadian and Mexican markets.The World Cup draw also saw President Trump receive the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize, which Infantino said was \"in recognition of his exceptional and extraordinary actions to promote peace and unity around the world\".In brief remarks, Trump said that award was \"one of the honours\" of his life.

    "body": "1 day agoBrandon Drenon,Washington DC andMadeline HalpertThe US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on whether some children born in the US have a constitutional right to citizenship.On his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump signed an order to end birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are in the country illegally, but the move was blocked by multiple lower courts.No date has been set yet for the Supreme Court arguments, and a ruling is months away.Whatever the court decides could have major implications for Trump's immigration crackdown and for what it means to be an American citizen.For nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces.The language of the amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"Trump's executive order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or are in the country on temporary visas. It is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reform the nation's immigration system and combat what they have called \"significant threats to national security and public safety\".The administration has argued the 14th Amendment clause \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the amendment excludes children of people who are not in the country permanently or lawfully.Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, told the BBC's news partner CBS that no president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,\"  Ms Wang said in a statement. \"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term,\" she added.The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.After legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal  court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.Trump then went to the Supreme Court to fight the injunctions. In a win for Trump, the court ruled in June that the injunctions issued by the lower courts exceeded their authority, though it did not address the issue of birthright citizenship itself. The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.US Solicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the amendment was adopted \"to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens\".He has said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on US soil confers citizenship and has argued that that understanding has had \"destructive consequences\"About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2016 - a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007, according to The Pew Research Center.By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.A study published in May by the thinktank Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University's Population Research Institute suggested that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the size of the unauthorized population in the US by an additional 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.",

    "body": "A National Guardsman is on the mend after he was critically injured in an ambush-style shooting last month in Washington DC. The parents of Andrew Wolfe, 24, say \"his head wound is slowly healing and that he's beginning to 'look more like himself'\", said West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey. The family expects the Air Force staff sergeant to be in acute care for the next two to three weeks, and they feel optimistic about his progress, Morrisey said in a statement.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of two West Virginia National Guard members shot when a gunman opened fire not far from the White House on 26 November. His colleague, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, died from her injuries. \"We continue to ask all West Virginians and Americans for their prayers!\" the governor said in his statement. Morrisey attended a vigil on Friday evening for Staff Sgt Wolfe at Musselman High School in Inwood, West Virginia, where the guardsman was once a student.A pastor at the vigil read a message from the soldier's parents, Jason and Melody Wolfe.\"We know that there is a long road to go,\" they wrote, according to local news outlet Metro News. \"But our faith keeps us hopeful. We remain grateful for the prayers and the support from people all over the world.\"Earlier in the week, the governor said Staff Sgt Wolfe had responded to a nurse with a thumbs-up and was able to move his toes.Police have charged the suspected shooter, an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, with first-degree murder and assault with intent to kill.Before coming to the US in 2021, he was once a counterterrorism soldier in a CIA-backed unit that worked with American troops in Afghanistan.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of 2,000 National Guard members whom President Donald Trump deployed to the nation's capitol in August as part of his immigration and crime-related crackdown in Democratic-led cities. Following the shooting, Trump said he wanted another 500 National Guard troops sent to the nation's capital. The Trump administration has also cited the shooting as a reason for additional immigration crackdown measures.They have cancelled all citizenship ceremonies for immigrants from 19 countries that were part of a travel ban announced over the summer, including Afghanistan.

    "body": "2 hours agoTessa WongSingaporeGetty ImagesHongkongers are mourning the worst blaze the city has seen in more than 70 yearsHongkongers are voting in an election seen as a test of public sentiment following a deadly fire that angered some in the city.The government has mounted a huge campaign to encourage Hongkongers to choose members of the Legislative Council (LegCo). All of the candidates have been vetted to ensure they are loyal to China.The election takes place as many are mourning the Tai Po fire last month which killed nearly 160 people.In recent days, authorities have distributed aid to survivors, arrested suspects and sought to improve building safety, as some Hongkongers raise questions about the incident.A total of 161 candidates are competing for 90 seats in the LegCo, which acts as a mini parliament and can make and amend laws.The election is the second since 2021 when China made sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system to ensure only \"patriots\" could run for seats. Beijing has said the changes, which were put in place shortly after the 2019 protests, were necessary to ensure stability in Hong Kong, but critics say they weakened democracy.The last poll, which took place shortly after those changes, saw its lowest-ever turnout of 30% amid widespread voter apathy.This year, the government has blanketed the city with posters urging Hongkongers to head to the polls, while dangling freebies and shopping discounts.After casting their vote, each person will receive a \"thank you card\" that could be redeemed for vouchers in selected shops and restaurants, or for beauty services, medical check-ups and insurance policy premiums.Authorities are also offering free entry to public swimming pools and museums on the polling day, organising carnivals in various neighbourhoods, and holding a televised variety show and gala. They have also created cartoon mascots and a theme tune for the election, adapted from a 2001 hit song by Cantopop star Aaron Kwok, called \"Let's Vote, Together We Create The Future\".Chief Secretary Eric Chan told reporters last month that the measures were aimed at ensuring \"a happy and festive mood\" and to \"let residents recognise the importance of the election\".VCG via Getty ImagesThe Hong Kong government has launched a campaign urging residents to voteBut in recent days the city has been focusing on the 26 November fire that engulfed high-rise residential blocks at Wang Fuk Court in the northern district of Tai Po.The blaze was the worst seen in Hong Kong in more than 70 years. The death toll, which currently stands at 159, is likely to rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.As Hong Kong mourns its dead, some are asking whether the fire could have been prevented and questioning building safety standards. Many Hongkongers live in ageing high-rise buildings similar to Wang Fuk Court.Authorities have since ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of the fire, and have arrested 13 people for suspected manslaughter. They have also ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh used in all building renovations across the city. Investigators have found that a scaffolding mesh used for renovations in Wang Fuk Court failed to meet flame retardant standards, and that the fire spread quickly due to the mesh and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings.Authorities have also moved quickly to quell dissent. Police have reportedly detained a man, who was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry, for suspected sedition on Saturday. The petition was also wiped from the Internet.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police.Political campaigning for the LegCo election was immediately suspended following the fire, though government-organised debate forums resumed after a few days. Carnivals organised for the election campaign have also been cancelled.Hong Kong chief executive John Lee has insisted the LegCo election continue as planned as \"we must move forward before we can turn our grief into strength\".He said that the new legislators would be able to quickly support reconstruction and reforms.John P Burns, emeritus professor and Chinese politics expert with the University of Hong Kong, said he believed the government would interpret a high turnout as a sign that voters perceive Hong Kong's reshaped political system as \"relatively legitimate\".But he expected the numbers to be low, in part due to the Tai Po fire.He pointed out that most Hongkongers have traditionally supported the pan-democrat opposition - which have been effectively barred from taking part. \"I think they won't be convinced to participate this time, just as they mostly stayed away in 2021,\" he said.Mobilising the pro-establishment voters following the fire would be difficult for the government as well, he added.Some in that camp will be impressed by how authorities have speedily re-housed those made homeless in the fire and the aid authorities have provided, \"which by any measure has been rapid and relatively generous\", noted Prof Burns.But others \"may stay away from the polls\" as they are \"disappointed, even angry, by the governance problems the fire has exposed\", he said.Hong Kong's national security office this week reposted a commentary from a pro-Beijing news outlet that urged residents to vote to show support for government's reconstruction efforts.\"Building a good future together starts with this vote. If you truly love Hong Kong, you should sincerely vote,\" the commentary said.VCG via Getty ImagesHong Kong has been blanketed with posters for the Legco electionThis year's LegCo election will feature a number of new faces with about a quarter of the incumbent lawmakers stepping down.Local media have reported that Beijing pressured several lawmakers to retire as they have unofficially set an age limit. A number of those stepping down are aged above 70, including the prominent politician Regina Ip, a former security chief nicknamed the \"Iron Lady\". ",

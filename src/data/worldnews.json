    "body": "A diamond-studded locket swallowed by a New Zealand man who tried to steal it has been \"recovered\", police say.The Fabergé egg locket, valued at NZ$33,585 ($19,300; £14,600), was recovered in a \"natural\" manner. \"Medical intervention [was] not required,\" they told the BBC.This comes about a week after police arrested the 32-year-old man at Partridge Jewellers in central Auckland, minutes after he allegedly ate the locket.The ingested loot is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, according to the jeweller's website, and opens to reveal an 18-carat gold miniature octopus.The man has been charged with theft.Earlier this week, New Zealand police said the man had undergone a medical assessment and is constantly being monitored.\"Given this man is in police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred,\" police said then.The Octopussy egg, as it is named, was inspired by the 1983 James Bond film of the same name, which centres on an elaborate Fabergé egg heist.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.Partridge Jewellers said the locket will be returned to Fabergé, Radio NZ reported.The suspect is due to appear in court again on 8 December.According to charge sheets seen by the BBC, he has also been charged with allegedly stealing an iPad from the same jewellery store on 12 November and making away with cat litter and flea control products worth NZ$100 from a private address a day after.",

    "body": "The man accused of assassinating former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has apologised to the ex-leader's family for the first time.Tetsuya Yamagami, who earlier pleaded guilty to murder, told the court on Thursday that he felt \"deeply sorry\" towards Abe's widow, Akie.Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. He died in the hospital on the same day.Abe's death sent shockwaves around the world. He was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\".\"I have caused [the family] three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse,\" Yamagami told the court on Thursday, according to local media.He reportedly told investigators he attacked Abe because he blamed the ex-prime minister for allegedly promoting the Unification Church, which Yamagami said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.Yamagami's allegations prompted investigations into the Unification Church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings.In March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the church to disband - a ruling that the church said it would \"fight to the end\".The Unification Church has drawn controversy even before Abe's assassination, for teaching that marriage is central to spiritual salvation.Abe's grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was also Japan's prime minister, was known to have been close to the Unification Church because of its anti-communist nature. Abe himself had spoken at events related to the group.During a hearing last month, prosecutors read out a statement from Abe's widow in which she wrote: \"The sorrow of losing a husband will not be relieved.\"",

    "body": "India's travel chaos has worsened after the country's largest airline IndiGo cancelled hundreds of scheduled flights on Friday after three days of widespread disruption across its network.The carrier, which has a 60% market share in India and flies more than 2,000 flights a day, has been facing pilot shortages after it failed to adapt to new crew rostering rules.Thousands of passengers are stranded across India in what's a busy travel season, with all IndiGo flights from the capital Delhi cancelled.IndiGo has said operations will return to full normalcy only by 10 February, and has sought temporary relief on the new rules that call for more rest hours and restricted night-duty.The airline has also said it will reduce its flight operations to minimise disruptions from 8 December. The government has said it is closely monitoring the situation with the federal aviation minister expressing \"clear displeasure\" with how the airline had handled the situation. In a separate statement, India's aviation regulator said the disruptions were primarily on account of \"misjudgment and planning gaps\" in implementing the new flight duty time limitation rules. The regulator has directed IndiGo to submit a detailed plan on crew recruitment,  training, roster restructuring, safety-risk assessments and other mitigation measures with immediate effect.Local media reports say IndiGo has been granted a waiver from the new pilot rest rules, and the ban on combining pilot leave with weekly rest has been eased to stabilise operations. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this.But the airline has attracted sharp criticism from the Airline Pilots Association of India, which said any relief granted to the airline on duty timings undermines the spirit of the new regulations and \"gravely\" compromises the safety of the flying public. Under the new rules pilots are given more rest, with one of the major changes mandating pilots to make two night-time landings per week, down from six under the old rules.December is a busy travel month in India, when school holidays and the peak wedding season gets under way. IndiGo has said it will waive off all cancellation/reschedule requests for travel between 5 and 15 December. It is also arranging for hotel rooms and food for passengers whose travel has been disrupted. But several passengers have taken to social media, expressing anger about not being given up-to-date information and remaining stranded at the airport without food. Singapore's High Commissioner to India Simon Wong said he was \"lost for words\" as he joined the thousands stranded at the airport, having to miss the wedding of his young staff member. Major airports in Delhi, Mumbai and other cities have issued advisories asking passengers to check the status of their flights before heading to the airport. ",

The alert reached people nearly 200 miles away in the San Francisco Bay Area, triggering automatic warnings advising residents to drop for cover.However, the agency then cancelled the alert minutes later and removed the corresponding entry from its website.\"There was no M5.9 earthquake near Carson City, NV,\" the USGS said on X.The USGS said the alert originated from its automatic earthquake detection system, which had erroneously generated the report. It said it was believed to be the first time the agency has issued a completely false earthquake notification.An investigation is under way to determine what caused the malfunction.Multiple law enforcement agencies in cities and counties near the reported epicentre confirmed the absence of any ground movement.A magnitude 5.9 earthquake is typically strong enough to cause noticeable shaking and slight property damage, according to the Michigan Tech Earthquake Magnitude Scale.",

    "body": "3 hours agoVikas Pandey,DelhiandRuth ComerfordRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide \"uninterrupted shipments\" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil.Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow.President Donald Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on most Indian products, arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies.Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a \"peaceful solution\" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas or Russia would seize it.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on \"the side of peace\", welcoming efforts to find a \"lasting\" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the \"connectivity\" of Russia and India was a \"major priority\" for India.In recent months, India-US ties have hit an all-time low as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable\" at the time.  In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US.\"The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,\" he asked.Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, Bloomberg reported in September - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May.  The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture.Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia.Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said.No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals.India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry.Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years.Modi said that \"energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership\", but made no specific reference to oil.India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions.Putin also referenced a \"flagship project\": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with.In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being \"reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms\".Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a \"more just\" and \"multi-polar\" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations.",

    "body": "A prominent Palestinian militia leader in Gaza who opposed Hamas has been killed.Yasser Abu Shabab headed the so-called Popular Forces group, which has dozens of fighters and operates in Israeli-controlled territory near the southern city of Rafah.The Popular Forces said in a statement that Abu Shabab was shot while \"attempting to resolve a dispute\" between members of the Abu Seneima family. It dismissed as \"misleading\" reports that he was killed by Hamas, which had accused him of collaborating with Israel.An earlier statement from Abu Shabab's Bedouin tribe, the Tarabin, said he had been killed \"at the hands of the resistance\", and accused him of betraying the Palestinian people.Other sources said his death was the result of an internal power struggle.A Hamas statement said the \"fate that befell\" Abu Shabab was \"the inevitable fate of all who betray their people and homeland and are content to be tools in the hands of the occupation [Israel]\", without claiming involvement in his killing.Israel's Army Radio cited a security source as saying that Abu Shabab had died of his wounds after being evacuated to Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. But the hospital denied that he died under their care.The statement from the Popular Forces pledged to continue on Abu Shabab's \"path until the last terrorist is eliminated from the soil of Gaza and a bright and secure future is built for our people, who believe in peace\".In June, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming Palestinian clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas.It came after Israeli media reported that he had authorised the supply of weapons to the Popular Forces. However, the militia denied that it was being armed by Israel.The Popular Forces have been accused of looting humanitarian aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, which the militia has also denied. Reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began almost eight weeks ago, Abu Shabab had reportedly been one of several anti-Hamas militia leaders jostling for position in the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.It would involve setting up an interim government, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.Under the first phase, Hamas agreed to return all 48 living and dead hostages it was still holding in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, as well as a partial Israeli withdrawal and a surge in humanitarian aid.The body of one dead Israeli hostage is yet to be returned.Israel's government has previously said it would not join talks on the second phase until Hamas has returned all the hostages. However, Trump said on Wednesday that the second phase was \"going to happen pretty soon\".The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,120 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "13 hours agoAdrienne MurrayCopenhagenThe parliament of the Faroe Islands voted on Thursday to legalise abortion until the end of the 12th week of pregnancy, overturning a decades-old law that prohibited abortions in most cases.Previous legislation allowed abortions only in certain circumstances - such as rape, incest or risk to the health of the pregnant woman - and meant the self-governing Danish territory had among the most restrictive abortion policies in Europe. Following a heated parliamentary debate, the decision came down to the wire, with MPs narrowly voting in favour of the reform, by 17 to 16.\"This is truly an historic day in the Faroe Islands,\" said Ingilín Didriksen Strømm, one of the four MPs who tabled the bill.Strømm told the BBC: \"This change finally affirms women's autonomy over their own bodies in the Faroe Islands.\"\"It guarantees access to safe healthcare, and it also protects our freedom to make decisions about our own lives without fear, without stigma and without criminalisation,\" she added.The new legislation in the Faroe Islands - located between Scotland and Norway - is expected to come into effect on 1 July next year, replacing laws dating back to 1956.Under that legislation, abortions could only be performed in special circumstances - which also included if there are severe fetal health problems or if the woman is deemed \"unfit\" to care for the child.Whether a woman is \"unfit\" or not is judged first by a GP, and then a second medical body, before an abortion is granted. Both the woman and the doctor risked imprisonment if the conditions were not met.Faroese pro-choice campaigners have argued the legislation was outdated and impinged on women's rights.\"This is a colossal change,\" Bjørt Lind from pro-choice campaign group Fritt Val told Danish newspaper Politiken.\"Abortion has been so hidden and taboo in Faroese society. When we started our work, no one dared to talk about it. It has gotten much better,\" she says. \"But it's still a huge challenge.\"In a statement to the BBC, Amnesty International's Faroe Islands branch said: \"After years of campaigning we finally have a law respecting women's and all pregnant people's rights to a safe and legal abortion until week 12.\"\"This is a huge step for human rights, the right to bodily autonomy and to secure safe abortions,\"  it added. \"And Faroese women don't have to go on an expensive trip abroad to have an abortion.\"With limited access to abortions in the Faroe Islands, campaign groups said women often had to travel to Denmark for the procedure.Danish law has allowed abortion up to 12 weeks since 1973, and in June this year, that was amended to extend terminations on request until 18 weeks.According to the Centre for Reproductive Rights, some 43 countries in Europe allow \"abortion on request\" during the early stages of pregnancy. Only five - Andorra, Malta, Liechtenstein, Poland and Monaco - maintain highly restrictive laws.Those opposed to the law change in the Faroe Islands, argued that the right of the fetus should be protected. Erhard Joensen, an MP who voted against Thursday's bill, told Danish national broadcaster, DR, that he respects the result, but does not believe there is much support for the new law. \"I think we will see that some will try to roll it back,\" he said.The remote archipelago is home to around 56,000 people, who speak Faroese and have a distinct cultural identity. Compared to other Nordic countries, society in the Faroe Islands is considered relatively conservative, with more than three quarters of the population members of the Lutheran church.Previous attempts to liberalise abortion laws have failed. Most recently, in May last year, an almost identical bill resulted in a tied vote, failing to secure the majority required to pass the Faroese parliament.",

At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "2 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesNetflix has agreed to buy the film and streaming businesses of Warner Bros Discovery for $72bn (£54bn) in a major Hollywood deal.The streaming giant emerged as the successful bidder for Warner Bros ahead of rivals Comcast and Paramount Skydance after a drawn-out battle.Warner Bros owns franchises including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, and the streaming service HBO Max.The takeover is set to create a new giant in the entertainment industry, but the deal will still have to be approved by competition authorities.Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the streamer was \"highly confident\" it would receive the regulatory approval it needs and it was running \"full speed\" towards this. He said that by combining the library of Warner Bros shows and movies with the streaming platform's series such as Stranger Things, \"we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling\".\"Warner Bros have defined the last century of entertainment, and together we can define the next one,\" he said.Asked whether HBO should remain a separate streaming service, co-chief executive Greg Peters said Netflix believed the HBO brand was important for consumers, but added: \"We think it's quite early to get into the specifics of how we're going to tailor this offering for consumers.\"Netflix estimates it will find $2-3bn in savings, mostly through eliminating overlaps in the support and technology areas of the businesses.Films made by Warner Bros will continue to be launched in cinemas, it said, and Warner Bros television studio will continue to be able to produce for third parties. Netflix will keep producing content exclusively for its own platform.Murray Close/Getty ImagesWarner Bros owns the rights to the Harry Potter filmsLabelling it a \"big day\" for the companies, Mr Sarandos acknowledged the acquisition may have surprised some shareholders but it was a \"rare opportunity\" to set Netflix up for success \"for decades to come\".David Zaslav, president and chief executive of Warner Bros, added the agreement would combine \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world\".\"By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come,\" he said.The cash and stock deal is worth $27.75 per Warner Bros share, with a total enterprise value - which includes the company's debts and the value of its shares - of about $82.7bn. The equity value, or cash price, is $72bn.The boards of directors from each company unanimously approved the deal.Michael O'Leary, chief executive of trade organisation Cinema United, said the merger posed \"an unprecedented threat\" to the global  cinema business.\"The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,\" he said.Netflix will complete the takeover after Warner Bros finalises its previously announced plans to separate its streaming and studios division from its global networks division into two companies next year.Its global networks division will become Discovery Global and will include its cable channels such as CNN and TNT Sports in the US, as well as its Discovery and free-to-air channels in Europe. However, TNT Sports International will stay with the streaming and studios division being sold to Netflix.Hollywood shake-upPaolo Pescatore, founder and technology media and telecom analyst at PP Foresight, said the sale was \"a huge statement of intent and underlines Netflix aspirations to be a global leader in the new world order of streaming\".But he warned that while the \"surprising move\" made sense for Warner Bros, it could \"provide a headache for Netflix\" when trying to combine the companies given the size of the deal.While the agreed deal is for part of the Warner Bros business, rival Paramount had tabled a bid to buy the whole company, including its cable networks, in October. Warner Bros rejected this move before putting itself up for sale.Ahead of the announcement of the deal, Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the takeover would be approved by regulators, but if it went through it would have a massive impact on cinema.\"Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood,\" he said.Mr Harrington said there was likely to be \"big reductions\" in television and film output from a newly-merged company, which would lead to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant unions.For consumers, Mr Harrington said a merger was likely to lead to higher prices.\"Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be shuttered/become non-essential, the greater penetration of Netflix households would likely mean an increase in total overall subscription revenues.\"Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Netflix had \"offered an olive branch\" to Hollywood with the promise it would continue to release Warner Bros films on the big screen.\"If this deal can clear those significant regulatory hurdles quickly there are likely to be considerable cost savings to be made,\" she said. \"How much of those savings get passed to streaming platform subscribers or whether Netflix will be seen to have too much pricing power is one of the areas that will face a huge amount of scrutiny in the coming months.\"With additional reporting by Natalie Sherman",

    "body": "Olympian and other Eritreans freed after 18 years without trial, relatives tell the BBC2 hours agoTeklemariam BekitEditor, BBC TigrinyaThirteen people held for more than 18 years without trial in Eritrea have been released from a notorious military prison, relatives of the detainees have told the BBC.Among those freed were several prominent figures, including 69-year-old Olympian cyclist and businessman Zeragaber Gebrehiwot.They had been held at Mai Serwa prison, known for its harsh conditions and where many of the inmates are believed to be political prisoners.An unnamed source who was once detained in Mai Serwa told the BBC the prisoners were arrested in October 2007 following an assassination attempt on Col Simon Gebredingil, a senior internal security officer in President Isaias Afwerki's government.Around 30 people were initially detained, according to the source. Some have been released over the years, but about 20 remained in custody.Zeragaber competed in the Moscow Olympics in 1980 when Eritrea was part of Ethiopia.The mountainous country, which gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has a strong cycling culture and its cyclists have steadily gained international recognition over the past decade.Those released with Zeragaber on Thursday include prominent businessmen Tesfalem Mengsteab and Bekure Mebrahtu as well as the Habtemariam brothers - David, an engineer, and Matthews, a geometrist.Six senior police officers and an internal security agent were also freed.The Eritrean government has not issued any statement regarding the releases.Many of them are sick and this could explain why they have been released now.Families were not allowed to visit the prisoners throughout their detention, the relatives said.The UN and human rights groups have long accused the Eritrean government of gross human rights violations, including torture, forced disappearance and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of people in inhumane conditions.Mai Serwa prison, located about 9km (six miles) north-west of the capital, Asmara, has expanded over the years to include 20 metal shipping containers in which prisoners are held incommunicado, sources have told the BBC.Last year, Berhane Abrehe, who served as President Isaias's finance minister for 11 years until 2012, died in prison. He had spent six years in jail - detained after releasing a book in which he described the president as a \"dictator\" who needed to resign.He was also never taken to court. According to UK-based Human Rights Concern - Eritrea, he died in Asmara's Carshelli prison.Over the last three decades, Eritrea has remained a one-party state with no functioning constitution. It is one of the most militarised societies in the world, with indefinite military conscription.There has been no free press since the closure of independent newspapers and arrest of most of their editors and journalists in 2001.This was when the government arrested 15 politicians known as the G-15, along with 16 journalists, after they demanded that President Isaias implement the draft constitution and hold open elections.According to Amnesty International, the fate and whereabouts of 11 of the politicians, as well as the journalists accused of links to the G-15, remain unknown.Aged 79, President Isaias marked 32 years in power earlier this year and has still never faced an election.",

    "body": "Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has voted to introduce voluntary military service, in a move aimed at boosting national defences after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It marks a significant shift in Germany's approach to its military and follows Chancellor Friedrich Merz's push to create Europe's strongest conventional army.The change means that all 18-year-olds in Germany will be sent a questionnaire from January 2026 asking if they are interested and willing to join the armed forces. The form will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.Students at schools across Germany have said they will join strikes in as many as 90  cities on Friday to protest against the move.Many young Germans either oppose the new law or are sceptical.\"We don't want to spend half a year of our lives locked up in barracks, being trained in drill and obedience and learning to kill,\" the organisers of the protests wrote in a statement posted on social media.\"War offers no prospects for the future and destroys our livelihoods.\"In Hamburg alone, about 1,500 people were expected to join the protests, and school head teachers warned parents not to take their children out of school for the day.German MPs voted by 323 votes to 272 to back the change, making their country the latest European country to launch some form of revised military service. Last month, France said it was introducing 10 months of voluntary military training for 18- and 19-year-olds.The government says military service will be voluntary for as long as possible, but from July 2027, all 18-year-old men will have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for possible military service.Universal medical examinations were necessary, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said, so that in the event of an attack, Germany would not waste time determining \"who is operationally capable as a homeland protector and who is not\".Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, currently have around 182,000 service personnel, and Pistorius wants to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year.The long-term aim is to raise the number by the early 2030s to 260,000, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists, to meet new Nato force targets and strengthen Germany's defences.While the plan is for voluntary service, if the security situation worsens or if too few volunteers came forward, a form of compulsory military service could be considered by the Bundestag.If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Like other European countries, Germany ran down its armed forces during the peacetime years of the 1990s. During the Cold War it had an army of almost half a million.Compulsory military service in Germany was ended in 2011 under former chancellor Angela Merkel.But now, in the face of perceived threats from Russia and heavy pressure from Germany's traditional ally, the US, Friedrich Merz has pledged to rebuild the Bundeswehr into Europe's strongest conventional army.Nato countries have come under pressure from US President Donald Trump's White House to increase their spending on defence.Incentives for voluntary service are relatively high, with a promised salary of about €2,600 a month. In France, volunteers will be paid at least €800 (£700) a month.The Bundestag was also set to vote on Friday on a contentious pensions reform bill, which will keep the state pension at current levels until 2031.The bill is a key pillar of the coalition deal between Merz's conservatives and his centre-left partner, the Social Democrats, who have just a slender governing majority of just 12 votes.However, there had been doubts about whether it would pass the parliamentary vote, as  younger members of Merz's conservatives threatened to rebel. They say the plan is financially unsustainable and will leave younger generations shouldering the burden.But Germany's opposition far-left Left party said it would abstain from voting, which means the coalition needs fewer votes to pass it and so won't have to worry about potential rebels from its own ranks.A government crisis may narrowly have been averted.",

    "body": "19 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Cyclone catastrophe in Sri Lanka awakens volunteer spirit3 days agoIshara Danasekara,News Editor, BBC News SinhalaandKoh EweWatch: Sri Lankan communities under water after catastrophic floodingSri Lankan actor and musician GK Reginold rides a motorised fishing boat through Colombo's suburbs, hoping to bring food and water to those in desperate need.Some of the families, Mr Reginold says, have not received aid for days, isolated by the South Asian island nation's worst weather disaster in recent years.Cyclone Ditwah lashed the country last week, bringing catastrophic floods and landslides that killed more than 460 people, left hundreds missing and damaged some 30,000 homes.But the deluge has also inspired volunteerism among its people, as they face what their president has described as the \"most challenging natural disaster\" in its history.\"The main reason why I wanted to do this, is to at least help them to have one meal,\" Mr Reginold tells the BBC. \"And I was so happy that I was able to do that.\"BBC SinhalaVolunteers have been taking fishing boats out to rescue flood victims and deliver aidMore than one million people have been affected by the disaster and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency.Sri Lanka's military has deployed helicopters for rescue operations, while humanitarian aid is flowing in from foreign governments and non-governmental organisations.But it will be a long journey to recovery for Sri Lanka, which has seen its fair share of turmoil in recent years.Activists volunteer in community kitchenIn Colombo's Wijerama neighbourhood, activists who protested against former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 are now helping run a community kitchen that churns out food aid.The protests from three years ago were fuelled by a spiralling economic crisis that caused shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

    "body": "The Israeli military has carried out a new round of air strikes in southern Lebanon, less than a day after Israel and Lebanon held their first direct talks in decades.Residents of the towns of Mjadel, Baraachit, Jbaa and Mahrouna were told to evacuate areas around locations that the Israeli military alleged were weapons warehouses belonging to the Iranian-backed group. No casualties have been reported.An Israeli military spokesman said the sites constituted a ceasefire violation and warned that it would continue to operate \"to remove any threat\" to Israel. Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon since a ceasefire took effect in November 2024, following 13 months of conflict.There was no immediate comment from Lebanon's leaders in response to Thursday's strikes. Lebanese politicians have previously condemned similar strikes as ceasefire violations.Under the first phase of a deal brokered by the US and France, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to remove its fighters and weapons from south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel - a plan the group and its allies oppose.Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites and stepped up its air strikes in recent weeks. It is an escalation officials say is driven by Hezbollah's attempts to rebuild its military infrastructure and what they see as limited Lebanese government efforts to disarm the group.Thursday's strikes came less than 24 hours after Israel and Lebanon sent civilian envoys to the Lebanese border town of Naqoura for their first direct talks in decades.The talks, hosted at the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission, Unifil, took place during a meeting of the ceasefire monitoring committee, which until now had only included military officers from the US, France, Lebanon, Israel and Unifil.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying the meeting \"took place in a good atmosphere\" and that it \"was agreed that ideas would be formulated to advance possible economic cooperation between Israel and Lebanon\".It also said that Israeli envoys \"clarified that the disarmament of Hezbollah is obligatory, regardless of the advancement of economic co-operation\".Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam was more cautious, saying Lebanon remained \"far\" from diplomatic normalisation with Israel and that the talks were focused on \"defusing tension\".\"We are not yet at peace talks,\" he told reporters, saying Lebanon's priorities were the cessation of hostilities, the release of Lebanese detainees held by Israel, and Israel's full withdrawal from its territory.He added that Beirut was open to the deployment of French and US troops to help verify efforts to disarm Hezbollah.The latest strikes and diplomatic moves coincide with a visit by a UN Security Council delegation to Lebanon to review the stalled implementation of the ceasefire.",

    "body": "13 hours agoKelly NgGetty ImagesThe devastating Tai Po fire has sparked an outpouring of grief and anger in Hong KongWhen university student Miles Kwan launched a petition demanding answers from Hong Kong authorities after one of the city's deadliest fires last week, he was arrested.The ferocious blaze had ravaged a densely populated housing estate in the northern Tai Po district, killing at least 159 people and displacing thousands.As public anger grew, the pro-Beijing authorities warned, repeatedly, against attempts to \"exploit\" the fire to \"endanger national security\".Kwan was reportedly arrested by Hong Kong national security police on suspicion of sedition. He is now on bail, according to local media.Police told the BBC that it \"would handle any action taken in accordance with the law and the actual circumstances\".There was also a strong public reaction to the arrest. To some, the decision to arrest him was \"baffling\". To others, it was simply Beijing's playbook, replicated. The Hong Kong government says that it's about trying to protect rule of law in a testing moment for the city. 'A human response to tragedy'Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong's Executive Council, disputed the suggestion that Hong Kongers are being suppressed. \"The government is trying to be prudent,\" he tells the BBC.Regina Ip, another Hong Kong lawmaker, also defended the arrests. Authorities are being \"extra careful\" that public anger does not led to a \"recurrence of the 2019 riots\", she told the BBC's Newshour radio programme.Among the questions in the petition and being asked by many Hong Kongers include how the blaze could have swept through the buildings so rapidly and whether any government officials should be held responsible.\"You have to differentiate genuine expressions of opinion from petitions with criminal intent. That is what our courts will have to find out,\" Ip added.Kwan's petition, which listed \"four demands\" - echoing the \"five demands, not one less\" slogan that rallied protesters in 2019 - gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day before it was taken down. Days later, the city's leader John Lee said Hong Kong would \"go all out\" to support victims and investigate the blaze. He anounced a number of actions such as the convening of an independent committee to investigate the fire, a review of the building works system, and temporary accommodation and financial aid to victims. Many of these were what people were calling for already - and they also formed a part of Kwan's petition. \"It's baffling how Miles was [arrested] for asking basic questions on behalf of many residents, which the government went on to address anyway,\" said Samuel Chu, a pro-democracy activist who reposted Kwan's petition on a separate platform.\"This is not a political campaign. It's a human response to the tragedy,\" he said.Getty ImagesAmong the questions residents want answered include whether any government officials should be held responsibleIn the past week, authorities have also arrested 15 people on suspicion of manslaughter and ordered the removal of mesh netting from all buildings undergoing renovations after investigators found that the one wrapped around the charred complex did not meet flame retardant standards.Separately, one woman has been arrested for trying to profiteer from the crisis using a fake fundraising campaign.China's national security office in Hong Kong swung into action swiftly after last week's disaster, warning that it would take action against anyone trying to instigate \"black terror\" - a phrase Beijing had used to describe the 2019 protests.In a more strongly-worded statement this week, it vowed to punish \"hostile foreign forces... no matter how far away\" they may be.Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, said he would \"ensure justice is [served]\" to anyone who tries to \"sabotage\" relief efforts.Former district councillor Kenneth Cheung, who was among those arrested reportedly by national security police, says authorities took issue with content he re-shared on Facebook following the fire.\"The Tai Po fire is a tragedy that concerns everyone in Hong Kong. Many, regardless of their political loyalties, want the culprits to be held accountable,\" says the 50-year-old, who is out on bail but has had his passport impounded.\"Not everything is about politics,\" Cheung says.Hong Kong authorities are dealing with this disaster using Beijing's playbook, which focuses on social control and regime security, alleges Kenneth Chan, a politics professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University.He notes how authorities have over the weekend displaced community-led relief initiatives with groups backed by the government.\"Officials will not embrace the spontaneity of these grassroots efforts because they want control,\" he alleges.On social media in HK comments piled in responding to the arrest. Most of them unhappy over the arrests and the government response. \"Demanding the truth is considered incitement?\" one such comment said. Getty ImagesJohn Lee says Hong Kong will \"ensure justice is [served]\" to anyone who tries to \"sabotage\" relief effortsAsked at a news conference earlier this week why he deserves to keep his job following the fire, John Lee sidestepped the question and instead pledged to take to task \"anybody who dares to sabotage\" relief efforts.No government official has yet resigned nor been arrested over the fire. The 15 people arrested on suspicion of manslaughter are bosses or staff of construction firms, while another six detained are fire equipment contractors. Some residents have also criticised the decision to proceed with a Legislative Council election, at a time when the city is in mourning. Only pro-Beijing \"patriots\" are allowed to contest in the poll which will be held on Sunday.The issue however, is continuing to dominate discussion at all levels. Some Legislative Council members made a request for an emergency debate to discuss the fire and post disaster relief work, but this was refused, with the government saying it would keep its focus on the issue of the fire itself.In a statement to reporters Lee said, \"Yes, it is a tragedy; it is a big fire. Yes, we need a reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plugged... to ensure that such things will not happen again.\"(5 December 2025): This article and headline were updated to add more precise attribution over the basis of arrests and that Kwan is now out on bail, include a police response to the BBC and add more context about public and government reaction.",

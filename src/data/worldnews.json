    "body": "13 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoOpenAI has released new estimates of the number of ChatGPT users who exhibit possible signs of mental health emergencies, including mania, psychosis or suicidal thoughts.The company said that around 0.07% of ChatGPT users active in a given week exhibited such signs, adding that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognizes and responds to these sensitive conversations.While OpenAI maintains these cases are \"extremely rare,\" critics said even a small percentage may amount to hundreds of thousands of people, as ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users, per boss Sam Altman.As scrutiny mounts, the company said it built a network of experts around the world to advise it.Those experts include more than 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in 60 countries, the company said.They have devised a series of responses in ChatGPT to encourage users to seek help in the real world, according to OpenAI.But the glimpse at the company's data raised eyebrows among some mental health professionals.\"Even though 0.07% sounds like a small percentage, at a population level with hundreds of millions of users, that actually can be quite a few people,\" said Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor who studies technology use among young adults at the University of California, San Francisco.\"AI can broaden access to mental health support, and in some ways support mental health, but we have to be aware of the limitations,\" Dr. Nagata added.The company also estimates 0.15% of ChatGPT users have conversations that include \"explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\"OpenAI said recent updates to its chatbot are designed to \"respond safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\" and note \"indirect signals of potential self-harm or suicide risk.\"ChatGPT has also been trained to reroute sensitive conversations \"originating from other models to safer models\" by opening in a new window.In response to questions by the BBC on criticism about the numbers of people potentially affected, OpenAI said that this small percentage of users amounts to a meaningful amount of people and noted they are taking changes seriously. The changes come as OpenAI faces mounting legal scrutiny over the way ChatGPT interacts with users.In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple sued the company over the death of their teenage son alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life in April.The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.In a separate case, the suspect in a murder-suicide that took place in August in Greenwich, Connecticut posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fuelled the alleged perpetrator's delusions.More users struggle with AI psychosis as \"chatbots create the illusion of reality,\" said Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law. \"It is a powerful illusion.\"She said OpenAI deserved credit for \"sharing statistics and for efforts to improve the problem\" but added: \"the company can put all kinds of warnings on the screen but a person who is mentally at risk may not be able to heed those warnings.\" ",

    "body": "Most countries fail to submit new climate pledges ahead of summit1 hour agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesOnly 64 countries have submitted new plans to cut carbon, the UN says, despite all being required to do so ahead of next month's COP30 summit.Added together these national pledges would fail to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C, a key threshold to very dangerous levels of climate change.While the UN review does show progress in curbing carbon emissions over the next decade, the projected fall is not enough to stop temperatures surging past this global target.The report underlines the scale of the task facing world leaders who head to Belém in northern Brazil next week for the COP30 climate gathering.Ten years after the Paris climate pact was agreed in 2015, the efforts of countries to restrict the rise in global temperatures are under renewed scrutiny.Every signatory agreed to submit a new carbon-cutting plan every five years, which would cover the next decade.But only 64 countries managed to put a new pledge in place this year, despite many extensions of the deadline. These represent around 30% of global emissions.In addition, the UN's review includes statements from China and the EU on their future plans made at Climate Week in New York in September.Taken together, the efforts mean that global emissions of carbon dioxide should fall by around 10% by 2035.However, scientists say that such a drop is nowhere near enough to keep the rise in temperatures under 1.5C.To keep that goal alive will require steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, up to 57% by 2035, according to the UN last year.\"This report shows that we are going in the right direction but too slowly,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, often referred to as a key architect of the Paris Agreement.\"It is essential to acknowledge the missing national pledges and confront the persistent gap between ambition and actual implementation.\"The 1.5C limit, agreed at Paris, has long been seen as the threshold of very dangerous warming. In 2018, scientists outlined the massive benefits to the world of keeping the rise under 1.5C as compared to allowing them to rise to 2C. Passing 1.5C include more frequent and intense heatwaves and storms, increased damage to coral reefs and growing threats to human health and livelihoods, UN scientists have said.However, that limit was breached in 2024 for a whole year for the first time. UN leaders are increasingly accepting the fact that the threshold will be breached permanently by the early 2030s at current rates.Getty ImagesBrazil's President Lula visits Belém ahead of COP30 in November\"One thing is already clear: we will not be able to contain the global warming below 1.5C in the next few years,\" UN secretary general António Guterres told delegates at a meeting of the World Meteorological Organisation last week.\"Overshooting is now inevitable. Which means that we're going to have a period, bigger or smaller, with higher or lower intensity, above 1.5C in the years to come.\"Despite this, the UN is keen to stress that there are some significant green shoots in the new report that provide hope.Many more countries are expected to lodge plans as their leaders gather for COP30 in Belém in Brazil.Large carbon producers such as India and Indonesia haven't yet unveiled their carbon plans. They will likely do so during COP30 and these may have a significant impact on the overall projections for 2035.Some countries are also likely to cut faster and deeper than they've promised, say experts.\"It's actually completely reasonable to look at China,\" said Todd Stern, former US Special Envoy for climate change.\"They'll put down a certain number, which is not great, and then they will overachieve it, and China does that a lot.\"The UN says they are confident that emissions globally will likely peak and start to decline in the next few years, for the first time since the industrial revolution in the 19th century.They say the plans in place show clear stepping stones to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming \"greenhouse\" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere.One important factor is that the cuts assessed by the UN include the planned US pledge submitted under President Biden.While President Donald Trump has said he will pull out of the Paris agreement, that process is not completed yet, so the UN are keeping the US plans in their calculations even if these won't happen as planned.",

    "body": "A plane crash near Kenya's coast has killed 10 European tourists and a local pilot, officials have said. The aircraft was flying from the popular beach resort of Diani to an airstrip in the world-famous Maasai Mara game park when it went down at 05:30 local time (02:30 GMT), the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) said. Mombasa Air Safari said the plane was carrying eight Hungarians, two Germans and a Kenyan pilot, all of whom had been killed in the crash. \"Our primary focus right now is on providing all possible support to the families affected,\" it added in a statement.Local media have published images of the plane in flames, with debris scattered at the site of the crash.Kwale County Commissioner Stephen Orinde told the BBC that the plane crashed about 10km (six miles) from Kwale town after flying out of Diani.It was on its way to Kichwa Tembo, an airstrip in Maasai Mara, popular with holidaymakers because of its wildlife. \"The passengers were all tourists,\" Orinde said.He said that investigations into the cause of the crash were ongoing but suggested it could have been due to bad weather.\"The weather is not very good here at the moment. Since early in the morning, it is raining and it is very misty, but we cannot preempt [the findings],\" Orinde said.In August, a light aircraft belonging to the medical charity Amref crashed on the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi, killing six people and injuring two others.",

    "body": "57 minutes agoLiv McMahon,Technology reporter and Osmond Chia,Business reporterAmazon has confirmed it plans to cut thousands of jobs, saying it needs to be \"organised more leanly\" to seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI).The tech giant said on Tuesday it would reduce its global corporate workforce by \"approximately 14,000 roles\".Earlier reporting had suggested it was planning to lay off as many as 30,000 workers.Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon, wrote in a note to staff that the move would make the company \"even stronger\" by shifting resources \"to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs\".She acknowledged that some would question the move given the company was performing well.At the end of July, Amazon reported second quarter results which beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn).But Ms Galetti said the cuts were needed because AI was \"the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet\" and was \"enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.\"\"We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\" she added.The note, shared with Amazon employees earlier on Tuesday, said the company was \"working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted\" - including by helping those affected find new roles within Amazon.Those who cannot will receive \"transition support\" including severance pay, it said.The BBC has asked if it will affect employees in the UK.The company has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide.This includes around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, according to figures that Amazon submitted to the US government last year.Like many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services.Amazon boss Andy Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in AI tools to boost efficiency.Mr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools will likely lead to job cuts as machines take over routine tasks.\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" he said then.The company has carried out several rounds of cuts to its corporate division in recent years.It laid off around 27,000 workers over several months in 2022, as rivals similarly looked to reverse hiring increases made during the pandemic.But analysts said its more subdued profit guidance for the forthcoming quarter had left some sceptical of the value of its enormous AI investments and whether they would pay off.Slower growth for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, also sparked concern among some investors.Amazon will report its latest quarterly results on Thursday for the period ending 30 September.",

    "body": "53 minutes agoBasillioh Rukanga and Akisa Wandera,BBC AfricaSudan's military chief has confirmed the army's withdrawal from its last western stronghold of el-Fasher after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) declared control of the city.In a televised address on Monday evening, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said he had approved the withdrawal in response to the \"systematic destruction and killing of civilians\".He said he had agreed with local leaders to \"leave and go to a safe place to protect the remaining citizens and the rest of the city from destruction\".The UN has raised the alarm over reports of atrocities committed by the RSF in recent days, and has called for safe passage for trapped civilians. The RSF has consistently denied accusations of killing civilians.The fall of el-Fasher could mark a significant turning point in Sudan's civil war, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million people since April 2023.The RSF now has complete control of the vast Darfur region, while the army is confined to the north, east and centre of Sudan.The RSF has been besieging el-Fasher for 18 months, trapping hundreds of thousands of civilians in the city and sparking a hunger crisis. El-Fasher siege: My son's whole body is full of shrapnel'A pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zoneThe RSF has been widely accused of committing large-scale atrocities in el-Fasher since Sunday alone, when the paramilitary group declared that it had captured the city.According to Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab, satellite imagery shows \"evidence of mass killing\".The researchers found clusters of what appear to be human bodies near RSF vehicles and beside the 57-kilometre-long earthen wall that now surrounds the city, suggesting civilians may have been executed while trying to flee.The Joint Force, an alliance of Darfuri armed groups supporting the military, said 2,000 civilians had been killed since the city fell. There is no independent confirmation of this. Aid agencies now fear a massacre of non-Arab ethnic groups stuck in el-Fasher. The RSF has denied targeting them, despite evidence of war crimes presented by the UN and human rights organisations.On Monday, the UN head, Antonio Guterres, said he was \"gravely concerned\" over the situation in the city, and condemned the reported \"violations of international humanitarian law\".Gen Burhan denounced inaction by the international community to end the violations in his address on Monday, and vowed to fight \"until this land is purified\".\"We can turn the tables every time, and we can return every land desecrated by these traitors to the nation's fold,\" he said.",

She previously claimed she was tortured to bring the drugs.Under the plea bargain agreement, her family paid 500,000 Georgian Lari (£137,000) to significantly reduce her sentence.More than 90% of drug-related crimes in Georgia are resolved through plea bargains.Miss Culley will remain in pre-trial detention until the next hearing on Monday.ReutersLyanne Kennedy, speaking to reporters outside court, said her 19-year-old daughter was \"looking strong\"Miss Culley is currently believed to be 35 weeks pregnant.Speaking outside court, her mother said: \"We've confirmed that the funds have been sent but they need to confirm that they have been received and that is not going to happen until tomorrow.\"She is looking big, pregnant, but she is looking strong.\"Malkhaz Salakaia, representing Miss Culley, said the negotiations \"are nearing completion\".He said: \"Plea bargain conditions are known to the family.\"There is a technical issue to be resolved which will take a few days.\"Mr Salakaia previously said he planned to appeal to the president of Georgia to pardon her after finalising the plea deal.Rayhan Demytrie/BBCBella Culley is being detained at prison number 5Miss Culley initially went missing in Thailand before being arrested at Tbilisi International Airport on 10 May.It is understood she arrived on a flight from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates and police seized drugs from a travel bag.At a hearing in July, she pleaded not guilty to charges of possession and trafficking illegal drugs and claimed she had been \"forced to do this through torture\".\"I just wanted to travel,\" she said. \"I am a good person.

He had met the girl on Facebook and travelled to England from Amsterdam before raping her in her home in 2014.Two weeks ago, South Australia's Attorney-General Kyam Maher wrote to the federal government, calling on authorities to reject his visa as his crimes were \"utterly abhorrent\".The letter also said \"we do not believe that foreign child sex offenders should be granted entry to this country\".Australia's Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government will \"continue to use every tool we have available to ensure that Australians can be safe and feel safe in their communities\".After the rape in 2014, Van de Velde returned to the Netherlands but in 2016, he was extradited to the UK and arrested. Ahead of his sentencing, the court heard he was aware of the girl's age.He served 12 months of his four-year sentence and restarted his professional sporting career in 2018, playing for his national team in several global tournaments.Last year, he represented the Netherlands at the Paris Olympics and was booed by some people in the crowd. Earlier, an online petition calling for him to be banned from the Olympics had attracted 90,000 signatures.The BBC has contacted the organisers of the world championship event in South Australia and the Dutch national volleyball association for comment.

    "body": "A man accused of killing former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial.Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, told a court in the capital Tokyo that \"everything is true\", according to local media. Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara in 2022.Abe - who was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\" - was struck several times, and died in hospital later the same day, sending shockwaves around the world.The assassination shone a spotlight on links between Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Unification Church, more popularly known as the \"Moonies\".Yamagami is reported to have told investigators he targeted Abe because he blamed the 67-year-old for allegedly promoting the church, which he said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.He alleged his mother made donations, said to total about 100 million yen ($660,000), as proof of her faith to the church.The allegations prompted investigations into the church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings, and led to four ministers resigning.Then, in March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the disbandment of the church, stripping it of its tax exempt status and requiring it to liquidate its assets. But Yamagami's mother - who is expected to be called as a witness - has reportedly not wavered in her beliefs, telling Japanese media that the killing has made her faith stronger, according to the Japan Times.Yamagami's trial is not expected to conclude until January, with the defendant denying charges relating to violation of arms control laws. His lawyer told the court the homemade weapon did not fall into the correct category, Japan's NHK said.Japan, which has very low levels of gun violence, has further strengthened its laws around homemade guns since Abe's killing.",

    "body": "Freddie Freeman hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 18th inning as the Los Angeles Dodgers took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven World Series, beating the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 in an epic game lasting more than six-and-a-half hours.It was the joint longest postseason game in Major League Baseball history in terms of innings, with no runs scored between the seventh and 18th innings.Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani also hit two home runs, but the night belonged to first baseman Freeman, who won the Most Valuable Player award as the Dodgers won last year's World Series.Dodgers manager Dave Roberts had apologised earlier on Monday, external after complaining about travel delays while returning from the opening two games in Canada, but was finally able to enjoy home comforts as his side won the first of three games at Dodger Stadium.2005 NL Division Series - Houston Astros 7-6 Atlanta Braves2014 NL Division Series - Washington Nationals 1-2 San Francisco Giants2018 World Series - LA Dodgers 3-2 Boston Red Sox2022 AL Division Series - Seattle Mariners 0-1 Houston Astros2025: World Series - LA Dodgers 6-5 Toronto Blue Jays*home team listed firstTeoscar Hernandez, who had struck out in all four of his at-bats in game two, opened the scoring for the Dodgers with a home run in the second inning.Ohtani doubled the lead with a solo shot of his own in the third, before the Blue Jays' bats woke up in the top of the fourth inning.A fielding error by second baseman Tommy Edman allowed the Canadians to put two men on base, Alejandro Kirk lifted his second homer of the series over the centre-field fence for a 3-2 lead, before Andres Gimenez's sacrifice fly made it 4-2.Blue Jays starter Max Scherzer became the first man to pitch for four different teams in the World Series, but he departed in the fifth inning and that was the cue for the Dodgers to level the scores.Ohtani's third hit of the night scored Enrique Hernandez, before Freeman drove in Ohtani from second base for 4-4.The pendulum swung back towards Toronto in the seventh when Bo Bichette's line drive to the right field corner allowed Vladimir Guerrero Jr to score from first base, but Ohtani's second homer of the night tied the scores again at 5-5, and the game remained deadlocked after that.Both sides stranded multiple baserunners on several occasions, and neither was able to conjure a run with the bases loaded.Ohtani was intentionally walked, external four times and was caught stealing second base, while Toronto pinch-runner Davis Schneider was thrown out at home plate in the 10th, and veteran Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw made a cameo appearance from the bullpen in his final series before retirement.Eventually, with both sides running out of bench players, Freeman lifted reliever Brendon Little over centre field to win it.The series continues with game four on Tuesday, again at Dodger Stadium, when Ohtani will be the starting pitcher.Game 1: Blue Jays 11-4 DodgersGame 2: Blue Jays 1-5 DodgersGame 3: Dodgers 6-5 Blue JaysGame 4 (in LA): Tuesday, 28 OctoberGame 5 (in LA): Wednesday, 29 OctoberGame 6* (in Toronto): Friday, 31 OctoberGame 7* (in Toronto): Saturday, 1 November*if required.

    "body": "13 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS President Donald Trump has not ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term for the White House, saying he would \"love to do it\". But Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice-president in 2028 - an idea floated by some supporters as a way for him to circumvent the US constitution that bars the president from running for a third term.Speaking to reporters during his trip to Asia, Trump described the idea as \"too cute\" and said it \"wouldn't be right\". It is unclear what method he would use to run again. Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon said that a \"plan\" was in place to secure the 79-year-old president another term. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Japan from Malaysia, Trump said that while he would \"be allowed\" to run again as vice-president, he had no plans to do so.\"I think people wouldn't like that,\" he said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\" Talking about the possibility of a third term, Trump said: \"I haven't really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.\" Additionally, Trump also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\".\"All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they don't,\" he added, referring to Democrats.Can Trump serve a third term as US president?The 22nd amendment of the US constitution bars presidents from seeking a third term. Repealing the amendment would require approval from two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and then ratification by 38 of the 50 state legislatures - a process viewed as highly unlikely.Last week, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon - who remains a vocal supporter - claimed there was a \"plan\" to secure a third term for Trump.\"Trump is going to be president in '28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" Bannon told  The Economist. \"At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is.\" In March, Trump told CNBC he would \"probably not\" run again, though he later said  he was \"not joking\" about the possibility. It is still unclear which Democrats intend to run for the White House in 2028, although several have already expressed an interest. On Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that  he would \"be lying\" if he said he was not giving serious thought to a presidential bid. Former vice-president Kamala Harris also told the BBC she may run again and that she could \"possibly\" be president in the future. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoCherylann Mollan, BBC News and Vishnukant Tiwari, BBC HindiBhopal, Madhya PradeshBBCAarish says he's worried about missing work after losing vision in his left eyeAarish, 15, sits on a hospital bed in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. A pair of dark glasses hides a painful injury in his left eye.His cornea was damaged a week ago when an improvised firecracker device that he bought to celebrate the Diwali festival exploded near his face, causing him to lose vision in one eye. He has undergone emergency surgery and his doctor says only time will tell how much sight he can regain.The teenager, who doesn't go to school, says he's most worried about missing work - his father works as a gardener and Aarish repairs televisions to supplement the family income. Child labour is illegal in India, but millions of children work. Indian law allows children above 14 years to work in some industries which are seen as non-hazardous.Aarish is among hundreds of children and young adults from at least five states across northern India who have suffered serious eye injuries from using the same kind of device - called \"carbide guns\" - during Diwali.The \"carbide gun\", a rudimentary device, using calcium carbide in a plastic pipe, gives dramatic results  - a loud blast that sounds like a gunshot, accompanied by fiery sparks. But the explosion is unpredictable and often delayed - officials told the BBC that many of the injuries occurred when children peeped inside the pipe to check just as the blast happened.The sale and purchase of calcium carbide is regulated in India, but farmers and shopkeepers often use it to artificially ripen fruit. Police officials also say the crude guns are sometimes used to scare away animals from fields.But many in India had not heard of these guns until last week, when a spate of injuries was reported after Diwali. Officials said these devices began flooding local markets in northern India after viral social media videos showed them being used as firecrackers.Karan, 14, went through surgery at Hamidia Hospital in BhopalMore than 100 cases of carbide gun-related eye injuries have been reported in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal district alone, with at least 15 requiring surgery. Another 100 cases have been reported from three other districts. In Bihar state, 170 cases have been reported, with 40 requiring surgery, says Dr Bibhuti Prassan Sinha, who heads the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology in Patna city. The actual numbers are likely to be higher, he added.Cases have also been reported from the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, as well as capital Delhi. Some states, including Madhya Pradesh, have now banned the use of carbide guns as firecrackers and several sellers have been arrested.Kavitha Kumar, head of ophthalmology at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, says that patients have been coming in with mild, moderate and severe eye injuries.\"In milder cases, skin on the eye and around it has sustained chemical injuries and thermal burns. In moderate cases, chemical particulate matter has caused mild damage to the cornea and in severe cases, there's extensive damage to the cornea, causing temporary vision loss. With surgery, the patient may be able to regain their sight over time,\" she says. Some doctors told the BBC that they were shocked by the severity of the injuries. Dr Aditi Dubey from Hamidia Hospital said that she had never seen chemical injuries caused by Diwali firecrackers and had to research what \"carbide guns\" were.Many patients said that they bought the gun after seeing it on Instagram Reels and YouTube videos. An attractive aspect was the price - at 150-200 rupees ($1.70-$2; £1.28-£1.70) a piece, it was a relatively cheap firecracker that promised to make a big impact.A search for the term \"carbide gun\" on Instagram and YouTube throws up dozens of videos of young people making and using these devices, often accompanied by rap music. Carbide guns began popping up in local markets in the weeks before DiwaliSome accounts have also termed these videos \"science experiments\" with hashtags like \"useful project\" and \"experiment video\".Dr Sinha told the BBC that one of his patients was an engineering student who made the gun at home after watching such videos. He's currently being treated after losing vision in one of his eyes.Calcium carbide is a regulated substance in India - its possession, use and manufacturing are controlled by law because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse.When it comes in contact with water, it produces acetylene gas, which is highly flammable and has damaging properties on health.Under the Calcium Carbide Rules, 1987, a licence is needed for its sale, purchase and storage - but only for quantities above 200kg.A government official in Bhopal who didn't want to be named told the BBC that calcium carbide is still widely used to artificially ripen fruit despite a federal ban as it contains traces of poisonous substances.Alzain and his mother, Afreen, at Hamidia HospitalHarinarayanachari Mishra, Police Commissioner of Bhopal, told the BBC that carbide guns are also used in northern India during wedding festivities and by farmers to drive away monkeys.Dr Partha Biswas, president of the All India Ophthalmological Society, says carbide guns should be banned urgently.\"It's a national problem. And the seriousness of these incidents shouldn't be minimised as mere \"accidents\" that took place during the Diwali festival,\" he says.He adds that there's potential for these guns to be used as firecrackers during other festivals and events, like when India wins a cricket match or during New Year.\"These crude 'carbide bombs' or 'carbide guns' can cause permanent blindness, disfigurement and disability,\" he says, demanding a nationwide crackdown on manufacturers and sellers of the guns as well as more control over the supply chain of calcium carbide.Back at Hamidia Hospital, Alzain, whose left eye was operated on after he lost his vision, sits inside the tight embrace of his mother. The seven-year-old had pestered his uncle to buy the gun after watching videos on YouTube. Alzain's worried mother, Afreen, hasn't left his bedside since he was admitted a week ago.\"I'm scared for his future,\" she says. \"I hope he's able to see again.\"",

    "body": "Two people have been killed in an underground explosion at a mine in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), the first such incident of its kind since 2015.Emergency services were called to the Endeavor mine at Cobar, about 700km (435 miles) northwest of Sydney, in the early hours of Tuesday after reports two people had been critically injured.Police said a man, in his 60s, was confirmed dead at the scene and two women, both in their 20s, were brought to the surface, but one later died. The second woman was airlifted to hospital for minor injuries and shock.Polymetals Resources, which bought the Endeavour mine in 2023, said all operations at the site had been temporarily suspended.It did not say what caused the explosion. The company's executive chairman Dave Sproule said it was \"shocked and saddened by the tragic incident\" and \"our deepest thoughts and condolences go out to the employee's families, friends and colleagues\".Fatalities from mine explosions are rare in Australia, with the most recent death happening in 2015 at a mine in Queensland according to Safe Work Australia.Cobar Mayor Jarrod Marsden said it was an \"absolutely tragic\" situation.\"The most valuable thing to come out of a mine are the miners, and two families don't get to see their loved ones anymore,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\"Cobar is a small mining community, it's very tight-knit, and I'm sure everyone's going to be thinking of their families today.\"A report will be prepared for the coroner and an investigation into the incident will be carried out by the state's workplace safety authority.According to the Endeavour mine's website, it had been operating continuously from 1982 to 2020 and the new owners were in the process of restarting mining activities for silver, zinc and lead metal production this year. The mine includes a 7km (4.3 miles) decline and 300m shaft, the site said.NSW Premier Chris Minns extended his condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the workers who died.\"This is a heartbreaking day for the Cobar community and will be felt across the entire mining industry,\" he said. Safety protocols and procedures have \"greatly improved in mining\", Minns said, but the two deaths were a \"sobering reminder of why we need to always remain vigilant to protect workers\".",

The group has said it is committed to the deal brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, but that it needs help to find remains buried under the rubble left by two years of war.On Monday evening, Hamas's military wing announced that it would hand over to the Red Cross the body of an Israeli hostage which had been recovered earlier in the day.A few hours later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that its troops in Gaza had received a coffin and taken it to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification procedures.On Tuesday afternoon, the Israeli prime minister's office said it was found that \"remains belonging to fallen hostage Ofir Tzarfati – of blessed memory, who was returned from the Gaza Strip in a military operation about two years ago – were returned\".\"This constitutes a clear violation of the agreement by the Hamas terrorist organisation,\" it added. \"Prime Minister Netanyahu will hold a security discussion with the heads of the security establishment to discuss Israel's steps in response to the violations.\"It is understood that different possible responses are being discussed with US mediators.One being considered is said to be expanding the area of Gaza under IDF control, which is demarcated by the so-called \"Yellow Line\".The latest handover came after the Israeli government confirmed it had allowed a member of Hamas into an IDF-controlled territory to help Red Cross and Egyptian personnel search for the remaining dead hostages.\"The Red Cross, the Egyptian technical team, and a Hamas person have been permitted to enter beyond the IDF's Yellow Line position in Gaza under close IDF supervision,\" Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told a briefing on Monday.She also said the Egyptians would bring in more equipment, including \"tractor-type vehicles\".On Sunday, Bedrosian had said they were using two to three excavators and a similar number of lorries to carry out searches.All 20 living Israeli hostages were released soon after the ceasefire took effect on 10 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages previously returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Eleven of the dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.\"Hamas knows where they are located and there is no other option but for them to be released back home,\" Bedrosian said.But Qatar-based Al Jazeera quoted Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem as saying the claim that it knew all the locations were \"false\".Earlier on Monday, a group representing Israeli hostages' families demanded that immediate action be taken to ensure Hamas handed over all the bodies.\"The families urge the government of Israel, the United States administration, and the mediators not to advance to the next phase of the agreement until Hamas fulfils all of its obligations,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.It came after Israeli media cited an Israeli security official as saying that the US wanted to move to the second phase of US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan even if not all the hostages were returned.On Saturday, Hamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said the group was facing \"challenges\" because Israeli forces had \"altered the terrain of Gaza\".\"Moreover, some of those who buried the bodies have been martyred or no longer remember where they buried them,\" he added.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,500 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Rare earths, Nobel nomination and cheers: Trump ends Japan leg of Asia tour2 hours agoAnthony Zurcher,North America correspondent and Shaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentWatch: Trump addresses cheering troops on US carrier in JapanPraise, Nobel nominations and promises of foreign investment in the US - Japan's newly-elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi rolled out the red carpet for Donald Trump on Tuesday.Trump in turn had warm praise for Takaichi, telling her that the US would be there for \"anything you want, any favours you need, anything… to help Japan\".The two leaders signed a deal on rare earth minerals, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations which reiterated the commitment of the two countries to implement deals struck earlier, including the 15% tariff deal negotiated earlier this year.The pageantry and the venue also seemed tailor-made for the US president.A full military guard of honour and band welcomed Trump to the ornate Akasaka Palace, with its vaulted ceilings and gold-encrusted walls not unlike what the president wants in his planned White House ballroom.Over lunch, Trump congratulated Takaichi for becoming Japan's first female prime minister.Notably, according to a White House readout, that lunch was \"American rice and American beef, deliciously made with Japanese ingredients\" - a move that will no doubt have delighted Trump, who has long demanded that Japan buy rice from the US.China controls the rare earths the world buys - can Trump's new deals change that?Takaichi also accompanied Trump aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, where they were greeted by thousands of cheering American troops. Takaichi took the stage and praised what she called the  \"greatest alliance in the world\" and pledged to increase defence spending.Trump has in the past criticised Japan's lack of defence spending. In April this year, he lambasted a security treaty with Japan as being \"one-sided\", saying: \"We pay billions of dollars to defend them, but they don't pay anything.\"Ahead of their meeting on Wednesday, Trump said he was sure that he would have a \"fantastic relationship\" with Takaichi, who had a strong connection with former PM Shinzo Abe, a Trump favourite who was shot dead in 2022.\"She was a great ally and friend of Abe, who was my friend… He was one of the best… I know they were very close, and I think philosophically they were close, which is very good,\" he told reporters while flying over to Japan from Malaysia on Tuesday.Trump is spending a week in Asia. He will leave Japan for South Korea on Wednesday, and is expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping there on Thursday.Getty ImagesDonald Trump met Sanae Takaichi, Japan's new prime minister, on the visitThe meeting with Trump was seen as a critical early test for Takaichi, who was elected as prime minister by Japanese lawmakers earlier this month.Both countries have long been allies, but navigating a relationship with a fickle Trump, who has in the past appeared to waver in his commitment to Japan, lies at the core of the country's foreign policy.On Wednesday, Takaichi described Trump as a \"partner in a new golden era\", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East. She announced that Japan would be nominating him for the Nobel peace prize.She also presented Trump with a collection of golf-related gifts, according to Trump's assistant Margo Martin.These included a golf bag signed by Hideki Matsuyama, the first male Japanese golfer to win a major golf championship, as well as a putter used by Abe. They also signed two caps printed with the words: Japan is back.In turn, Trump described her as a \"close friend\" and described the US alliance with Japan as a \"beautiful friendship\" that was \"born out of the ashes of a terrible war\". He also announced he had approved the first delivery of long-awaited US missiles for F-35 fighter jets to Japan, which would take place this week.Pleasantries have set a positive tone to the meetings so far,  but behind the smiles and the pagentary, there is real pressure on Japan.During the working lunch, Takaichi presented Trump with a map showing the investments that Japanese companies have made in the US. And during his speech on the USS George Washington, Trump said Takaichi had told him earlier about plans for Toyota to put $10bn (£7.5bn) into building plants \"all over\" the US.But Trump also wants more access to Japan's markets - not just getting them to buy more rice, but also soybeans, and to open its market to US vehicles.Getty ImagesThe US president was hosted in the ornate Akasaka PalaceBut Takaichi also needs to protect domestic industries and doesn't want to anger crucial interest groups at home, like the powerful farming lobby.Tokyo is heavily reliant on exports, and cannot afford a tariff fight especially when it comes to its auto industry. Automakers - the country's largest exporters to the US - faced 24% tariffs and tens of billions of dollars in losses.Tariffs have now been lowered to 15%, in step with rivals in the region such as South Korea.Tomohiko Taniguchi - former special adviser to  Abe - said there were things that Takaichi could draw on from Trump's relationship with her late mentor. He said it was important for Takaichi to be \"straightforward and say bluntly what Japan's national interests are, and to see where those two nations national interests overlap, and always mindful that Japan's safety must be in hands of the Japanese\".But Takaichi won't just have to balance Japan's interests and its alliance with the US – she'll also have to do that while maintaining the country's crucial trade partnership with China.Rintaro Nishimura senior associate at the Asia Group said: \"Takaichi will have to walk a very fine line, maybe tone down some of her more hawkish tendencies on China... but also assure Trump that the US-Japan relationship is the most important.\"",

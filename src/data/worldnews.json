    "body": "<div><div><p>2 days ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Shaimaa Khalil</span><span>Japan correspondent, Tokyo</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>Japan's ruling conservative party has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning the 64-year-old to be Japan's first female prime minister. </p><p>Takaichi is among the more conservative candidates leaning to the ruling party's right. A former government minister, TV host and avid heavy metal drummer, she is one of the best-known figures in Japanese politics - and a controversial one at that.</p><p>She faces many challenges, including contending with a sluggish economy and households struggling with relentless inflation and stagnant wages. </p><p>She will also have to navigate a rocky US-Japan relationship and see through a tariff deal with the Trump administration agreed by the previous government.</p></div><div><p>If confirmed as prime minister, one of Takaichi's key challenges will be uniting the party after a turbulent few years which saw it rocked by scandals and internal conflicts. </p><p>Last month, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose term lasted just over a year, announced he would step down after a series of election defeats that saw the  Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) governing coalition lose its majority in both chambers of parliament.</p><p>Prof Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo, told the BBC that Takaichi was unlikely to have \"much success at healing the internal party rift\".</p><p>Takaichi belongs to the \"hardline\" faction of the LDP, which believed that \"the reason the LDP support has imploded is because it lost touch with its right-wing DNA\", he added.</p><p>\"I think she's in a good position to regain the right wing voters, but at the expense of wider popular appeal, if they go into a national election.\"</p><p>Takaichi has been a long-time admirer of Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. She is now ever closer to fulfilling her Iron Lady ambition. </p><p>But many women voters don't see her as an advocate for progress. </p><p>\"She calls herself Japan's Margaret Thatcher. In terms of fiscal discipline, she's anything but Thatcher,\" Prof Kingston said.</p><p>\"But like Thatcher she's not much of a healer. I don't think she's done much to empower women.\"</p><p>Takaichi is a staunch conservative who's long opposed legislation allowing women to keep their maiden names after marriage, saying it is against tradition. She is also against same sex marriage. </p><p>A protégé of the late former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has vowed to bring back his economic vision, known as Abenomics – which involves high fiscal spending and cheap borrowing. </p><p>The LDP veteran is hawkish on security and aims to revise Japan's pacifist constitution. </p><p>She's also a regular visitor of the controversial Yasukuni shrine where Japan's war dead including some convicted war criminals are memorialised.</p><p>She will likely be confirmed by parliament, although not automatically like her predecessors because the ruling party is in a much weaker position now having lost its majority in both houses.</p></div>",

The two already sit in the same European Parliament group – the \"pro-sovereignty\" Patriots for Europe, which Babis founded alongside Hungary's Viktor Orban and Austria's Herbert Kickl last year.</p><p>ANO shares the Motorists' misgivings about the EU's emissions targets, and vows to modify or reject them outright.</p><p>Both parties are firmly against Czech households carrying a greater financial burden for cleaner energy, and both oppose the EU's ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars after 2035.</p><p>Relations with the SPD could be more fraught.</p><p>For a start, SPD fought this election in a formal alliance with a number of fringe parties on the far-right, meaning they will have to yield some of their seats to them. Okamura may not have full control of the MPs in his caucus – always a recipe for disaster in coalition politics.</p><p>Babis has also categorically ruled out allowing a referendum on either EU or NATO membership – a key policy priority for the SPD.</p><p>The ANO leader might have leaned heavily into anti-Ukrainian rhetoric in the final days of the campaign, lambasting the centre-right government for giving \"Czech mothers nothing, and Ukrainians everything\".</p><p>But Okamura's call for Ukrainian refugees to be deported en masse will likely fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Czech military support for Ukraine's war effort however is likely to change significantly under a Babis administration.</p></div><div><p>He has already vowed to scrap the successful Czech ammunition initiative – which has delivered 3.5 million shells to Ukraine since 2022.</p><p>Babis claims it lacks transparency, but Czech government officials who created the scheme say it works precisely because it is not transparent.</p><p>Under the initiative, Czech arms dealers use their international contacts to procure shells for Ukraine on the global market, with the bulk of the money coming from EU and NATO partners. Some of the producers are in countries that have relationships with Russia but as the deal is arranged with Czech dealers their involvement remains private.</p><p>The ANO leader wants it moved under the umbrella of NATO instead, and again on Saturday accused Czech arms dealers of making enormous profits from the scheme.</p><p>However, he said he would have no problem negotiating the matter with President Zelensky.</p><p>Babis also laughed off claims Western allies were worried the Czech Republic would no longer be a reliable partner in the EU and NATO under his administration, and that was why he now appeared to be distancing himself from extremist parties.</p><p>\"Your problem is you just copy lies from Czech journalists,\" he replied, answering a reporter from the New York Times in English.</p><p>\"I spoke with Trump five times! I was in the Pentagon. I was in the FBI. I talked to the head of the CIA,\" Babis said, speaking of his first term, which overlapped with President Trump's first term in office.</p><p>\"We were a very reliable partner,\" he went on.</p><p>\"I have been prime minister. We have been in government before. And we had excellent results.\"</p></div></article>",

    "body": "<div><p>Democratic and Republican leaders remain far apart on how to end the partial shutdown of the US government as another day of voting approaches on Monday.</p><p>In separate Sunday interviews with NBC's Meet the Press, the House's top Democrat Hakeem Jeffries and its Republican leader Mike Johnson each blamed the other's party for the continued standoff, which will head to day five on Monday. </p><p>The key dividing issue has been healthcare. Democrats want to ensure health insurance subsidies for those with low-income do not expire and aim to reverse cuts to the Medicaid health programme.</p><p>A bill to fund the government has passed the House, but has repeatedly failed in the Senate. </p></div><div><p>Jeffries accused Republicans of \"lying\" about Democrats' intentions in the negotiations \"because they're losing the court of public opinion\". But Johnson said Democrats are \"not serious\" and negotiating in bad faith - \"they're doing this to get political cover\".</p><p>The Senate is expected to reconvene Monday afternoon and once again take up a pair of continuing resolutions to fund the government. Meanwhile, House Democrats will meet Monday to discuss the situation. Johnson has extended a House recess through the week, meaning Congress' lower chamber will not be in session to take up a funding bill should the Senate make any changes and come to a deal. </p><p>Republicans hold a narrow majority of 53 seats in the 100-seat Senate, but any funding measure will require 60 votes to pass. </p><p>In his interview with NBC, Johnson argued that Democrats' refusal to approve a short-term spending bill that kept funding at current levels was unnecessary. The healthcare tax credits at issue don't expire until the end of the year, he said, and a Democratic proposal would add too much new spending in a seven-week stopgap measure. </p><p>\"We have plenty of time to figure that out,\" he said.</p><p>He also argued that the tax credits would not help address what he says are major problems with healthcare policy, including \"illegal aliens and able-bodied young men without dependents\" using Medicaid.</p><p>Some Republicans, including Vice-President JD Vance, have cast the Democrats' position as \"trying to give healthcare benefits to illegal aliens\". Democrats have denied those claims and illegal or undocumented immigrants are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vzyl5x15ro\">not eligible for the schemes</a> the Democrats are supporting, BBC Verify reports.</p><p>Jeffries told NBC's Kristen Welker that Democrats feel the consequences of the expiring credits are dire. </p><p>\"We are standing up for the healthcare of hard-working American taxpayers,\" he said. \"If Republicans continue to refuse to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credit, tens of millions of American taxpayers are going to experience dramatically increased premiums, copays, and deductibles.\"</p><p>Jeffries criticised President Donald Trump's handling of the shutdown and his social media posts aimed at Democrats, saying \"that behavior is outrageous\". \"We need serious leadership,\" he said. </p><p>Jeffries added that Republican leaders have stopped communicating with Democrats and accused them of negotiating in bad faith. </p><p>\"As Democrats, our view is that we will find bipartisan common ground with our Republican colleagues to reopen the government, to actually pass a spending bill that meets the needs of the American people,\" Jeffries said. \"But we have to decisively address this Republican health care crisis that is devastating hard-working American taxpayers.\"</p></div><div><p>New polling data from CBS, the BBC's American news partner, has found that Americans view both parties' handling of the shutdown unfavourably, with President Trump also netting a negative reception. </p><p>The survey found that 80% of the nearly 2,500 Americans polled are very or somewhat concerned about the shutdown's effect on the economy. Only 23% of those surveyed said the Republican position was worth a shutdown, while 28% said the same of Democrats' argument. </p><p>The polling found voters blame Trump and Republicans in Congress most for the situation, at 39%, but Democrats were not far behind at 30%. About 31% of Americans polled said both sides were to blame.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the consequences of the shutdown are beginning to mount as the shutdown drags into its second week. On Saturday, The National Gallery of Art announced it had to close its doors due to lack of funding. </p><p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to use the shutdown to enact mass layoffs across the federal government and cut agencies and services that he says are important to Democrats. </p><p>The details of those potential cuts have not been made public. The president has argued it is a chance \"to clear out dead wood, waste, and fraud. Billions of Dollars can be saved\". </p><p>Johnson was asked about the threats in the Sunday interview, telling NBC that he had not seen details, but \"it is a regrettable situation that the president does not want\".</p><p>\"I want Chuck Schumer to do the right thing that he's done throughout his 30-plus year career in Congress and vote to keep the government open,\" Johnson said, adding that as long as the government was stalled, the White House has \"to make tough decisions\".</p></div>",

Hybrid sales have jumped by a factor of three.</p><p>Battery-powered cars accounted for 10% of overall sales in August - a new high, according to S&P Global Mobility. </p><p>And in updates to investors this week, General Motors, Ford, Tesla and other companies all reported record electric sales over the past three months.</p><p>This marked a bright spot in an industry wrestling with the fallout from still high interest rates and buyers on edge over inflation, tariffs and the wider economy. </p></div><div><p>But analysts say the boom was caused by a dash to buy before the end of a government subsidy that helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,588) off the price<b> </b>of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles. </p><p>With that tax credit gone as of the end of September, carmakers are expecting momentum to shift into reverse. </p><p>\"It's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,\" Ford chief executive Jim Farley said at an event on Tuesday.</p><p>\"I expect that EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously,\" the chief financial officer of General Motors, Paul Jacobson, said at a conference last month, adding it would take time to see how quickly buyers would come back.</p></div><div><p>Even with the recent gains, the US, the world's second biggest car market, stood out as a laggard in electric car sales compared to much of the rest of the world. </p><p>In the UK, for example, sales of battery electric and hybrid cars made up nearly 30% of new sales last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyd094168go\">Latest industry figures suggest that number is even higher.</a></p><p>In Europe, they accounted for roughly one in five sales, while in China, the world's biggest car market, sales of such cars accounted for almost half of overall sales last year, according to the IEA, and they are expected to become the majority this year.</p><p>Take-up in some other countries, like Norway and Nepal, is even greater. </p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) tend to account for a smaller share of sales in Latin America, Africa and other parts of Asia - but growth there has been surging. </p></div><p></p><h2>Policy differences</h2><p></p><div><p>Analysts say adoption in the US has been slowed by comparatively weak government support for the sector, which has limited the kinds of subsidies, trade-in programmes and rules that have helped the industry in places such as China, the UK and Europe.  </p><p>Former President Joe Biden pushed hard to increase take-up, aiming<b> </b>for electric cars to account for half of all sales in the US by 2030.</p><p>His administration tightened rules on emissions, boosted demand through purchases for government fleets, nudged carmakers to invest with loans and grants for EV investments, spent billions building charging stations and expanded the $7,500 tax credit as a sweetener for buyers.</p><p>Supporters cast those efforts in part as a competitive imperative, warning that without these US carmakers would risk losing out to competitors from China and other countries.</p><p>But President Donald Trump, who recently called climate change a \"con job\", has pushed to scrap many of those measures, including the $7,500 credit, arguing that they were pushing people to buy cars they would not otherwise want. </p><p>\"We're saying ... you're not going to be forced to make all of those cars,\" he said this summer, while signing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq4wxd583o\">a bill aimed at striking down</a> rules from California, which would have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62683260\">phased out sales of petrol-only cars</a> in the state by 2035. \"You can make them, but it'll be by the market, judged by the market.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images A row of BYD Dolphin compact hatchback electric vehicles illuminated by fluorescent lights at a manufacturing plant\" /><span>Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><div><p>Electric cars have become more affordable in the US in recent years - but they still cost more than comparable petrol-powered vehicles. </p><p>And Chinese carmakers like BYD, which have made rapid inroads in other markets thanks to low prices, have been effectively shut out of the US, due to high tariffs targeting cars made in China, backed by both Biden and Trump. </p><p>As of August, the average transaction price of an electric car in the US was more than $57,000, according to auto industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, about 16% higher than the average for all cars.</p><p>The least expensive battery car on offer, a Nissan Leaf, costs about $30,000 (£22,000). By comparison, several models can be found for under £20,000 in the UK.    </p></div><div><p>Analysts say what buyers do next hinges on how carmakers set prices in the months ahead, as they contend not only with the end of the tax credit but also tariffs on foreign cars and certain car parts that Trump introduced this spring. </p><p>Hyundai said this week it would offset the loss of the tax credit by lowering the price for its range of Ioniq EVs. But Tesla said the cost for monthly lease payments of some of its cars would rise. </p><p>Stephanie Brinley, associate director of S&P Global Mobility, said she did not expect to see many firms follow Hyundai's example, given the pressures from tariffs. </p><p>While some buyers may opt for EVs anyway, \"next year is going to be hard,\" she warned, noting that her firm is calling for overall car sales to fall by roughly 2% in 2026.  </p><p>\"It would have been difficult enough if all you had to deal with is new tariffs, but with new tariffs and the incentive going away, there's two impacts.\"</p></div><div><p>Carmakers had already been scaling back their investments in electric cars.</p><p>Researchers say Trump's policy changes could reduce those investments even more.</p><p>\"It's a big hit to the EV industry - there's no tiptoeing around it,\" said Katherine Yusko, research analyst at the American Security Project</p><p>\"The subsidies were initially a way to level the playing field and now that they're gone the US has a lot of ground to make up.\"</p><p>However Ms Brinley said she was hesitant to declare the US behind in an industry still testing out technology alternatives. </p><p>\"Is [electric] really the right thing?\" she said. \"Saying that we're behind assumes that this is the only and best solution and I think it's a little early to say that.\"</p></div></article>",

Leavitt said that most of those cuts would come from agencies that \"do not align with this administration's values of putting our country first\". </p><p>As part of the federal government's response to the shut down, Vought on Friday announced the suspension of $2.1bn in federal infrastructure funding for Chicago, in addition to the previous freezing of $18bn in infrastructure spending in New York City and the cancellation of approximately $8bn in funding for federal energy projects in some Democratic-run states. </p><p>On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democrats are fighting the healthcare issue because \"we know Americans want this\". </p><p>\"And we know many of my Republican colleagues want this as well,\" he said. \"But failure to act would be devastating, and Republicans know it.\" </p><p>Some Democrats - including Connecticut Senator Richard Bluementhal and Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman - said they want to hear directly from the president about the ongoing stalemate. </p><p>Citing a bipartisan border bill that the president ultimately rejected last year, they said they fear that any negotiations with Senate Republicans could ultimately be contradicted by Trump. </p><p>Early polls have suggested that Americans are deeply split on the shutdown, with one Washington Post poll conducted on 1 October finding that 47% of US adults blame Republicans, compared to 30% who blame Democrats. </p><p>Another 23% said they were unsure.</p><p><i>(With additional reporting from Cai Pigliucci on Capitol Hill)</i></p></div>",

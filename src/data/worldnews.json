    "body": "7 hours agoTom McArthurReutersAt least 37 people were killed and dozens injured in Peru when a bus plunged into a 200m (650ft) deep ravine after a head-on collision.The incident happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning on a \"rugged\" stretch of the Pan-American Highway that connects Peru with Chile in the country's southern region of Arequipa.Local media say the bus was carrying 60 passengers when it smashed into a pickup truck on a curve, careered off the road and fell down to the banks of the Ocoña River. Bus crashes are common in Peru, especially at night and on mountain highways. This is often due to poor road conditions, excessive speed, and lack of safety signage.The bus, operated by the Llamosas company, was heading from Chala, a town in Caraveli province, to Arequipa. Both drivers reportedly survived the crash, which happened at kilometre 780 of the Pan-American Highway South.Pictures from the scene of the crash show the wrecked bus at the bottom of a steep ravine - its windows completely shattered, bodywork badly damaged and roof caved in.Waldor Llerena, Ocona's district mayor, told radio station RPP that the terrain around the crash site is \"very rugged\", and the area had a history of similar deadly accidents. Public Prosecutor's OfficePolice experts will work out the cause of the crash, officials saidThirty-six people died at the scene and another person later died in hospital, Walther Oporto, Arequipa's regional health chief told local media, citing firefighters at the scene of the crash.Health officials told RPP that 25 people - including three minors - are being treated in a local hospital for their injuries.An investigation into the incident is underway and the driver of the pickup truck has been detained, the Public Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.In 2022, more than 3,300 people died in traffic accidents in Peru, official figures suggest.Stretching from Alaska to the pencil tip of Argentina, the 48,000km-long Pan-American Highway holds the record for the world's longest road navigable by motor  vehicle.",

    "body": "4 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesA deadly car blast in a busy area of India's capital city Delhi was a \"terror incident\", the country's government has said.At least eight people were killed and 20 more injured in the explosion near the city's historic Red Fort on Monday.Prime minister Narendra Modi's cabinet condemned the attack at a security meeting late on Wednesday, saying it was a cowardly act carried out by anti-national forces.Authorities have not yet named anyone or made any arrests in connection with the explosion.In Wednesday's resolution, the cabinet said: \"The country has witnessed a heinous terror incident, perpetrated by anti-national forces, through a car explosion.\"The cabinet directs that the investigation into the incident be pursued with the utmost urgency and professionalism so that the perpetrators, their collaborators, and their sponsors are identified and brought to justice without delay.\"The cabinet also said it \"unequivocally condemns this dastardly and cowardly act that has led to the loss of innocent lives\".India has an \"unwavering commitment\" to a zero tolerance policy towards terrorism, it added.The explosion happened near a metro station close to the Red Fort, one of Delhi's most high-profile landmarks.Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters the incident happened at around 18:52 local time (13:52 GMT), when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light before it exploded, damaging nearby vehicles.A police spokesperson told the BBC that the explosion came from a Hyundai i20 car that was moving and carrying three people at the time, a police spokesman told the BBC. As news of the explosion broke, Delhi police declared a high alert, with neighbouring states quickly following suit, including the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which is home to famous sites like the Taj Mahal and is a densely populated region.Police, forensic experts, and security teams are investigating the explosion, a minister said on Monday after the incident.\"We are exploring all possibilities and will conduct a thorough investigation, taking all possibilities into account. All options will be investigated immediately and we will present the results to the public,\" home minister Amit Shah said.Modi sent his condolences to those who lost loved ones in the blast. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said the news was \"extremely heartbreaking\".The Red Fort was built in the the 17th Century and is visited by thousands of tourists daily. Indian prime ministers give their annual Independence Day speeches at the site.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesA Danish man has been convicted of sharing nude scenes from copyrighted films and TV series on the social media site Reddit.According to a police document seen by BBC News, the man - who is not named in the document - shared 347 clips of nude scenes on the Reddit group he moderated, which were then viewed 4.2 million times. The Danish police say he has been given a seven month suspended sentence for copyright infringement.Experts say the man was prosecuted under a rarely-used clause in Danish copyright law, with the judge finding that by taking the scenes out of their original context, the man had damaged the artists' \"moral rights\". He has also been convicted of sharing more than 25 terabytes of copyrighted data.From March 2022 to May 2023, the man known as \"KlammereFyr\" on Reddit posted sexually explicit scenes featuring over 100 actresses.He shared them in the subreddit - or forum - he was a moderator of.According to the Danish anti-piracy group The Rights Alliance (TRA), his subreddit had more than 6,000 members and users were encouraged to request for clips of specific actors.In 2023, campaigners reported the case to the police on behalf of the affected actors, directors and producers, which led to the subreddit being closed down.Andrea Vagn Jensen, one of the actresses whose explicit scenes were shared in the group, told the Danish broadcaster DR at the time she felt there was a difference between appearing naked in a film and appearing on Reddit.The actress said the posts amounted to \"abuse\".'An important signal'The man was arrested in September 2024 and pleaded guilty to the charges last month.In a statement following the verdict, TRA head Maria Fredenslund said the ruling sent an \"important\" signal \"that violations of artists' rights has consequences\".The ruling is considered unique in Denmark for its use of the \"moral rights\" section of the Danish Copyright Act, which states an artist's work cannot be used in a way which infringes upon their reputation.Copyright law expert Dr Alina Trapova told the BBC the case was \"rare\" for its focus on the damage to the integrity of an artist, rather than to them economically.How the case could affect other countries is unclear.But she said there may be \"more and more of these actions\" in the future with the growth of artificial intelligence, where \"the integrity of one's work might be tempered with much more easily\".",

    "body": "Ukraine's energy and justice ministers have resigned in the wake of a major investigation into corruption in the country's energy sector.President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko's removal on Wednesday. On Monday anti-corruption bodies accused several people of orchestrating a embezzlement scheme in the energy sector worth about $100m (£76m), including at the national nuclear operator Enerhoatom.Some of those implicated in the scandal are - or have been - close associates of Zelensky's.The allegation is that Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and other key ministers and officials received payments from contractors building fortifications against Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Among those alleged to be involved are former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95. He has since reportedly fled the country. Halushchenko said he would defend himself against the accusations, while Grynchuk said on social media: \"Within the scope of my professional activities there were no violations of the law.\"The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the investigation - which was 15 months in the making and involved 1,000 hours of audio recordings - uncovered the participation of several members of the Ukrainian government. According to Nabu, the people involved systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.Prosecutors alleged that the scheme's proceeds were laundered through an office in Kyiv linked to the family of former Ukrainian lawmaker and current Russian senator Andriy Derkach.Nabu has been releasing new snippets of its investigation and wiretaps every day and on Tuesday it promised more would come.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants. It will also shine a spotlight on corruption in Ukraine, which continues to be endemic despite work by Nabu and Sap in the 10 years since they were created. In July, nationwide protests broke out over changes curbing the independence of Nabu and Sap. Ukrainians feared the nation could lose the coveted status of EU candidate country which it was granted on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption. Kyiv's European partners also expressed severe alarm at the decision, with ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressing the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.The backlash was the most severe to hit the Ukrainian government since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 and was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate the freedom of the two anti-corruption bodies.Yet for some that crisis brought into question Zelensky's dedication to anti-corruption reforms. The latest scandal threatens to lead to more awkward questions for the Ukrainian president. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterAFP via Getty ImagesPennies, which are worth one cent, cost nearly four cents to make.The US is set to make its final penny.The Philadelphia Mint will strike its last batch of one-cent coins on Wednesday, after more than 230 years of production.The coins will remain in circulation but the phase-out has already prompted businesses to start adjusting prices, as they say pennies are becoming harder to find.The government says the move will save money, or as President Donald Trump put it in February when he first announced the plans: \"Rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time\".Pennies, which honour Civil War president Abraham Lincoln and are made of copper-plated zinc, today cost nearly four cents each to make — more than twice the cost of a decade ago, according to the Treasury Department. It estimates the decision to end production will save about $56m a year.Officials have argued that the rise of electronic transactions is making the penny, which first went into production in 1793, increasingly moot. The Treasury Department estimates that about 300 billion of the coins will remain in circulation, \"far exceeding the amount needed for commerce\".Many pennies end up falling out of use. About 60% of all coins in circulation in the US - or about $60-$90 for the typical household - sits stashed at home in piggy banks, deemed not worth trading in, according to a 2022 government analysis.But penny-pinchers beware: as businesses start rounding up prices, the move is expected to raise costs for shoppers. One study by researchers at the Richmond Federal Reserve estimated that could cost consumers $6m annually.Other countries have also phased out their lowest value coins. Canada, for example, made its last batch of one cent coins in 2012.Australia and New Zealand retired one and two cent coins in the 1990s, and New Zealand stopped production of five cent coins in 2006.The UK floated a plan to scrap 1p coins in 2018, though the proposal was later withdrawn. But the rise of electronic transactions did prompt the UK to halt production of coins in 2024, after officials decided there were sufficient 1p and 2p coins in circulation.In the US attention has now turned to the nickel, which has a face value of five cents but costs nearly 14 cents to produce. Retiring that coin would have a far bigger impact on shoppers, costing consumers some $55m per year, according to the Richmond Fed study.",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 16 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAlmost a year to the day since French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal was arrested on arrival at Algiers airport, the Algerian presidency has granted him a pardon and allowed him to leave the country.Sansal, 81, has been at the centre of a bitter diplomatic row between Paris and Algiers and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune's decision came in response to a direct approach from German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.The writer arrived in Germany on a military plane on Wednesday evening. French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Sansal by phone, said France had used respect and calm to bring about his freedom.\"I thank President Tebboune for this act of humanity,\" said Macron.Although Paris had for months sought to lower tensions with Algeria, it was the German president's role that secured Sansal's release because of his good relations with Algeria's leader.Élysée Palace sources told French media that Frank-Walter Steinmeier had acted as a \"trusted third party\" rather than just a mediator.Steinmeier said this week he had asked President Tebboune to pardon Sansal, \"given his advanced age and fragile health\", so the writer could receive medical treatment in Germany.Tebboune said on Wednesday he had decided to respond favourably to Steinmeier's request \"because of its nature and humanitarian motives\". Sansal is being treated for prostate cancer.He was given a five-year jail sentence in July for undermining national unity with remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.The novelist has long been a critic of Algeria's government, which had not responded favourably to France's appeal for clemency.Relations had already been on the slide after President Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.The spat worsened in April when Algeria expressed outrage after one of its consular staff in France was arrested over the kidnapping of a government critic in Paris.The crisis between the two countries was seen as unprecedented in more than 60 years since Algeria secured independence from France in 1962.Some French commentators and political figures blamed what was seen as a confrontational stance to Algeria taken by right-wing former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau and others on the right of French politics.Algerian minister Sofiane Chaib also blamed Retailleau earlier this year for the \"fabricated spat\".Then at the end of last month a motion by France's National Rally was narrowly passed by MPs opposing a 1968 Franco-Algerian migration accord that granted residency rights to Algerians.Although the move was seen as a potential setback, the decision to replace Retailleau with Laurent Nuñez as interior minister appeared to signal a new mood.\"He has completely changed the way relations with [Algeria] are handled\", ex-diplomat Jean-Christophe Ruffin told French radio.Retailleau responded to Sansal's release on Wednesday speaking of \"immense relief and great joy\".Tensions between the two countries remain, though, after French sportswriter Christophe Gleizes was jailed for seven years in July for allegedly trying to interview a member of a movement designed by Algeria as a terrorist group.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot praised diplomats for their work in securing Sansal's release, and said they remained focused on Gleizes, \"whose imminent release we are hoping for\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlineAt least 19 people have been killed in an air strike on a suspected rebel camp in Colombian province of Guaviare, according to the country's military. The attack targeted a dissident faction of the Farc rebel group, which engages in drug trafficking.Colombia's left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, had in the past been reluctant to use air strikes to hit rebel camps but following the breakdown of peace talks with several of Colombia's armed groups, he gave the green light for the military offensive. The air strike comes after the Trump administration accused Petro of allowing the drugs trade to expand, which the Colombian president has denied. Colombian Defence Minister Pedro Sánchez said that President Petro had authorised the air strike after learning of \"the imminent threat [the group] posed to the population and the security forces\".Sánchez said that the camp belonged to members of a dissident group led by a commander known by the alias of Iván Mordisco.Mordisco once formed part of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) but broke away from the rebel group as it negotiated a peace deal with the government, which he did not support. He is considered to be the most powerful dissident rebel leader in Colombia, whose group engages in illegal mining and extortion as well as drug trafficking. Defence Minister Sánchez described Mordisco as \"one of the most dangerous criminals and drug traffickers\" in the country. During the military operation, the security forces also detained three people and freed three children who had been recruited by the group. The forced recruitment of children by armed groups has been on the rise in recent years in Colombia according to rights groups, which have documented how children as young as nine are kidnapped, or lured away from their parents with false promises. After Petro, Colombia's first left-wing president, was sworn in, he opened peace talks with a number of armed groups in an attempt to make good on his campaign promise to bring \"total peace\" to the country.Mordisco's group was one of those that entered into talks, but they broke down  after six months when Mordisco led a walk-out. The government blames the group for a deadly explosive attack on a military facility in the city of Cali in August.Following that explosion, Petro described Mordisco as \"a drug trafficker disguised as a revolutionary\".Petro is under pressure by the United States to combat drug trafficking.Colombia is the world's biggest producer of cocaine and the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says Petro \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity\".Last month, the US government imposed financial sanctions on the Colombian president. Petro in turn has accused the United States government of \"murder\" over the US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific allegedly carrying drugs. On Tuesday, he again expressed his opposition to the US strikes - in which at least 76 people have been killed - and ordered his government to suspend intelligence sharing with US security agencies.In his post on X, he said that \"the fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoDavid Gritten and Sebastian Usher,JerusalemReutersDonald Trump has repeatedly asked for a pardon for his close ally Benjamin NetanyahuIsrael's President Isaac Herzog has received a letter from US President Donald Trump formally urging him to \"fully pardon\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Netanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He has denied any wrongdoing.In the letter, Trump writes that he \"absolutely\" respects the independence of Israel's justice system, but that he believes Netanyahu is facing \"a political, unjustified prosecution\".Herzog's office said he held Trump \"in the highest regard\", but that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.Netanyahu later thanked Trump for the \"incredible support\".\"As usual, you get right to the point and call it like it is,\" he wrote on X. \"I look forward to continuing our partnership to bolster security and expand peace.\"In 2020, Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial.In the first case, prosecutors have alleged that he received gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours.He is accused in the second case of offering to help improve the circulation of an Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverage.And in the third, prosecutors have alleged that he promoted regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder of an Israeli telecoms company in exchange for positive coverage by a news website.Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch-hunt\" by political opponents.Last month, after helping to broker the ceasefire in Israel's two-year with Hamas in Gaza, Trump said Herzog should pardon his close ally in a seemingly off-the-cuff remark during a speech to the Israeli parliament.\"Cigars and Champagne, who the hell cares about that?\" he asked.In his letter to the president, Trump writes: \"As the Great State of Israel and the amazing Jewish People move past the terribly difficult times of the last three years, I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister, and is now leading Israel into a time of peace.\"He adds: \"While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that this 'case' against Bibi [Netanyahu], who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political, unjustified prosecution.\"The response from Herzog's office is diplomatic, saying that he \"holds President Trump in the highest regard and continues to express his deep appreciation for President Trump's unwavering support for Israel\".It also politely points out that \"anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures\".According to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute their sentence\".However, the High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president could pardon an individual before they are convicted, if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.A pardon would also need to be requested by the accused or a close relative.There has been no public indication of this so far, although there is speculation in the Israeli media that this could happen.Israel GPOIsrael's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, urged Herzog to \"listen to President Trump\", saying Netanyahu's trial had \"become an indictment against the prosecution itself, whose carelessness and crimes are revealed in court every day\".However, Israel's opposition leader and former prime minister, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: \"Reminder: Israeli law stipulates that the first condition for receiving a pardon is an admission of guilt and an expression of remorse.\"He later told Israel's parliament: \"There comes a moment when people must tell themselves... we must also say 'no' to an American president. We are a sovereign country; there's a limit to interference.\"For Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters, a pardon has long been sought since his trial began.But for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.It was fears that this was under attack with the government's plans for judicial reforms that brought hundreds of thousands out onto the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 that triggered the Gaza war.",

    "body": "5 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Eastern and Southern Europe correspondent and Guy Delauney,Balkans correspondentAP Photo/Jerome DelayCivilians risked their lives to cross Sarajevo's main boulevard during the Bosnian warThe public prosecutor's office in Milan has opened an investigation into claims that Italian citizens travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina on \"sniper safaris\" during the war in the early 1990s.Italians and others are alleged to have paid large sums to shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo.The Milan complaint was filed by journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni, who describes a \"manhunt\" by \"very wealthy people\" with a passion for weapons who \"paid to be able to kill defenceless civilians\" from Serb positions in the hills around Sarajevo.Different rates were charged to kill men, women or children, according to some reports.More than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo.Yugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.Similar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years, but the evidence gathered by Gavazzeni, which includes the testimony of a Bosnian military intelligence officer, is now being examined by Italian counter terrorism prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis.The charge is murder.CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFPMore than 11,000 civilians died in the three-year siege of SarajevoThe Bosnian officer apparently revealed that his Bosnian colleagues found out about the so-called safaris in late 1993 and then passed on the information to Italy's Sismi military intelligence in early 1994.The response from Sismi came a couple of months later, he said. They found out that \"safari\" tourists would fly from the northern Italian border city of Trieste and then travel to the hills above Sarajevo.\"We've put a stop to it and there won't be any more safaris,\" the officer was told, according to Ansa news agency. Within two to three months the trips had stopped.Ezio Gavazzeni, who usually writes about terrorism and the mafia, first read about the sniper tours to Sarajevo three decades ago when Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the story, but without firm evidence.He returned to the topic after seeing \"Sarajevo Safari\", a documentary film from 2022 by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic which alleges that those involved in the killings came from several countries, including the US and Russia as well as Italy.Gavazzeni began to dig further and in February handed prosecutors his findings, said to amount to a 17-page file including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic.MICHAEL EVSTAFIEV/AFPSnipers would shoot at civilians from areas controlled by the Bosnian Serbs overlooking SarajevoAn investigation in Bosnia itself appears to have stalled.Speaking to Italy's La Repubblica newspaper, Gavazzeni alleges that \"many\" took part in the practice, \"at least a hundred\" in all, with Italians paying \"a lot of money\" to do so, up to €100,000 (£88,000) in today's terms.In 1992, late Russian nationalist writer and politician Eduard Limonov was filmed firing multiple rounds into Sarajevo from a heavy machine gun. He was being given a tour of hillside positions by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was later convicted of genocide by an international tribunal in the Hague. Limonov didn't pay for his war tourism, though. He was there as an admirer of Karadzic, telling him: \"We Russians should take example from you.\"Italian prosecutors and police are said to have identified a list of witnesses as they try to establish who might have been involved.However, members of the British forces who served in Sarajevo in the 1990s have told the BBC that they never heard of any so-called \"sniper tourism\" during  the Bosnian conflict.They indicated that any attempts to bring in people from third countries who had paid to shoot at civilians in Sarajevo would have been \"logistically difficult to accomplish\", due to the proliferation of checkpoints.British forces served both inside Sarajevo and in the areas surrounding the city, where Serb forces were stationed and they saw nothing at the time to suggest that \"sniper tourism\" was taking place.One soldier described the allegations that foreigners had paid to shoot at civilians as an \"urban myth\".",

    "body": "1 day agoGuy DelauneyBalkans correspondentGuy Delauney/BBCRussian state-owned energy companies own more than half of Serbia's national oil firm NISAn impasse over Russian oil and imminent US sanctions has put Serbia at loggerheads with its traditional ally in Moscow.Added differences over Russian gas supplies and Serbia's arms trade have ramped up the tensions, with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic trading barbs with the Kremlin.The root of the problem, and the most pressing issue, is the fate of Serbia's national oil company.Russia's Gazprom and Gazprom Neft own more than half the shares of Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS). That has put the company in a tight spot, after US sanctions on NIS came into effect last month over its ties to Russia's energy industry.Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic has told the BBC that NIS's Russian owners have now asked the US for a waiver, which indicated \"the Russian side was ready to transfer the control and influence upon the company to a third party\". But she warns time is running out.The impact of US sanctions on NIS has been immediate. Its petrol stations have put up signs warning customers that Visa and Mastercard can no longer be used to pay for fuel, as the US credit card giants have stopped processing payments. The same applies to outlets of NIS's Russian shareholders. At a Gazprom service station on the motorway between Novi Sad and Belgrade, Bojan and his colleagues were taking no chances, pumping the petrol and diesel for their customers. That gave them the opportunity to check whether the drivers had the means to pay, and Bojan said about one in 10 customers did not – \"mostly foreigners\". A cash machine has been installed inside the service station just in case.Guy Delauney/BBCGazprom-owned service stations in Serbia are now only taking cashNIS operates both of Serbia's oil refineries, providing more than four-fifths of its petrol and diesel, and almost all its jet and heavy fuels.Serbia is landlocked, so it relies on Croatia to deliver oil via its Janaf pipeline. But since sanctions kicked in, the flow has been cut off.The refineries will run out of crude to process before the end of November, which is why the energy minister says time is running out.Serbia is not the only Balkan country grappling with US sanctions.Neighbouring Bulgaria has passed legislation to take over its only oil refinery from Russian oil giant Lukoil, ahead of sanctions kicking in on 21 November.Hungary's Viktor Orban has secured a one-year waiver from his ally President Donald Trump.At the start of November a queue of NIS tankers could be seen waiting for entry to the jet fuel storage facilities at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport, delivering supplies while they still could.National airline Air Serbia told the BBC that it was \"adjusting [its] business activities\" and had taken \"the necessary steps\" to ensure it could keep its planes in the air.Russia's shareholders have not been in a rush to sell their stakes in NIS, even though Belgrade says they are now prepared to act. Nationalisation would be another possibility, as in Bulgaria, but Serbia has been reluctant to follow suit, in large part due to its longstanding friendship with Russia. Unlike its neighbours it is not part of the EU, which has banned imports of Russian oil, although it is a candidate to join.Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool via REUTERSRelations between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Serbia's Aleksandar Vucic have cooled in recent monthsThe episode has undoubtedly strained relations with Moscow. Behind the scenes, there is a great deal of exasperation in Serbian government circles.The energy minister chose her words carefully, but her frustration was clear.\"The overall income in the Gazprom group of NIS is insignificant,\" Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic told the BBC.\"We know NIS is not crucial for Russia's energy sector and contributing significantly to any income for the Russian government. However, for Serbia it is very important.\"\"These [US] sanctions will harm Serbian people, because of the majority share that NIS has in the market. NIS employs 13,500 people in Serbia, so employees are important for us as well as stability in the market.\"Oil is not the only problem. Serbia also relies on Russian gas, delivered at a highly favourable rate. But the current supply deal expires at the end of the year – and Moscow seems in no rush to renew, leaving President Vucic \"very disappointed\".\"It is obvious we didn't get the gas agreement because there is a possibility that we could nationalise NIS,\" says Zeljko Markovic, a Serbian energy sector consultant.\"We can supply Serbia without Russian gas, but the question is at what price? We have been using Russian gas at a lower than market price. And are we prepared with the contracts and the capacities?\"Arms and ammunition exports have also soured relations with Russia. Serbia's defence companies have not supplied Ukraine directly, but they have made deliveries to third countries which then re-exported the munitions.Earlier this year, Moscow made it clear this was no longer acceptable – and President Vucic imposed an export embargo. But at the end of last month he changed tack, saying he was happy for Serbia to export arms and ammunition to EU countries, adding that the buyers could \"do what they want\" with the deliveries.This triggered a testy exchange between Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova and Vucic.There are signs of movement.If the bid for a US waiver works, then the sanctions will be lifted, and oil will start flowing to NIS's refineries again. But there is still no sign of a gas deal – and the extent of the damage to Serbian-Russian relations may be significant.Vucic often insists that Serbia's path leads towards the European Union. If nothing else, this episode may strengthen that conviction.",

    "body": "How the Japan PM's Taiwan remarks provoked the fury of China1 day agoKoh EweEPA/ShutterstockJapanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Japan could respond with its self-defence force if China attacked TaiwanOver the past week, China and Japan have been locked in an escalating war of words.It all started when Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested that if China attacked Taiwan then Japan could respond with its own self-defence force.Since then, foreign ministries on both sides have lodged serious protests with the other, and a Chinese diplomat made what some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of Taiwan.Here's what to know.What happened? A timelineThe current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan last Friday, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan.\"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded.A \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat.Takaichi's remarks drew ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\".On Saturday, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\".While the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\", Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters on Monday.Tokyo has lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing has lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's.Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet.On Tuesday, Takaichi declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful commenting on specific scenarios from now on.A long history of animosityThere is a longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two.Historical grievances have remained sore spots in bilateral relations ever since. But the recent ascension of Takaichi, Shinzo Abe's protege, suggests more tensions may lie ahead.The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing.Getty ImagesThe US and Japan have been deliberately ambiguous on how they would respond, should China invade TaiwanTakaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion.China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region.Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea.Why Takaichi's recent comments caused such a stirThe Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan.This is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish.The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security.On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\".In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\".\"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter.\"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\"",

    "body": "43 minutes agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentPraful Gangurde/Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesMembers of India's Banjara community demand reservation benefits in MumbaiCounting castes in India has always been about more than numbers - it is about who gets a share of government benefits and who doesn't.The country's next national census, scheduled for 2027, will -  for the first time in nearly a century - count every caste, a social hierarchy that has long outlived kingdoms, empires and ideologies. The move ends decades of political hesitation and follows pressure from opposition parties and at least three states that have already gone ahead with their own surveys. A 2011 survey - neither run nor verified by census authorities or released by the government - recorded an astonishing 4.6 million caste names.A full count of castes promises a sharper picture of who truly benefits from affirmative action and who is left behind. Advocates say it could make welfare spending more targeted and help recalibrate quotas in jobs and education with hard evidence. Yet in a provocative new book, The Caste Con Census, scholar-activist Anand Teltumbde warns that the exercise may harden the deeply discriminatory caste system, when the need is to dismantle it.The argument cuts against the prevailing view that better data will produce fairer policy. For Mr Teltumbde, castes are \"too pernicious to be managed for any progressive purpose\". \"Caste is, at its core, a hierarchy seeking impulse that defies measurement,\" he writes.Mr Teltumbde sees the modern caste census as a colonial echo.British administrators began counting castes in 1871 as a \"deliberate response to the post-1857 unity of Indians across caste and religion\", turning it into an \"effective tool of imperial control\". They held six caste censuses between 1871 and 1931 - the last full caste enumeration in India.Each count, Mr Teltumbde argues, \"did not merely record caste, but reified and hardened it\". Independent India, in Mr Teltumbde's reading, preserved the system under the moral banner of social justice, \"while effectively evading its core obligation of building the capacities of all people, which is a prerequisite for the success of any genuine social justice policy\". The obsession with counting, he says, bureaucratises inequality. By turning caste into a ledger of entitlements and grievances, the census reduces politics to arithmetic - who gets how much - rather than addressing what Mr Teltumbde calls the \"architecture of social injustice\".He sees the demand for a caste census as a push for more reservations - a cause driven by an \"upwardly mobile minority\", while the majority slips into deprivation and dependence on state aid. Nearly 800 million Indians, he notes, now rely on free rations.Fairfax Media via Getty ImagesA 2011 unreleased survey recorded an astonishing 4.6 million caste names in IndiaAffirmative action quotas were first reserved for Dalits - formerly known as untouchables - and Adivasis (tribespeople), India's most oppressed groups. But soon, the less disadvantaged \"other backward classes\" (OBCs) began clamouring for a share of the pie. Politics quickly coalesced around demands for new or bigger caste-based quotas.Mr Teltumbde's deeper worry is that enumeration legitimises what it measures. Political parties, he warns, will exploit the data to redraw quotas or convert caste resentment into electoral capital. For Mr Teltumbde, the only rational politics is one of \"annihilation of caste\", not its management - echoing what BR Ambedkar, the architect of India's constitution, argued when he said that caste cannot be reformed, it \"must be destroyed\".But in an India where even its victims \"see value in its preservation\", that goal feels utopian, the author admits. The looming caste census, Mr Teltumbde argues, will not expose inequality but entrench it.Many scholars don't quite agree, seeing the census as a necessary tool for achieving social justice. Sociologist Satish Deshpande and economist Mary E John call the decision not to count castes \"one of independent India's biggest mistakes\".Today, they note in a paper, caste has come to be seen as the burden only of India's lower castes - Dalits and Adivasis - who must constantly prove their identity through official labels. What's needed, they write, is \"a fuller, more inclusive picture where everyone must answer the question of their caste\". This isn't an \"endorsement of an unequal system\", they stress, but a recognition that \"there is no caste disprivilege without a corresponding privilege accruing to some other caste\".In other words, the lack of reliable caste data obscures both privilege and deprivation.Sociologist and demographer Sonalde Desai told me that without a fresh caste census, India's affirmative action policies operate \"blindly\", relying on outdated colonial data.\"If surveys and censuses could shape social reality, we would not need social policies. We could simply start asking questions about domestic violence to shame people into refraining from wife-beating. We have not asked any questions in the census about caste since 1931. Has it eliminated caste equations?\" she asks.AFP via Getty ImagesBR Ambedkar, architect of India's constitution, argued that caste must be destroyed Political scientist Sudha Pai, however, broadly agrees with Mr Teltumbde's critique that counting castes can solidify identities and distract from deeper inequalities based on \"land, education, power and dignity\". Yet she acknowledges that caste has already been politicised through welfare and electoral strategies, making a caste census inevitable.\"A caste census would be useful if the income levels within each caste group are collected. The government could then use the data collected to identify within each caste the needs of the truly needy and offer them the required benefits and opportunities, such as education and jobs for upward mobility,\" Dr Pai says.\"This would require moving away from simply using caste as the parameter for redistribution of available resources, to use of both caste and income levels in policymaking.\"Dr Pai argues that if done \"thoughtfully\" - linking caste data to income and educational indicators - it could shift India from a \"caste-based to a rights-based welfare system\".Yet, scholars warn that counting castes and interpreting the data will be fraught with challenges.\"It won't be painless. India has changed tremendously in the century since 1931. Castes that were designated as being poor and vulnerable may have moved out of poverty, some new vulnerabilities may have emerged. So if we are to engage in this exercise honestly, it cannot be done without reshuffling the groups that are eligible for benefits,\" says Professor Desai.Another challenge lies in data collection - castes have many subgroups, raising questions about the right level of classification. Sub-categorisation aims to divide broader caste groups into smaller ones so the most disadvantaged among them receive a fair share of quotas and benefits.\"Castes are not made of a single layer. There are many subgroups within a single caste. What level of aggregation should be used? How will the respondents in a census respond to this question? This requires substantial experimentation. I do not believe this has yet been done,\" says Prof Desai.Mr Teltumbde remains unconvinced. He argues that endless enumeration cannot remedy a system built on hierarchy. \"You will be counting all your life and still not solve the caste problem. So what will be the use of that counting?,\" he wonders. \"I am not against affirmative action, but this is not the way to do it.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemEPAThe warehouse in Beit Lid was attacked, with lorries set on fireDozens of Israeli settlers launched arson attacks targeting a Palestinian warehouse, a Bedouin village, and farmland in the north of the occupied West Bank on Tuesday.Several Palestinians were injured.The incidents were the latest in a recent surge in settler violence coinciding with the olive harvest season, when Palestinians head to their agricultural land around towns and villages.It comes just after the UN's humanitarian office said the number of violent attacks by settlers last month was the highest since it began collecting figures nearly 20 years ago.Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law.Footage from Tuesday shows dozens of masked men on a hillside east of Tulkarm. A Palestinian warehouse in Beit Lid was attacked, with lorries set on fire.Tents can be seen ablaze in the Bedouin village of Deir Sharaf, with the sound of women shouting in the background.Palestinian Authority Minister Muayyad Shaaban, the head of the Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission, said the attacks were part of a campaign to impose \"a hostile environment through intimidation and terror\". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that troops went to the scene \"to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians\". It added that soldiers were then attacked by settlers gathering nearby and their vehicle was damaged.Israeli police stated that four suspects were arrested.In a post on X, Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the latest events \"shocking and serious\", blaming \"a handful of violent and dangerous individuals\".He went on: \"Such violence against civilians and against IDF soldiers crosses a red line and I condemn it severely.\"The head of the IDF Central Command, Major-General Avi Bluth, also condemned the attacks, saying that such incidents \"undermine the stability of the security situation\".\"The reality in which anarchist fringe youth act violently against innocent civilians and against security forces is unacceptable and is extremely serious. It must be dealt with firmly,\" he told officers, in comments sent by the Israeli military.\"The directive to IDF soldiers is clear: do not stand idly by and do everything in your power to prevent any act of nationalist crime.\"The large-scale attack on Tuesday was a rare instance of Israeli law enforcement acting to counter settler violence, which has increased dramatically since the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 triggered the Gaza war.Israeli rights group Yesh Din said that of 1,701 police investigations into offenses committed by Israelis against Palestinians in the West Bank (not including East Jerusalem) between 2005 and 2024, 93.8% of concluded cases closed with no indictment filed.EPAThe UN says the number of violent attacks by settlers in October was the highest since it began collecting figures in 2006The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that October saw more than 260 Israeli settler attacks resulting in casualties, property damage or both – an average of eight incidents per day.It reports that settler violence during the olive harvest has reached the highest level recorded in recent years, with about 150 attacks documented so far, resulting in the injury of more than 140 Palestinians and the vandalism of more than 4,200 trees and saplings across 77 villages.Since the start of the year, some 1,500 settler attacks have been recorded.The UN's Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, Tom Fletcher, recently wrote on X: \"The failure to prevent or punish such attacks is inconsistent with international law. Palestinians must be protected. Impunity cannot prevail. Perpetrators must be held accountable.\"Palestinians and human rights groups often accuse the IDF of protecting or aiding extremist settlers.On Tuesday, hundreds of mourners attended the funeral of 13-year-old Aysam Mualla in Beita, near Nablus. He was reported to have been in a coma since inhaling tear gas fired by the IDF as villagers were picking their olives last month, near the settler outpost of Evyatar.In some cases, Israeli activists and foreign volunteers have come to help Palestinian farmers during the olive harvest and have been attacked too.On Saturday, videos from Beita posted to social media showed masked men using clubs to beat local Palestinians and volunteer paramedics, as well as a Reuters news agency photographer and security adviser.An Israeli civilian, the 77-year-old head of a Tel Aviv art college, who had joined the harvest, was also photographed with blood streaming down his face.The BBC has approached the IDF for comment about this incident.ReutersReuters photographer Raneen Sawafta was beaten and stoned by settlers during an attack near Beita on Saturday, according to an Israeli activistIn the nearby village of Burin, settlers attacked Palestinian olive harvesters and an off-duty IDF reservist helping them. Settlers also stole bags of olives.In a statement, the IDF said: \"Several Israeli civilians threw stones at the harvesters. Several Israelis and Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment.\" It added that its soldiers \"operated to disperse the confrontation\".The olive harvest is a major annual event for Palestinians and an important source of income for many.According to the Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now, the number of new homes in West Bank settlements for which tenders have been published in 2025 has already reached an all-time yearly high of 5,667 housing units. It says these are set to accommodate about 25,000 residents.The pro-settler Israeli Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has prioritised speeding up the planning and approval process for new settler housing, as well as land appropriation for settlement construction and infrastructure, and retroactively legalising outposts set up without Israeli government authorisation.As well as serving as finance minister, Smotrich has a ministerial position with responsibility for civilian affairs in the West Bank. He has declared that his efforts are designed to de facto annex the West Bank and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.",

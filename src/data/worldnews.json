    "body": "US President Donald Trump is considering sending Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, saying it would provide \"a new step of aggression\" in its war with Russia.When asked on Air Force One if he would send Tomahawks to Ukraine, Trump replied \"we'll see... I may\".It follows a second phone call at the weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who pushed for stronger military capabilities to launch counter-attacks against Russia.Moscow has previously warned Washington against providing long-range missiles to Kyiv, saying it would cause a major escalation in the conflict and strain US-Russian relations.Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach for Ukraine.Trump spoke to reporters as he flew to Israel. He said he would possibly speak to Russia about the Tomahawks requested by Ukraine. \"I might tell them [Russia] that if the war is not settled, that we may very well, we may not, but we may do it.\"\"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,\" the president said.Kyiv has made multiple requests for long-range missiles, as it weighs up striking Russian cities far from the front lines of the grinding conflict.In their phone calls Zelensky and Trump discussed Ukraine's bid to strengthen its military capabilities, including boosting its air defences and long-range arms. Ukrainian cities including Kyiv have come under repeated heavy Russian bombardment with drones and missiles. Russia has particularly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing power cuts.Last month, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg suggested the US president had authorised strikes deep into Russian territory, telling Fox News \"there are no such things as sanctuaries\" from attacks in the Russia-Ukraine war.Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, downplayed the chances of Tomahawks changing the course of the war.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said last month: \"Whether it's Tomahawks or other missiles, they won't be able to change the dynamic.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoMartin MwangiBBC MonitoringMali has announced that US nationals visiting the West African country will be required to post a bond of up to $10,000 (£7,500) for business and tourist visas, in response to a similar requirement the Trump administration has imposed on its citizens.The US embassy in Mali said on Friday the fee had been introduced to reinforce Washington's \"commitment to protecting America's borders and safeguarding US national security\".Mali's foreign ministry said on Sunday the bond had been imposed unilaterally, and it had decided to \"establish an identical visa programme\" for US citizens.The visa policy shift comes despite moves to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries.In July, US officials visited Mali to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and economic partnerships, including potential access to Mali's gold and lithium reserves.Relations deteriorated after a coup in Mali in 2021 led to Gen Assimi Goïta sweeping to power. He pivoted the West African state towards Russia in a bid to stem a growing insurgency by jihadists. He expelled French troops, and brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, which is under Moscow's defence ministry. They have since been replaced by Africa Corps. Last week, Burkina Faso's military government refused to take in deportees from the US, as Washington suspended issuing visas in the West African nation.Foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré questioned if the embassy's decision was \"blackmail\" after he said he had rejected a US proposal to take in migrants from third countries.The Trump administration has turned to African countries as a destination to deport migrants to as part of its crackdown on immigration.",

    "body": "1 day agoNorberto ParedesBBC Mundo andAlex BoydWatch: 'A great honour for Venezuelan society' - Machado speaks to the BBCNobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado has told the BBC she is grateful for what US President Donald Trump is doing \"around the world for peace\".Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, was awarded the 2025 prize having long campaigned against the country's President Nicolás Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate.She told BBC Mundo that during a congratulatory phone call with Trump she told him \"how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy\".Trump has made no secret about wanting to win the award himself, regularly speaking about the seven wars he claims to have ended.Nominations for the award closed in January, just as Trump's second term as president began. A White House official said on Friday the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\".Machado said she was \"very glad\" to speak to the US president and was \"able to convey to him our appreciation\".The 58-year-old, forced to live in hiding for much of the past year, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said she was recognised for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\".He added: \"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.\"Machado was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office.The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest.Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement.\"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she added. \"The democrats around the world share our struggle.\"She said she thought Trump and the international community were already helping with the political situation in Venezuela.\"The regime in Venezuela is a criminal structure,\" Machado told the BBC. \"And as such, it sustains themselves on the criminal flows from their illicit activities.\"We need the international community to cut those flows that are not only used for corruption, but also for repression, violence and terror.\"So when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls.\"And that's exactly what we're seeing, cracks that are getting deeper and deeper as we talk right now.\"Earlier this month, US forces killed four people in an attack on a boat off the coast of Venezuela that was allegedly trafficking drugs.It was the latest in a number of recent strikes by the US on boats in international waters it said were involved in \"narco-trafficking\".They have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.On Thursday Colombian President Gustavo Petro said one of the boats was \"Colombian with Colombian citizens inside\", an allegation the White House called \"baseless\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent in IstanbulAt least 27 people have been killed in fierce clashes between Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City, in one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave.Masked Hamas gunmen exchanged fire with clan fighters near the city's Jordanian hospital, witnesses said.A senior official in the Hamas-run interior ministry said security units surrounded them and engaged in heavy fighting to detain them. The ministry said eight its members were killed in \"an armed assault by a militia\".Medical sources said 19 Dughmush clan members and eight Hamas fighters had been killed since fighting began on Saturday.Eyewitnesses said the clashes erupted in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in southern Gaza City after a Hamas force of more than 300 fighters moved to storm a residential block where Dughmush gunmen were entrenched.Residents described scenes of panic as dozens of families fled their homes under heavy gunfire, many of them displaced multiple times during the war. \"This time people weren't fleeing Israeli attacks,\" one resident said. \"They were running from their own people.\"The Dughmush family, one of Gaza's most prominent clans, has long had a tense relationship with Hamas, and its armed members have clashed with the group on several occasions in the past.The Hamas-run interior ministry said its forces were seeking to restore order, warning that \"any armed activity outside the framework of the resistance\" would be dealt with firmly.Both sides traded accusations over who was responsible for triggering the clashes.Hamas earlier said Dughmush gunmen killed two of its fighters and wounded five others, prompting the group to launch an operation against them.However, a source from the Dughmush family told local media that Hamas forces had come to a building that once served as the Jordanian Hospital, where the family had taken refuge after their homes in the al-Sabra neighbourhood were destroyed in the recent Israeli attack.The source claimed that Hamas sought to evict the family from the building to establish a new base for its forces there.Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.Reports suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying \"fighters in the streets\".",

    "body": "Trump directs Pentagon to 'use all available funds' to pay troops during shutdownDonald Trump is directing US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to pay military personnel despite the federal government shutdown. The president said on Saturday that Hegseth must make sure troops do not miss out on their regular paycheque, scheduled for Wednesday. The directive comes as other government employees have already had some pay withheld and others are being laid off.\"I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. The Republican and Democratic parties blame each other for failing to agree on a spending plan to reopen the government.Trump's message asks Hegseth to \"use all available funds to get our Troops PAID\" on 15 October, when military personnel would see their pay withheld for the first time since the shutdown began on 1 October.Many US military employees are considered \"essential\", meaning they must still show up for duty without pay. Some 750,000 other federal employees - about 40% - have been furloughed, or sent home, also without pay.Furloughed employees are legally supposed to receive back-pay after a shutdown ends and they return to work, but the Trump administration has insinuated this might not happen.\"The Radical Left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, and then we can work together to address Healthcare, and many other things that they want to destroy,\" Trump posted on Saturday.Democrats have refused to vote for a Republican spending plan that would reopen the government after nearly 12 days shut down, saying any resolution must preserve expiring tax credits that reduce health insurance costs for millions of Americans and reverse Trump's cuts to Medicaid, the healthcare program for elderly and low-income people.Republicans accuse Democrats of unnecessarily bringing the government to a halt, and blame them for the knock-on effects caused by the federal work stoppage.Finding a way to pay for military salaries could help reduce some of the political risk  for congressional leaders if the shutdown drags on.In an effort to pressure Democrats, the Trump administration has also begun laying off thousands of government workers, an unprecedented move during a shutdown.\"The RIFs have begun,\" White House Office of Management Director Russell Vought announced in a post on X on Friday morning, referring to an acronym for \"reductions in force\".The administration disclosed later on Friday that seven agencies had started firing more than 4,000 people, making good on the president's repeated threats to use the shutdown to further his long-held goal of reducing the federal workforce.The reductions included dozens of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to the BBC's US partner CBS news, citing sources familiar with the situation. The agency's entire Washington DC office was laid off, the sources told CBS, adding that among the laid-off employees were those working on the CDC's Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report, the agency's Ebola response and immunisations. There were also reductions in the human resources department, they said. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, told CBS that the let-go workers were not essential, and that \"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda\".Employees at the Treasury Department and in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Department of Homeland Security were also among those laid off on Friday, those agencies confirmed.   The American Federation of Government Employees and AFL-CIO, two major unions representing federal workers, have filed a lawsuit in northern California, asking a judge to temporarily block the layoff orders. \"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,\" AFGE president Everett Kelley said.A spokesman from the White House budget office told the BBC on Saturday that the layoffs were just the beginning.\"These RIF numbers from the court filing are just a snapshot in time,\" he said. \"More RIFs are coming.\"In a court filing opposing the unions' request for a temporary restraining order, the justice department revealed that agencies such as the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency could also see staff cuts. The government lawyers said the labour unions had failed to establish that their members would be irreparably harmed by the layoffs, which is needed for the judge to grant the restraining order. But they said a restraining order would \"irreparably harm the government\". Are you a federal worker in the US? Get in touch here",

    "body": "11 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondent andNick Edserbusiness reporterDonald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is \"a typical example of US double standards\", China's government has said.A commerce ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the US president carries out his threat, adding it was \"not afraid\" of a possible trade war.On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for rare earths exports, accusing it  of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\". He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping later this month.But on Sunday, Trump wrote: \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\" \"Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!\" Trump said in a post on social media, without elaborating further. Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China.In May, the two sides had agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods. which had raised the prospect of trade halting between the two countries.This left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a 10% tariff.China's response - released by the commerce ministry in the form of written responses to journalist's questions - echoed language from the height of the recent trade conflict.They criticised US export restrictions on chips and semi-conductors as well as defending China's own export controls on rare earths as \"normal actions\" to safeguard national security and that of all nations.The spokesperson said that for \"a long time\", the US had \"overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures\" and \"adopted discriminatory practices against China\".\"Resorting to tariff threats is not the right way to engage with China,\" the spokesperson said.\"China's position on a tariff war has always been consistent: we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.\"Last week, China announced it was tightening export controls on rare earths and other materials critical for advanced tech manufacturing.This was seen as key move, as the country processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, which are used in goods such as solar panels and smartphones.The recent comments from Washington and Beijing are being seen by some as a means of strengthening positions ahead of future trade talks.It is unclear whether a meeting between Trump and Xi, expected at a summit in South Korea later this month, will still proceed.",

The election went to a run-off after neither candidate won an outright majority in the first round two weeks ago.A former parliamentary speaker, Herminie was charged with witchcraft in 2023 in what he said was a politically motivated attempt to thwart his presidential ambitions. The charges were dropped in 2024, paving the way for him to run for office. \"I will be the president of all Seychellois, and I will end divisions by ceasing preferences and giving everyone the opportunity to thrive,\" Herminie said in his victory speech. Ramkalawan is the latest incumbent to lose elections in Africa, with Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera voted out of power last month amid growing discontent with the rising cost of living.Herminie's party, United Seychelles (US), won parliamentary elections with a solid majority last month, regaining control after previously losing it to Rakalawan's Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS).",

    "body": "11 hours agoSammy Awamireporting from Madagascar andFarouk ChothiaAFP via Getty ImagesSome troops joined protesters in the capital on SaturdayThe office of Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has said an attempt to seize power illegally and by force is under way in the country.Hours later, an army unit known as CAPSAT claimed that it had taken over the leadership of the military command, and was now in control of all the armed forces - land, air, and naval.This is the same unit that played a crucial role in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which helped Rajoelina rise to power.Madagascar was first hit by youth-led protests on 25 September against water and power cuts, but they have escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, corruption, and the cost-of-living crisis.Rajoelina's whereabouts are unclear, but in a statement he said \"there is an attempt to seize power at this time in the territory of the Republic, in complete violation of the Constitution and democratic principles,\" in a translation.He condemned \"in the strongest possible terms\" what he called an attempt to destabilise the country. He also called on all of the nation's key forces to unite in defending the constitutional order and national sovereignty.CAPSAT said it had appointed a new army chief of staff, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, according to a statement issued on its Facebook page.AFP news agency reports armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo has accepted the appointment.\"I give him my blessing,\" the minister was quoted as saying at a ceremony to install Gen Pikulas to the post.My one-month-old grandson was killed by police tear gas during Madagascar protestsProtesters have gathered at the main square in the capital, Antananarivo, for the second consecutive day. This is a significant development, as they had failed to reach May 13 Square, the focal point of previous uprisings, until now.  A protester told the BBC that they had \"finally conquered May 13 Square - the Square of Democracy\". \"We're happy and relieved. It's a great victory. We won't stop the struggle until President Rajoelina resigns,\" the protester added.Protesters have been celebrating their success in reaching the main square in AntananarivoThe success of the demonstrators came after they received unexpected support from CAPSAT on Saturday, when some of its troops left their barracks to join the demonstration. CAPSAT had condemned the use of force  against protesters by other security units. There were reports of a shoot-out at a CAPSAT camp on Sunday, following similar reports on Saturday. CAPSAT said one soldier was shot by gendarmes on Saturday, and died.Air France said it had suspended its flights to Antananarivo until at least Tuesday because of the security situation. The African Union said it was deeply concerned by the latest developments in Madagascar, and urged sides to resolve the crisis through dialogue.The protest movement, known as Gen Z Mada, has been rallying support mainly through social media, posing the biggest challenge to Rajoelina since his re-election in 2023.Some of the protesters have been wearing T-shirts and holding banners with a symbol - a skull with a straw hat from the Japanese manga series \"One Piece\" - used by youth-led demonstrators in other countries, including Indonesia and Peru.On Saturday, a statement from the presidency had assured the nation that Rajoelina and the new prime minister - an army general he appointed last week - were in control of the situation.AFP via Getty ImagesSome soldiers left their barracks to throw their weight behind the protest movementUN human rights chief Volker Türk previously urged security forces to stop using \"unnecessary and disproportionate force\" to quell the unrest. He said at least 22 people were killed and 100 others injured.Rajoelina disputed the figure last week, saying there were 12 confirmed deaths and \"all of these individuals were looters and vandals\".Madagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina come to power.Rajoelina governed for four years and then returned to power after the 2018 election.Despite its natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.Only about one-third of Madagascar's 30 million people have access to electricity, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).EPA / ShutterstockThe security forces have been accused of using excessive force against protestersMore on Madagascar's crisis:Behind the Gen Z protesters who want to force Madagascar's president from powerArmy general named as Madagascar PM to quell Gen Z protestsGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "2 days agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent in IstanbulHamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.The Palestinian group also appointed five new governors all with military backgrounds, some of whom previously commanded brigades in its armed wing.The mobilisation order was reportedly issued via phone calls and text messages which said the aim was to \"cleanse Gaza of outlaws and collaborators with Israel\" and told fighters to report within 24 hours.Reports from Gaza suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying \"fighters in the streets\".Tensions rose sharply and quickly after two members of Hamas's elite forces were shot dead by gunmen from the powerful Dughmush clan in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood. One of them was the son of a senior commander in Hamas's armed wing, Imad Aqel, who now heads the group's military intelligence.Their bodies were left in the street, triggering anger and raising the prospect of a major armed response by Hamas.Hamas members later surrounded a large area where more than 300 Dughmush gunmen were believed to be holed up, armed with machine guns and improvised explosives.This morning Hamas killed one Dughmush clan member, and reportedly kidnapped another 30.Some of the clan's weapons were looted from Hamas depots during the war, while others had been in the clan's possession for years.Palestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityWhat we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends.This is a key issue that could complicate the start of the second phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm.A Hamas official abroad declined to comment directly on reports of the security deployment, but told the BBC: \"We cannot leave Gaza at the mercy of thieves and militias backed by the Israeli occupation. Our weapons are legitimate... to resist occupation, and they will remain as long as the occupation continues.\"A retired security officer who served for years with the Palestinian Authority in Gaza said he feared the territory was sliding towards another round of internal bloodshed. \"Hamas hasn't changed. It still believes that weapons and violence are the only means to keep its movement alive,\" he told the BBC. \"Gaza is flooded with arms. Looters have stolen thousands of weapons and rounds of ammunition from Hamas stores during the war, and some groups have even received supplies from Israel. \"This is a perfect recipe for civil war: weapons, frustration, chaos, and a movement desperate to reassert control over a shattered and exhausted population.\"Khalil Abu Shammala, a human rights expert who lives in Gaza, said it remained to be seen whether Hamas would accept handing over control on the ground or seek to obstruct the plan's implementation.  \"There is undoubtedly widespread fear among many Gazans of potential internal fighting, given the many conditions that could fuel it,\" he said.He said Hamas had been forced to accept the peace plan by the severe pressure it was under.\"I believe its continued attempts to maintain influence by any means, including involvement in security affairs, could ultimately jeopardise the agreement and plunge Gaza's residents into even greater suffering,\" he said.These developments since the ceasefire earlier this week have sparked deep concern among Gazans already worn down by two years of a devastating conflict.",

    "body": "24 hours agoAlice CuddyTel Aviv andJaroslav LukivTel Aviv crowd boos as Witkoff thanks NetanyahuHundreds of thousands of people have held a rally in Tel Aviv, ahead of the expected release of Israeli hostages by Hamas.Addressing the crowds, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said the hostages \"are coming home\" and praised Donald Trump for making a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal possible.In Gaza, Palestinian officials said about 500,000 people had returned to northern Gaza - which lies in ruins - in the past two days, following the withdrawal of Israeli troops.Meanwhile Egypt confirmed it would host a summit on Monday to finalise an agreement aimed at ending the war.More than 20 leaders including Trump would attend the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson said. French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are confirmed to be travelling to Egypt on Monday.Trump is expected to visit Israel on Monday before heading to Egypt. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner also addressed the Tel Aviv rally on Saturday.Three members of Qatar's top administrative body - the Amiri Diwan - died in a car crash near Sharm El-Sheikh, the Qatari embassy in Egypt said on Sunday. Qatar has been mediating in the Gaza crisis.Under the ceasefire and hostage release deal announced on Thursday, Hamas was given 72 hours - until 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday - to release all the 48 hostages it is still holding after two years of war, 20 of whom are assumed to be alive.A top Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told AFP news agency that \"according to the signed agreement, the prisoner exchange is set to begin on Monday morning as agreed, and there are no new developments on this matter\".He said Hamas militants on the ground had not yet notified the movement's leadership about the logistics of the handover.Aviv Havron, whose family members were murdered and others kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas, told the BBC in Tel Aviv: \"It's so important for the community... that they come back. Without this, we can't restart our lives.\"My sisters and two brothers in law were murdered. Seven of my family members were kidnapped - my older sister was kidnapped, her daughter, her grandchildren. Four bodies of Be'eri [community] members are still in Gaza,.\"ReutersCrowds at the Tel Aviv rally unfurled a banner praising TrumpShulamit and David Ginat, who also attended the Tel Aviv rally, told the BBC all the hostages must be saved. \"They're our brothers and sisters. We want to heal again. We want to stop the war, stop the pain and heal again,\" Shulamit said.Many in the crowd yelled \"Thank you, Trump!\" - but also booed when Witkoff mentioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Speaking just afterward, the couple said they were angry at him over the failure to prevent the 7 October attack, the war and the failure to bring the hostages home sooner.\"He wants to continue the war only because he wants to stay prime minister,\" David said.Hamas mobilises fighters in Gaza as fears of internal violence mountHospital prepares for freed Israeli hostagesWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?What we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementIn Gaza, Hamas has called up thousands of fighters to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends and fears of internal violence. There have also been reports of armed clashes between Hamas and Gaza clans.Displaced Palestinians have continued to move north in Gaza in large numbers, in many cases arriving to find their homes destroyed.\"There is no house anymore. Everything is gone,\" lawyer Mosa Aldous said over the phone from Gaza City.Watch: Palestinians crowd around trucks to grab aid in Khan YounisRaja Salmi, 52, told AFP she reached Gaza City's Rimal neighbourhood to find her home also gone.\"I stood before it and cried. All those memories are now just dust,\" she said.Under the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, the amount of aid entering Gaza is due to be scaled up but the World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC that a surge of aid lorries had \"not yet\" entered Gaza, reporting only two to three lorries entering the territory daily.With full access, WFP, a UN agency, said it intended to restore its regular food distribution system, boosting aid through 145 distribution points across Gaza.Cogat, the Israeli military body overseeing the entry of aid into Gaza, said 500 trucks had entered on Thursday of which around 300 were distributed inside Gaza by the UN and other organisations.A recent report by the world's leading hunger monitor Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), backed by the UN, estimated that 500,000 people in Gaza - a quarter of the territory's population - were suffering from famine.Israel has repeatedly denied that starvation is taking place in Gaza, and Netanyahu has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas.About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 on southern Israel.Israel responded by launching a military offensive that has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

Community members gathered on Saturday for a candlelit vigil outside the Maple Valley Baptist Church after a blast at local explosives factory Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) left 16 people presumed dead.This community of Hickman and Humphreys Counties is \"not huge, so that's a lot of people to lose in an instant,\" Deacon Danny Bates said to the approximately 40 attendees, who comforted each other and sang hymns such as \"It Is Well With My Soul\".\"It was just another day at work, and then in an instant, they were gone. We have unanswered questions\".A concrete barrier on the side of a road reads \"Pray for AES families\".Vigil-goer Jerri Newcombe said her friend of more than 20 years was among the victims. The two met when Newcombe's granddaughter and the victim's daughter became close as little girls.\"They grew up together - we were in each other's homes,\" Newcombe told the BBC at the vigil. \"We celebrated birthdays together. It's just surreal, because she's gone and her babies are hurting,\" she said, referring to the victim's children and grandchildren. Local police have not publicly identified any of the unaccounted-for victims, who authorities presume have all been killed.Her friend was \"full of life\", Ms Newcombe said. \"She was the type of person that could make you laugh over anything, but you didn't cross her either, or she would tear into you,\" Ms. Newcombe added amid tears and laughter, as her granddaughter comforted her.Bucksnort is a close-knit town where the cell service is spotty and a gas station - adorned with a Confederate flag centrepiece - is the local watering hole, residents say. This tragedy has hit the area hard as the community mourns family, friends, neighbours and coworkers.The town had been holding out hope for good news after the explosion on Friday morning shook homes across the area, clouded the skies with smoke and drew a surge of hundreds of state and national first responders to an otherwise sleepy community tucked behind forests along a busy motorway.But after nearly two days with no sign of survivors and the explosion site still considered dangerous for first responders, even the previously optimistic Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said the time had come to switch to a recovery - rather than rescue - strategy.\"At some point in time, we have got to rip off the Band-Aid,\" Davis, who has held back tears at news conferences, said. \"We are dealing with remains.\"Hickman County Sheriff Jason Craft told the BBC on Saturday night that rapid DNA analysis was still ongoing, but that after a search by 300 first responders, authorities had enough confidence in their assessment of the scene to notify families that their loved ones were likely deceased. No cause of the blast has yet been identified, and agents from the national Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are investigating. It could take as long as a month for federal investigators to reach the main site of the explosion, ATF official Brice McCracken told the BBC. The volatile nature of the explosive materials has also hampered the emergency response, officials said, as controlled detonations to render the site safe are also expected in the coming days.Watch: Tennessee town comes together to confront tragedyTiffany Story says her cousin was also among the victims, along with four other people that she knew, including someone she once used to babysit for.\"Everybody knows everybody here,\" an emotional Mrs Story told the BBC. \"With everybody being so close, it's very comforting to have family. That's what we are - whether [by] blood, not blood, this whole community is family.\"\"There's probably never gonna be any answers\" to the tragedy, she said.Janie Brown said she also knew victims at the site. \"They were loved by their families and by the community,\" she said outside another prayer vigil at the Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church in nearby McEwen. \"It's just a sad, sad day,\" she said.Residents told the BBC the Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) company employed about 80 workers, and is one of the only private well-paying jobs around in these counties. For many here, the plant was known as a reliable first job for themselves or close friends.A recent job opening advertised a $19-per-hour salary for an entry-level manual labour job, more than double the state's minimum wage of $7.25.The factory has seen other difficulties, but none at such a scale as this.In 2014, an explosion at the company killed one person, and a 2019 workplace safety inspection led to relatively minor financial penalties, which the company settled, according to online records. Residents who spoke to the BBC had mostly positive feelings towards the company, and local police say they had no previous reports of unsafe working conditions.Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church Pastor Tim Ferris praised his congregation's response to the tragedy.\"One thing about a small community is that when something like this happens, they rally around each other, and they come close to be the hands and the feet of Jesus, to administer to these people, to care for them, provide for them. And that's a wonderful thing,\" he said.",

    "body": "1 day agoNavin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World ServiceGetty ImagesThe autumn hiking season is increasingly seeing extreme weatherClear skies, calm winds and a panoramic view of Himalayan peaks draped in snow - that is the autumn hikers on Mount Everest have come to love.But that seems to be changing.The monsoon now stretches into autumn, the traditional season for mountain tourism, meteorologists say, making weather more unpredictable.For the past decade, they have recorded at least one episode of extreme rainfall almost every year during the tail end of this longer monsoon - and in the mountains it is becoming quite dangerous.Last weekend, a shock blizzard stranded hundreds of tourists near the eastern face of Everest for days in freezing temperatures at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). Nearly 600 trekkers were guided to safety by the end of Tuesday, Chinese state media said. One person had died from hypothermia and altitude sickness, but the others were reportedly in good condition.This was on the Tibetan side but something similar had unfolded on the Nepal side, where a South Korean mountaineer died on Mera Peak. The world found out much later because communication lines were hit by torrential rains and heavy snowfall. Officials estimate that landslides and flash floods in the country have killed around 60 people over the past week.This is highly unusual for October \"when we expect the skies to remain clear,\" said Riten Jangbu Sherpa, a mountain guide, adding that trekkers have been increasingly caught in unexpected extreme weather in recent years.Given this is the favoured season, frequent storms like this have \"hampered our trekking and mountaineering business,\" he added.The monsoon season in northern India and Nepal usually lasts from June to mid- September, but not anymore.  \"Our data shows that most of the years in the past decade have had monsoons lasting until the second week of October, which is definitely a change,\" said Archana Shrestha, deputy director general at Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.More worrying is the heavy rain and snow the tail end of the season brings, like it did this time on 4 and 5 October - Ms Shreshtha described the pattern as \"damaging precipitation in a short span of time\". High in the Himalayas, such extreme weather means blizzards and snowstorms, which is a huge risk for trekking, mountaineering and tourism.ReutersA snowstorm this month trapped hundreds of tourists near the eastern face of EverestThat's what happened last weekend when the weather changed quite suddenly - the winds began howling, temperatures plummeted and visibility dropped drastically.  The road that had comfortably brought the hikers to what should have been a stunning pitstop was now buried in snow and impossible to traverse.On Cho Oyu, another mountain which stands between China and Nepal, a team of climbers on the 8,201m peak retreated temporarily as snow fell unabated. \"Now they are back after the heavy snowfall ended,\" said expedition operator Mingma Sherpa, whose team has six members.But for hikers trapped near the eastern face of Everest, the return was much dicier. Some told the BBC they battled hypothermia despite being dressed warmly while trudging along deep snow. Others said they didn't sleep for fear of being buried in the snow, which was falling so heavily that they spent most of their time clearing it.It could have ended tragically had it not been for a well-coordinated rescue, with yaks and horses deployed to clear the snow.Still, one trekker, who had hiked up these mountains more than a dozen times, told the BBC he had \"never experienced weather like this\".One big driver is the higher amount of moisture in the air because of how the world has been warming, scientists say. That has led to torrential rains over a short span of time, often after a prolonged dry spell – unlike in the past when monsoon showers were spread evenly over four months.\"The weather at this time of the year has been changing every year in recent years, we can't promise our clients anything,\" said Passang, a travel agent in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.\"September, October used to be peak season with pleasant weather but these days we see extreme weather all of a sudden and the temperature drops so quickly.\"Getty ImagesLandslides and flash floods in Nepal over the past week have killed dozensA turbocharged monsoonWeather experts say the monsoons in South Asia at times appear to have become stronger because they are increasingly coming into contact with another weather system, the westerly disturbance. This is a low pressure system that originates in the Mediterranean region and travels east - it carries cold air that brings rains and occasionally snow to northern India, Pakistan and Nepal. But when it meets air that is warmer and wetter - which is what happens during the monsoon - the result can lead to more extreme weather. Put simply, westerly disturbances can \"effectively turbocharge the monsoon\", said Akshay Deoras, a weather scientist at the University of Reading in the UK.The reason this is happening more often is that these weather systems have traditionally been a winter phenomenon, arriving between December and March in  northern India and the Himalayas. But now, meteorologists say, they are frequently arriving earlier, during monsoon and autumn.The deluge of rain and snow in eastern Nepal, where Everest is located, in early October was also because of the westerly disturbance, officials at Nepal's meteorology department said. They added that the westerly disturbance had fuelled a low-pressure system (a part of the tail end of monsoon) from the Bay of Bengal, pushing the clouds eastwards when in fact they should have moved west.Scientists have also found that in a warming world, the growing interaction between westerly disturbances and monsoons is producing another unusual result. The warmer air is pushing the clouds higher, which means these weather systems are now able to cross the Himalayas and reach Tibet and other areas that did not see so much rain before.  A study published in the journal Nature in June notes that \"the warming climate and the interaction between the westerly and the Indian monsoon are making the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau change into a warming and wetting climate\". The Tibetan plateau has always been home to a dry climate. And scientists say a warm, wet Tibet could mean unstable weather and frequent snowstorms and blizzards.\"What's changed is the reliability of patterns; we can't assume that conditions will behave the same from season to season,\" said Logan Talbott, chief guide with Alpenglow Expeditions that brings climbers to the Tibet side of Everest each year.\"That means flexible scheduling, real-time decision-making, and experienced leadership [in the Himalayas] have become even more important.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoAna Faguyin Martinsburg, West VirginiaBBCTroy Williams, Marcellus Brothers and Jonathan GibaIt's been three months since Jonathan Giba moved into temporary housing for homeless veterans inside a hospital for former members of the US military in West Virginia.He has been waiting for medical and dental consultations, after medications he was previously prescribed left him without teeth and unable to walk. Now, with the government shut down, he is preparing to wait even longer.He calls it \"political bs\". The US Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital where Mr Giba is staying in Martinsburg, West Virginia, is still providing medical care, but the VA stopped other programs that help veterans find jobs and transition from military life.\"The shutdown is a waste of time, and it hurts everyone in the meantime,\" the Army veteran says.Martinsburg is an American town particularly fixed to feel the impacts of the US government shutdown. A city of nearly 20,000 people some 85 miles (136km) outside of Washington DC, federal agencies employ upwards of 3,300 people in the area, between the veterans' hospital, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) processing facility and an agricultural assistance office. Another thousand or so federal workers commute to the nation's capital each day from the Amtrak station in Martinsburg's centre.This is Trump country, where 67% voted for the president in 2024 and a fierce independence undergirds something of a make-it-work mindset.  Because of the government shutdown, a nearby community event - the Freedom's Run Race Series - changed its route from trails near a federal Civil War battlefield site, but otherwise went on as planned. Harper's Ferry, a national park and nearby tourist draw, has been kept open with state money.But the political bickering in Washington and perceived lack of concern about everyday Americans are not far from people's minds. And they worry about what's coming as the shutdown drags on.On an unseasonably warm Monday nearly six days after the US government shut down, Mr Giba sits underneath the shade of a large tree chain-smoking cigarettes with fellow veterans. One of them, Troy Williams, says politics is hurting average Americans. \"This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue,\" he says, \"this is a why aren't they working on a solution issue.\"Air Force veteran Marcellus Brothers is concerned about what's ahead. \"We're in limbo, it's scary.\"What makes this US shutdown different (and more difficult)'No good outcome' - voters across US share concerns about shutdownTrump administration starts laying off thousands of workersRepublicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over government funding since it ran out on 1 October, and much of the government shut down, placing more than 700,000 people on unpaid leave. Some 200,000 other workers deemed \"essential\" are working without pay as the political standoff drags on.Politicians in Washington have pointed fingers in the direction of the opposing party. On Friday, the White House began laying off thousands of federal employees.In a state already hit by job cuts from the Trump administration's efforts to scale back the federal workforce, the shutdown threatens even steeper losses, Kelly Allen, the executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy warns.\"We have more federal government employees than coal miners in West Virginia,\" she says. \"Of course those jobs are well paying, come with good benefits and in a state with not a whole lot of good paying jobs those are really important.\"Tina Hissam, a small business employee in the area, has seen the impact of government shutdowns on her neighbours first hand. \"It hurts the small businesses, they may cancel services, they may not shop locally,\" she says of federal workers. \"The government shutdown has a huge impact and it's really scary, I just pray that it all goes away.\" Already, a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) service centre - which serves the seven surrounding counties - has shut its door. The office - responsible for assisting farmers, ranchers and landowners with tasks like applying for farm loans and disaster assistance - will remain closed until the government reopens. And on Wednesday, the IRS furloughed 34,000 workers, so the service centre in Martinsburg may soon be affected. History has shown that as shutdowns go on, more services are cut or shuttered because of a lack of funding.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito has so far remained unbowed despite the potential impact on areas she represents like Martinsburg. She has voted with fellow Republicans to provide government funding without healthcare subsidies that Democrats want. Both sides' proposals have repeatedly failed.In a local op-ed, Moore Capito noted West Virginia has the third-highest number of federal employees per capita in the country, but blamed Democrats' intransigence.\"These are our neighbours and friends - people who keep our miners safe, process veterans' benefits, secure our borders, and keep drugs out of our communities. They're now facing uncertainty about their pay checks through no fault of their own.\"When the first cheques since the shutdown arrive - or don't - on Friday that impact may finally hit.In previous shutdowns, federal workers who went without pay were given back pay, but it remains unclear if that will be the case this time around.\"The economic loss could have wide-ranging consequences on local communities, businesses and households. It could cause long-term damage to local economies,\" resident Mark Mulligan says.\"West Virginia is a poor state and dependent on federal jobs and handouts. The pain to the elderly, the disabled and to children could be catastrophic. \"",

    "body": "'Living a nightmare': Families of teens missing after ski resort fire desperate for news14 hours agoAleks PhillipsSuppliedThe families of teenagers missing after a fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort are facing an agonising wait for news and appealing for information about their loved ones online.The fire in Crans-Montana was likely caused by sparklers placed on bottles of champagne that came \"too close to the ceiling\", Swiss officials told a news conference on Friday.An investigation into the fire will focus on the materials used at the site, the bar's fire safety measures, its capacity and the number of people inside at the time, Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said.Swiss authorities have said it could take days if not weeks to identify the victims of the fire, which killed 40 people and injured another 119. Officials said 113 of the injured had been identified, with authorities still working to identify the other six.In the meantime, families and friends have been taking to social media to appeal for information about their loved ones who were at the bar that night.What we know so farSparklers on champagne bottles likely cause of fireWatch as partygoers try to put out flamesLaetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookSwiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, is among the missingThe whereabouts of Swiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, are currently unknown, his mother Laetitia said.\"I must find my son... it's been 30 hours since [he] disappeared,\" she told the BBC, adding that she wanted his photo \"to be everywhere so that, just in case, someone recognises him, they can call me\".Ms Brodard said that she and Arthur's father had been checking hospitals in Lausanne and Bern, but could not find him, earlier telling local newspaper Le Temps that she was \"living a nightmare.\"Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"SUPPLIEDAchille Barosi was described by his aunt as an avid painterAnother missing Italian national is Achille Osvaldo Giovanni Barosi, 16, who entered the bar at 01:30 local time on New Year's Day to retrieve his jacket and phone. His family have not heard from him since.\"We don't know if he's still alive,\" his aunt Francesca told the BBC World Service's OS programme.She described her nephew, who is enrolled in an art school in Milan, as a beautiful boy and an excellent painter.\"We just want to find him, and that's it.\"The Italian foreign ministry has said six of its citizens remain missing.Italian Golf FederationJunior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, was last heard from around midnight on New Year's Eve, according to his fatherAmong them is Emanuele Galeppini, a 16-year-old junior golfer, originally from Genoa but now living in Dubai.The Italian Golf Federation has said he is dead, without mentioning the fire, paying tribute to a \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father, Edoardo, is quoted by Italian TV channel TG24 as saying his son was at the bar and was last heard from around midnight. An Italian foreign ministry spokesperson has told the BBC that it was not confirming the death yet.Giovanni Tamburi, 16, is also among the missing. His mother, Carla Masiello, from Bologna, told La Repubblica that he had been on holiday with his father but had gone out with friends and ended up at La Constellation.\"A close friend of his told me they ran away after the fire broke out and that he had [his phone] with him, but then at a certain point he couldn't see him anymore,\" she told the newspaper, adding he had been wearing a gold chain with a small Madonna around his neck.Tania Causio, one of his teachers at Porta Saragozza High School, told La Repubblica: \"I've always been struck by his kindness and smile, coupled with great maturity. Every time I walk into class, he asks if I want him to go get me a coffee.\"Lisa Pralong Elisabeth/FacebookFamily of Emilie Pralong face an \"agonising\" wait for information on the 22-year-oldAlso reported missing by family members is Emilie Pralong, 22, who is thought to have been at Le Constellation with several friends who may also be missing.Her grandfather, Pierre, described an \"agonising\" wait for information, telling French broadcaster BFMTV: \"We always hope - we are full of hope. It helps to overcome whatever the hardship.\"While he expressed optimism that she may turn up relatively unharmed in hospital, he said: \"We have to be ready to accept a more difficult situation. We mustn't dream, we have to be realistic in the face of a tragedy like this.\"SuppliedDual national Alice Kallergis was also at the bar on New Year's EveAlice Kallergis, who holds dual Greek and Swiss nationality but lives permanently in Switzerland, was also at the bar on New Year's Eve, according to sources and reports in Greek media.Her brother has posted an appeal on Instagram, saying the family has had \"no news\" regarding the 15-year-old or the three friends she was with and who are also reported missing.Greek consular authorities say they are continuing to monitor the situation closely.Additional reporting by Nikos Papanikolaou and Isabella Bull",

    "body": "3 days agoRozina SiniandTom BennettReutersA train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash on TuesdayA passenger has described \"chaos\" after two trains collided head-on near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.Niels Honkoop, 33, told the BBC he had switched seats part-way through the journey from the middle of the train to the back, before it crashed, injuring many of those sitting near the front.\"I saw staff running around and people crying and people on the floor and chaos erupted,\" he said. \"We got off the train and I saw people bleeding with very severe injuries.\"A train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash, which took place at around 13:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Tuesday. Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Niels HonkoopNiels Honkoop (right) described the accident as \"chaos\"\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuMore on this story",

    "body": "A hiker is believed to have been killed by at least one mountain lion in the US state of Colorado on Wednesday, according to wildlife officials.If confirmed, it would be the first fatal attack there since 1999.A group of hikers found the woman's body on a remote trail and spotted a lion nearby. After scaring the predatory cat off, they checked the body and could find no pulse, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) Spokesperson Kara Van Hoose said.It is not known if one or multiple animals were involved in the attack, she added. Two mountain lions have been euthanised after an extensive search, and investigators are currently studying them for signs of human DNA.The hikers had thrown rocks at the mountain lion to drive it away, Ms Van Hoose told a press conference. CPW officers responding to the scene shot the lion, which ran off. They then tracked it to euthanise it.A second lion was found in the area and was also euthanised.If neither lion appears to be the culprit, the search will resume for a possible attacker. Under CPW rules, wildlife that kills a human being must be euthanised for public safety reasons.The woman's body showed signs of a mountain lion attack, according to Ms Van Hoose.The local sheriff's office has notified her next of kin, and will later release her identity, Ms Van Hoose told the BBC. She is believed to have been hiking alone.The Crosier Mountain Trail is north of Denver, near the Wyoming border, and close to Rocky Mountain National Park. It could be considered secluded, Ms Van Hoose said, adding hikers often lose their cell signals.The Larimer County sheriff, police from the nearby city of Estes Park, and volunteer firefighters have been assisting in the search.A biologist conducting a deer survey by helicopter in the area helped look for the animal and transport personnel, according to CPW. Meanwhile, houndsmen brought dogs in to track scents, which Ms Van Hoose said is an often-effective way to locate mountain lions.Mountain lion attacks - both fatal and not - are rare in the state, with CPW recording 28 total since 1990.Mountain lions, also called pumas, cougars, catamounts or panthers, can be found throughout North America, but now are mostly in 15 western states, according to the Mountain Lion Foundation.  They are mostly solitary animals, who spend most of their time hunting, according to the foundation. ",

    "body": "1 hour agoClaire KeenanWatch: Earthquake interrupts Mexico's president during press conferenceAt least two people have died after a powerful earthquake hit southern and central Mexico on Friday.The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the south-western state of Guerrero, which suffered moderate damage.A 50-year-old woman died in Guerrero, the state's governor Evelyn Salgado said, while Clara Brugada, Mexico City's mayor, confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man and said 12 others had been injured in the capital. Mexico is situated in one of the world's most seismically active areas, sitting at the meeting point of four tectonic plates.Late on Friday night, Brugada said power has been restored to \"98% of the failures reported\" in Mexico City.Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, she said, while 34 buildings and five homes were being inspected as a preventative measure.Damage assessments are under way in Mexico City after roads and hospitals were impacted, according to news agency Reuters, while authorities noted various landslides on highways around the Guerrero state. Mexico's seismological service had registered 420 aftershocks by midday local time (18:00 GMT).President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.  In a video capturing the moment, Sheinbaum can be heard saying \"it's shaking\" as an earthquake alert system rings in the background. She then tells the media to \"all get out calmly\". Additional footage shows buildings shaking in Mexico City and cars trembling in Acapulco.Getty ImagesThe inside of a house damaged by the quake in San Marcos, Guerrero state, MexicoAfter hearing the Mexican Seismic Alert System early on Friday, residents and tourists rushed into the streets of Mexico City and Acapulco.The seismic system was put into place following the deadly 1985 earthquake that claimed more than 10,000 lives.In 2017, a 7.1 magnitude quake killed more than 200 people and toppled dozens of buildings in Mexico City.",

Police sources told the BBC the charges included causing death by dangerous driving.Joshua's personal trainer, Latif Ayodele, and strength coach, Sina Ghami, died on Monday after the vehicle they were travelling in crashed into a stationary truck on a highway in Ogun state, near Lagos.The former heavyweight champion was taken to hospital with injuries after the crash and was discharged on Wednesday.Prosecutors brought four charges against Mr Kayode - causing death by dangerous driving, reckless and negligent driving, driving without due care, and driving without a valid driver's licence, a police source told the BBC.The defendant was granted bail in the sum of 5,000,000 Naira (£2,578) and was remanded pending his bail conditions being met.The case has been adjourned until 20 January.Joshua, 36, was a passenger in a Lexus SUV that collided with a parked truck on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway, in south-west Nigeria, on Monday.Mr Ghami and Mr Ayodele were both pronounced dead at the scene, while Joshua was pictured being helped from the wreckage.Federal Road Safety CorpsNigeria's road safety authority shared this image of the crash site on MondayOgun and Lagos state officials said in a statement that the British boxer was \"heavy hearted\" over the deaths of the two men, who were both his close friends.After being discharged from hospital, Joshua visited the funeral home where their bodies were \"being prepared for repatriation\", the statement added.Just hours before the crash, Joshua posted a video to Instagram of him playing table tennis with Mr Ayodele.On Wednesday, Eddie Hearn, who has been Joshua's promoter for more than a decade, paid tribute to the team members.\"Rest in peace Latz and Sina,\" Hearn posted on Instagram.\"Your energy and loyalty among so many other great qualities will be deeply missed. Praying for strength and guidance for all their family, friends and of course AJ during this very difficult time.\"Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town in Ogun state, near the crash site.He was on his way to visit relatives for New Year celebrations in the town at the time of the crash, a family member told the BBC.

    "body": "Two people including a three-year-old child have been killed and around 28 others injured in a Russian strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A multi-storey residential apartment block was almost completely destroyed in the dual missile attack on Friday afternoon, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called \"heinous\". Russia's Defence Ministry denied reports of an attack, suggesting the blast had been caused by Ukrainian ammunition detonating.The strike comes ahead of crunch talks on a US-brokered peace plan in Kyiv on Saturday.Zelensky says around 15 countries are expected to attend the talks, along with representatives from the EU and Nato, with a US delegation joining the meeting via video link. Leaders of the so-called coalition of the willing are then set to meet in France on 6 January.Officials in Kharkiv said the bodies of a woman and a three-year-old child were found in the rubble, with preliminary information suggesting the pair may have been a mother and son. \"Unfortunately, this is how the Russians treat life and people – they continue killing, despite all efforts by the world, and especially by the United States, in the diplomatic process,\" Zelensky wrote on X.Of the 28 injured, which included a six-month-old baby, 16 have been taken to hospital. A search and rescue operation is ongoing, with more than 80 volunteers working at the scene, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that its armed forces \"neither planned nor launched attacks using missile weapons or aircraft weapons within the city of Kharkiv\".It added that footage from before the attack showed \"heavy smoke of unknown origin\", which it cited as evidence of ammunition detonated by Ukrainian armed forces.The ministry also alleged that the reports were seeking to distract attention from a New Year's Eve strike on a hotel in a Russian-held part of the southern Kherson region of Ukraine.Russia has accused Ukraine of killing at least 27 people and injuring more than 30 others in the drone strike on a New Year's party in the village of Khorly on the Black Sea.The BBC has not been able to independently verify either these claims or the number of casualties.Ukraine told the BBC it would not directly respond to sources of information such as claims from governors of occupied regions.It added that it adhered to the norms of international humanitarian law and conducted strikes exclusively against military targets.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened an investigation into the attack, while the Russian foreign ministry accused Zelensky of \"seeking to intimidate the populations of the reunited Russian regions, who have forever linked their fates with Russia through referendums\".",

    "body": "Italian pasta is set to be spared from high-level US tariffs that the Trump administration had threatened against 13 producers. The move could have resulted in American importers being taxed at a rate greater than the value of the actual pasta itself, and prices rising sharply for US consumers.But on Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry said the proposed rate had now been drastically cut back.In a statement of its own, the US said the 13 firms had addressed many of its concerns. It previously accused the companies of selling their products at unfairly low prices and threatened tariffs of almost 92%.Tariffs are a type of tax paid by a consumer who imports a product. Since returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has unleashed a wide-ranging programme of these taxes, though some have since been softened. The president has sought to address trade practices that he sees as harmful to the US and boost American manufacturing. But economists have consistently warned that such moves can ultimately drive up costs for consumers, worsening cost-of-living issues.In the case of pasta, the US alleged that Italian-made goods were being sold at \"less than normal value\" in the US, which undercut local producers. This pricing policy is sometimes known as dumping.The commerce department was planning to charge a tariff rate of 91.74% for American imports of pasta made by the 13 Italian producers. Given that there is now an underlying 15% tariff on most products bought into the US from the European Union, the plan would have resulted in the rate of tax on pasta exceeding 100% of its value. It sparked fears of consumers experiencing major price increases, although the produce made by the 13 companies represents only a small share of total Italian pasta imported into the US.The plan would have also represented a political headache for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who enjoys a relatively close relationship with Trump among European leaders.On Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry announced that the US had wound back its plan, saying this represented \"an acknowledgement by the US authorities of the constructive co-operation shown by Italian companies\".In the case of one brand, La Molisana, the tariff rate had been dropped as low as 2.26%, the Italian statement added. Others will face slightly higher rates, up to 13.98%.In a statement of their own, which was given to the BBC's US partner CBS News, a US commerce department spokesperson said: \"[Our] post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination. \"Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination.\"Other Trump tariffs that have recently been softened include a planned increase in the tax charged on imports of furniture items - which was postponed for 12 months shortly before it was due to take effect on New Year's Day.And in November, the president signed an order that allowed certain key food products - including coffee, bananas and beef - to escape his tariffs.",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" of demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.Meanwhile, an Iranian police spokesman said officers would not allow what he called \"enemies\" to turn \"unrest into chaos\".Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while and another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the country's Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi-Azad warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with a \"decisive response\".Iran's UN Ambassador Amir-Saeid Iravani called on the UN Security Council to condemn Trump's statement in letter to the secretary-general and president of the Security Council on Friday, news agency Reuters reported. \"Iran will exercise its rights decisively and proportionately. The United States of America bears full responsibility for any consequences arising from these unlawful threats and any ensuing escalation,\" he wrote in the letter.",

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is among some 60 female lawmakers petitioning for more women's toilets in the parliament building to match their growing representation in the legislature.A record 73 women were elected into the 465-seat Lower House in October 2024, exceeding the previous high of 54 in 2009.One opposition lawmaker, Yasuko Komiyama, said there were often \"long queues in front of the restroom... before plenary sessions start\", and quoted another MP who said she had \"given up\" going to the toilet before a session began. There is one female toilet with two cubicles near the plenary chamber, though the entire building itself has nine female toilets with 22 cubicles.There are a total of 12 men's toilets with 67 stalls and urinals across the building, according to local media reports. The current situation is \"often inconvenient\" because female staff and visitors also share the toilets, said Ms Komiyama from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party.\"I want to raise my voice and prepare myself for the day when women hold more than 30% of [parliamentary seats] in the future,\" she wrote in a post on Facebook.Japan's parliament building was built in 1936, a decade before women were given the right to vote in 1945. The first women were appointed to parliament in 1946.The parliament building is a sprawling three-storey structure, with a central portion that is nine storeys high. The building occupies 13,356 square metres (143,800 sq ft), the equivalent of about two football pitches, with a total floor area of 53,464 square metres.\"If the administration is serious about promoting women's empowerment, I believe we can count on their understanding and cooperation,\" Komiyama said, according to Japanese media.Chair of the Lower House committee Yasukazu Hamada has \"expressed a willingness\" to consider the proposal for more women's toilets, said an Asahi Shimbun report. The Japanese government earlier set a target of having 30% of leadership roles across all sectors of society held by women by 2020, but at the end of that year the timeframe was quietly pushed back by a decade.Women currently hold nearly 16% of the seats in the Lower House and about a third – or 42 out of 125 seats – in the Upper House.Takaichi, who became Japan's first female leader in October last year, had pledged to raise female representation in her cabinet to levels comparable to Nordic countries, which hold the top spots in terms of female leadership.But she has appointed just two other women to her 19-member cabinet.In Japan, the dearth of women's restrooms extends beyond the legislative chamber.Long lines in front of women's public restrooms are a common sight nationwide. Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had said his government would look into \"enhancing women's restroom facilities\" to make Japan a society where \"women can live their lives with peace of mind\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoJaroslav LukivandVitaliy Shevchenko,Russia editor, BBC MonitoringUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has named spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as his new chief of staff, just over a month after his previous top aide resigned in a corruption row.\"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues,\" Zelensky said in a social media post, alongside a photo of his meeting with Gen Budanov in Kyiv.The 39-year-old has until now led the Hur military intelligence, which has claimed a number of highly effective strikes against Russia.Zelensky also said he intended to replace his defence minister Denys Shmyhal, appointing his current minister of digital transformation Mykhaylo Fedorov to take up the post.Budanov's predecessor, Andriy Yermak, wielded enormous political influence throughout Russia's full-scale invasion, which began in 2022. He also led Ukraine's negotiating team in crucial talks with the US aimed at ending the war.Zelensky wrote on Friday: \"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the defence and security forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations. \"Kyrylo has specialist experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results.\" The president added that he had already instructed his new office chief to update and present key documents regarding \"the strategic foundations\" of Ukraine's defence.The chief of presidential staff in Ukraine is historically a very powerful position. There was a time in the 2000s when a presidential administration head in Ukraine wielded about as much power as the president himself.Ostensibly administrative, the role traditionally offered not just close access to the head of state, but also plentiful opportunities to pull the strings of government.For example, the chief of presidential staff could lobby for government appointments and apply pressure to business circles, often resulting in personal gain.Budanov's appointment suggests an intention to overhaul the role. It puts the president's office on a war footing - it will very likely be much more focused on security and the war with Russia.Later on Friday, Zelensky announced other changes to his top team. He said Fedorov had been nominated to serve as his new defence minister because he had \"decided to change the structure of the Ukrainian ministry of defence\".Federov, aged 34, is the youngest minister in the Ukrainian government. His key achievement so far is the development and implementation of Diya, a centralised digital platform for government services.He is \"deeply involved with drones\", and will be tasked in particular with training more drone operators, Zelensky said in his evening address. He added that Shmyhal remains \"part of the team\" and will be moved to another area of work.Zelensky said Budanov was being replaced by 56-year-old foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko.Budanov's predecessor, former chief of staff Yermak, 54, stepped down on 28 November, and his departure was seen as a major blow to Zelensky.Yermak quit shortly after his home in Kyiv was raided by the country's anti-corruption agencies. He is not accused of any wrongdoing, and the anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office Sap did not explain why they searched his property. In the past few months investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position at a delicate time.Kyiv, backed by its European allies, is seeking to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Russian officials have seized on the scandal, talking up corruption claims.",

    "body": "17 hours agoOsmond Chia,Business reporterandDanielle Kaye,Business reporterChina's BYD has overtaken Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of  electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival in annual sales.Tesla car sales dropped by nearly 9% in 2025 to 1.64 million vehicles sold worldwide, the carmaker said on Friday - its second consecutive year of falling car deliveries.Those figures placed Tesla behind BYD, which said on Thursday that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million.The US firm has faced a tough year with a mixed reception to new offerings, unease over Musk's political activities and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.Tesla's car sales fell 16% during the last three months of 2025. The drop was partly due to the repeal of a government subsidy that had helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,570) off the price of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles.Wall Street analysts have recently lowered their Tesla sales estimates for 2026, signalling an increasingly gloomy outlook.Chinese firms such as Geely, MG, and BYD - now the country's largest electric car company - have put pressure on Western rivals by pricing their vehicles below established brands.In October, Tesla responded by launching lower-priced versions of its two best selling models in the US in a bid to boost sales.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package. The deal, which was approved by shareholders in November, could see him getting a payout of as much as $1tn (£740bn).As part of the agreement, Musk also has to sell a million humanoid robots over the next ten years. Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\".Analysts say Tesla's robotaxi and self-driving rollout in 2026, which has helped send its share price to a record high, will be crucial to its overall performance.Though there are big questions surrounding Tesla self-driving ambitions, some remain optimistic. Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities says Tesla will own about 70% of the self-driving market over the next decade \"as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope\" of the firm.Besides Tesla, Musk's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels.Those commitments, along with running US President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) early last year, led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.Musk has since stepped back from his role in the US government.Despite BYD's rise in recent years, its sales growth slowed in 2025 to the weakest rate in five years, in part due to fierce competition in China, its key market.And despite BYD surpassing Tesla when it comes to car sales, the US firm has remained more profitable in recent quarters. Still, BYD remains a global EV powerhouse as its prices often undercut rival carmakers.The Shenzhen-based company's rapid expansion - especially in Latin America, South East Asia and parts of Europe - comes despite many countries imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EVs.In October, BYD said the UK had become its biggest market outside China. The firm said that its sales in Britain surged by 880% in the year to the end of September, driven by strong demand for the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U sports utility vehicle (SUV).",

    "body": "1 day agoMayeni JonesAfrica correspondent, JohannesburgChristian Parkinson / BBCArnold Ncube was unable to complete his education because he could not prove he was South AfricanMany people may take their birth certificate, or similar official papers, for granted - hidden in a drawer and rarely seeing the light of day - but for those without one, it can lead to a shadow life or an uncertain existence.This is thought to affect millions of people around the world, described as stateless, and 25-year-old South African Arnold Ncube is one of those.Because he has no state-issued documents, washing cars in the backstreets of Thembisa township near Johannesburg is one of the few ways he can make a living.He was born in Johannesburg and his father is South African, qualifying him for citizenship here. But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.Ed Habershon / BBCChristy Chitengu only found out at 17 that she was statelessHuman rights lawyer and advocate Christy Chitengu used to be stateless herself.She only got South African citizenship three years ago with the help of the organisation Lawyers for Human Rights who worked on her case for free.\"I found out I was stateless at the age of 17. My high school principal called me into her office and told me that she didn't have any documents for me and that she didn't understand how I'd gotten into the school,\" she tells the BBC near her home in northern Johannesburg.\"I was born in Johannesburg to two foreign parents [both from Zimbabwe] and at my birth I was given a handwritten South African birth certificate.\"But officials in South Africa need a printed certificate.Christy says that when she found out she was stateless she looked into taking her parents' nationality but it was too late.\"I couldn't claim my Zimbabwean citizenship because by that time I was 16 and they wouldn't allow me to do a late birth registration. Also I would have had to physically leave South Africa to get a Zimbabwean passport and without any documents to leave the country, I wouldn't be allowed back in.\"South Africa has large numbers of undocumented migrants and the authorities and local vigilante groups have been trying to crack down on irregular migration for years.When asked whether giving stateless children citizenship could be seen as a reward to undocumented migrants who give birth in South Africa, Christy disagrees.\"I think citizenship is not a reward. It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being. I think if we look at it through that lens, we realise that there's nothing that we lose by recognising a child who would otherwise not be able to go to primary school or receive healthcare.\"Getty ImagesIn South Africa, an estimated 10,000 people are stateless On several occasions, the BBC contacted the home affairs department, which handles immigration issues in South Africa, to find out how it is tackling the issue of statelessness but got no reply.Statelessness is not just an issue here, it is a huge global problem.There's an estimated 4.5 million stateless people around the world. Some say the figure could even be as high as 15 million.Experts believe tackling the problem requires policy changes, including allowing refugees to register their children where they're born, and giving mothers the right to pass their nationality to their children.\"For us statelessness is not just a legal issue, it's a matter that involves the right to development,\" says Jesus Perez Sanchez who works for the UNHCR.\"That person that's affected by statelessness will not be able to contribute fully to that country that is hosting. So we think that it's important that as a matter of inclusion, all issues of statelessness are addressed so that all these people on the margins of society can contribute fully to society and the economy.\"Back in Thembisa, Arnold is playing football with local children.After years of struggle, he now has a lawyer helping him fight for the papers that prove he belongs here. He wants to go back to school to study computer science. He hopes having documents will lead to a brighter future.Additional reporting by Christian ParkinsonMore from South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Indian families grieve deaths caused by contaminated tap water 23 hours agoSameer Khan,IndoreandAbhishek Dey,DelhiSameer KhanMore than 200 people are admitted in hospitals in IndoreSunil Sahu bitterly regrets the day his five-month-old son was given some cow milk diluted with tap water.Avyan was being breast-fed but his father says the family - who live in Indore city in India's central Madhya Pradesh state - gave him the diluted mixture in addition.In many Indian families, cow's milk is believed to be too thick for infants and capable of upsetting their digestion, leading caregivers to dilute it.Aware that tap water is unsafe to drink, the family said they boiled the milk–water mixture and allowed it to cool before feeding Avyan.The infant started suffering from diarrhoea on 26 December. Despite being treated by a local doctor, the child died within three days. Mr Sahu alleges that the tap water killed his son.Avyan is among several people suspected to have died after drinking contaminated water in Indore's Bhagirathpura neighbourhood. Investigations are still going on but officials say that a pipeline leak led to sewage mixing with drinking water, leading to a diarrhoea outbreak in the area.The exact death toll remains unclear. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav said postmortem reports have so far confirmed four deaths linked to contaminated drinking water.But the number is likely to increase. While state minister Kailash Vijayvargiya says he has heard about eight deaths so far, local journalists told BBC Hindi that the toll is close to 14. More than 200 people have been admitted to hospitals in the city.Over the past week, around 40,000 residents of Bhagirathpura - a neighbourhood of largely poor and lower-middle income families - were screened by health authorities and around 2,450 cases of vomiting and diarrhoea were identified, said the government.The deaths in Indore - often ranked India's cleanest city - have sparked an uproar and put the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive.District Magistrate Shivam Verma said the leak that caused the contamination has been fixed and officials are checking for others. One municipal officer has been dismissed and two suspended.\"It should not have happened in the first place. We have set up a committee to investigate the matter, and no stone will be left unturned to make sure that it does not happen again,\" Chief Minister Yadav told the media. The local municipal corporation is currently supplying water to Bhagirathpura through tankers. Residents say they have been told not to use tap water until further notice.Sameer KhanNandalal Pal (left) and Seema Prajapat (right) are among the victimsWhile government teams conduct inspection drives in Bhagirathpura, families are grieving.Sanjay Yadav, a tailor, says his 69-year-old mother started vomiting on the evening of 26 December. \"We took her to a hospital, but she died in less than 24 hours,\" said Mr Yadav, whose 11-month-old son is also unwell.His neighbour Sudha Pal's 76-year-old father Nandalal Pal also died after a bout of severe diarrhoea. \"The tap water in our house is still contaminated and it stinks,\" she says.\"The water smelt foul, but we never thought it could kill someone,\" said Arun Prajapat, who alleges that his mother Seema died after consuming the contaminated water.According to media reports, residents of Bhagirathpura had complained about the foul-smelling and contaminated water for more than two months before the diarrhoea outbreak.When asked about this, local councillor Kamal Waghela of the BJP told news agency ANI on Thursday that Indore's sewage and water pipelines need a lot of repairs and that work had been progressing in most areas. Jitu Patwari of the opposition Congress, however, accused the BJP government of misgovernance and hiding the actual number of deaths.\"Indore has consistently given votes to the BJP but they have given poisoned water instead,\" he told ANI.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "20 hours agoMakuochi Okafor,BBC AfricaandWycliffe MuiaAt least seven people have died and many others are missing after a boat carrying about 200 migrants attempting to reach Europe capsized off the coast of The Gambia, authorities say. The boat overturned on Wednesday midnight near Jinack village in the North Bank Region and it was later found \"grounded on a sandbank\", the country's defence ministry said in a statement. Ninety-six people have been rescued so far and a search is continuing for other passengers who were aboard the shipwrecked vessel that was heading towards Spain's Canary Islands.The perilous journey over the Atlantic Ocean has become an increasingly common route for African migrants trying to reach Europe.Nearly 47,000 people reached the Canary Islands in 2024 and the Spanish non-government organisation Caminando Fronteras estimates more than 9,000 migrants have died trying.After Wednesday's accident, the Gambian Navy launched a search-and-rescue operation, involving several naval vessels and a fishing boat that came to assist, the defence ministry said. The authorities did not say what kind of boat it was but they are typically large wooden canoes not designed for a journey of more than 1,500 km (900 miles) across the Atlantic Ocean. They are often overcrowded. Several of the victims are not Gambian nationals and their identities are still being verified, the defence ministry said.The bodies of seven people have been recovered, while 10 of those rescued are said to be in critical condition and receiving urgent medical care.The Gambia is increasingly being used by West African migrants and asylum seekers as a launchpad for the crossing to Spain's Canary Islands, and then on to mainland Europe.In recent years, the European Union has reached agreements with several North African countries aimed at reducing irregular migration, but this has pushed many migrants to take the longer and more dangerous Atlantic Ocean route.",

    "body": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said on Thursday he was open to talks with the US on drug trafficking and oil, after weeks of an escalating pressure campaign against his government.In an interview with Venezuelan state TV, Maduro said he was ready for dialogue with the US \"wherever they want and whenever they want\". He also evaded a question about a statement by President Donald Trump that the US had hit a docking facility in Venezuela - the first such attack inside the country reportedly carried out by the CIA. US forces have been hitting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific for the past three months.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" , with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September.The latest attack came on Wednesday when two boats alleged to be carrying drugs were struck, killing five people on board, according to the US military.On Monday, Trump said the US had carried out a strike on a \"dock area\" linked to alleged Venezuelan drug boats, causing a \"major explosion\".The blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA, according to CNN and the New York Times, which cited sources close to the matter. If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.But Maduro was elusive in the interview. Asked if he could confirm or deny the attack, Maduro said \"this could be something we talk about in a few days\". As well as drug trafficking, Maduro also said he was open for talks on oil and migration.In recent months, Trump has focused on fighting the influx of drugs - especially fentanyl and cocaine - into the US.The US president has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture and has announced that he would designate the Maduro government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.Counternarcotic experts say that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, acting as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is thought to enter the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.Without providing evidence, Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US.Close to eight million Venezuelans are estimated to have fled the country's economic crisis and repression since 2013 - some heading for the US.The US has also been cracking down on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.US forces seized an oil tanker off Venezuela on 10 December, saying it was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\". Venezuela described it as an act of \"international piracy\". Since then, the US has seized one more oil tanker and pursued a third. The Trump administration has cast its operations against alleged drug boats as a non-international armed conflict against the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs. But the US Southern Command again insisted this week that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

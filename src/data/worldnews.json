    "body": "17 hours agoJerome Wirawan,in Indonesia, and Aleks PhillipsReutersMore than 50 people have been injured in explosions during Friday prayers at a mosque in Indonesia, with authorities identifying a 17-year-old student as the suspected perpetrator. The incident happened at around 12:15 local time (05:15 GMT) inside a school complex that housed the mosque in Kelapa Gading - a district in the capital, Jakarta. The victims, mostly pupils, sustained a range of injuries, including severe burns. The suspect was also hurt, according to Indonesia's police chief, Listyo Sigit Prabowo. He added that an investigation into the incident is under way, \"including how the suspect assembled and carried out the attack\". A bomb disposal team was deployed to the state-run high school complex following the explosions to collect evidence and ensure there were no other explosive devices.A pupil at the school alleged to Indonesia's government-owned news agency Antara that a homemade bomb had been brought in by a student who had often been bullied by other students.Other pupils told Indonesian news outlets that the suspect was a \"loner\" who often made drawings depicting violence, and who had been found lying on the ground following the explosion.A cook at the school described seeing white smoke coming from the mosque and broken windows after the \"massive\" blast.\"Our hearts were beating fast, we couldn't breathe,\" she told the Reuters news agency.A high-ranking Jakarta Metropolitan Police officer confirmed the presence of two objects resembling firearms at the scene.Images from Antara suggest one of the objects appeared to be a submachine gun and another looked like a pistol.The submachine gun-type object appears to be inscribed on its barrel with: \"14 words. For Agartha.\"On its body, it says: \"Brenton Tarrant. Welcome to Hell.\"Brenton Tarrant is the perpetrator of a 2019 mass shooting at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 51 and injured dozens of others.A minister who visited the scene later on Friday sought to dispel suggestions that weapons were present at the site, telling CNN Indonesia what had been pictured \"turned out to be a toy gun, not a real gun\".Lodewijk Freidrich Paulus also called on the public not to presume the explosion was a \"terrorist act\" as investigators were still combing over the scene.Another object found at the site was a dark green belt for storing gun cartridges.Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population.",

    "body": "EU forces free crew after Somali pirate attack on tanker 14 hours agoRachel HaganEuropean Union Naval ForceThe Hellas Aphrodite was seized by pirates on ThursdayEuropean Union naval forces have rescued 24 sailors from a Maltese-flagged oil tanker that was attacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia.The Hellas Aphrodite, carrying petrol from India to South Africa, was seized on Thursday when armed pirates opened fire with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades before boarding the vessel. The crew locked themselves inside a fortified citadel while the attackers took control of the ship.A Spanish warship, the ESPS Victoria, operating under the EU's anti-piracy mission Operation Atalanta, reached the tanker on Friday afternoon. Special forces boarded the vessel and found all 24 crew members unharmed.\"The crew is safe and no injuries have been reported. Throughout the incident, they remained in the citadel in direct contact with Atalanta,\" the EU mission said, adding that a \"show of force\" had prompted the pirates to abandon the ship before the warship arrived.It added that the threat risk in the area \"remains critical\" as the pirates are still in the area. The rescue operation involved a helicopter, drone and surveillance aircraft. Just hours earlier, another ship in the same area was approached by a small speedboat but managed to evade it.It is the latest in a spate of attacks that have created concern about a resurgence of piracy in the area. Such activity had declined when international naval patrols and security measures were introduced after peaking more than a decade ago.However, attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea, which have been carried out for the past two years, have led vessels to be diverted through East Africa's Indian Ocean - creating new opportunities for Somali gangs.There were seven reported incidents of piracy that took place off the coast of Somalia last year, according to the International Maritime Bureau - including three hijackings. It reported only one incident of piracy in 2023. ",

    "body": "1 day agoLaura BickerChina correspondentChina's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third aircraft carrier, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds.Its entry into active duty marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships.  China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up.The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong.State media hailed the Fujian as a \"major milestone\" in the development of China's navy.The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian.The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea.State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: \"Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Manjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

    "body": "Serbia's parliament has passed a law which paves the way for a controversial property development led by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in the capital Belgrade.His firm Affinity Partners has sought to build a luxury hotel and apartment complex on the site of the former Yugoslav Army headquarters.The ruined building, which was bombed by Nato forces in 1999 during its intervention to stop Serbia's military campaign in Kosovo, has symbolic value to some who view it as a memorial and symbol of ongoing opposition to the military alliance.Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, who has pursued close ties with Trump, backed the plans despite protests and legal challenges.Last year, the Serbian government stripped the building of its protected status and agreed a 99-year lease with Kushner's firm, which had set out plans for a $500m (£379.9m) development. The decision triggered demonstrations and led to an investigation into whether a Serbian official had forged documentation used during the process to change the building's status.In a conversation with the BBC in June, Vucic defended the proposal, saying \"it's important to overcome the burden from 1999\". He continued: \"We are ready to build better relations with the US – I think that is terribly important for this country.\"The stalled planning process came to a head on Friday when Vucic's party - which has a majority in parliament - pushed ahead with a special vote on clearing the site and won.Opposition politicians have labelled the decision unconstitutional, including Aleksandar Jovanovic, who described it as a crime, and told the AFP news agency that the landmark would be replaced with \"casinos and Jacuzzis\". Meanwhile, centre-left MP Marinika Tepicċ said the government was sacrificing the country's history \"to please Trump\", Politico reported.The passage of the law has also been criticised by architectural experts, and comes after Transparency Serbia, an anti-corruption organisation, raised concerns about state-backed developments. According to Serbian media reports pre-dating his first presidential run, Trump has previously considered building a hotel in Belgrade.Last March, Kushner told the New York Times he was not aware of his father-in-law's reported past interest.The decision to clear the way for the development comes as Vucic's government seeks to maintain good relations with both Washington and Moscow.Serbia has been impacted by both Trump's tariffs and sanctions on Russian interests in the country, including on its sole oil-refinery, the majority Russian-owned Nafna Industrika Srbije (NIS).",

    "body": "16 hours agoJames WaterhouseEurope correspondentThe Belgian government has told the BBC it is urgently trying to acquire drone defences after a sighting forced its main airport near Brussels to close temporarily.Flights were paused at Zaventem airport on Thursday night, after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Defence Minister Theo Francken said. \"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Francken said several European allies have offered assistance, and he had accepted help from the German military which is providing anti-drone defences.About 3,000 passengers of Brussels Airlines were affected by the disruptions, and the carrier said it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.\"EU compensation schemes don't apply here,\" Joelle Neeb of Brussels Airlines told the BBC. \"But we do have an obligation to make sure passengers get to their final destination as soon as possible by offering refunds of alternative flights, as well as covering their hotels and transport.\"She added that drones were a \"new threat\" and as such, the airline was adapting its contingency plans.\"When our main airport is closed even for just 30 minutes, that has a big impact and we need to act fast.\"Drone sightings have caused major flight disruptions across Europe in recent months, including in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.Some officials have blamed \"hybrid warfare\" by Russia, but the Kremlin has denied it has anything to do with it.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius also alleges Moscow's involvement, suggesting these latest sightings could be linked to European Union discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.The controversial plan would see Kyiv receive a €140bn loan, but with the money being held in a Belgium-based bank, Euroclear. Brussels is nervous that it could be legally forced to pay Moscow back once the war in Ukraine ends.Belgian security services also suspect Russia, but Francken admits there is currently no accompanying evidence.In fact, amongst all the European finger pointing, there is no public proof suggesting Russia is responsible for these disruptions.Suspicions are nevertheless being fuelled by more serious airspace incursions that Moscow has recently carried out in Eastern Europe, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones.The Kremlin's likely goals are to both test European defences, as well as try to distract the bloc from supporting Ukraine, which is still on the receiving end of its invasion.Additional reporting by Bruno Boelpaep.",

    "body": "Israel has received a coffin that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said contains the body of a hostage, Israel's military says.Hamas's armed wing said the body had been found on Friday in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The body has been transported to Israel via the Red Cross for identification.Before this handover, Hamas had returned all 20 living hostages and 22 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal that started on 10 October. Five of the six dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis and one was Thai.Israel has criticised Hamas for not yet returning all the bodies. Hamas says it is hard to find them under rubble.During the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel has also handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel launched air strikes after accusing Hamas fighters of killing two of its soldiers on 19 October and of killing another soldier on 28 October. Hamas said it was unaware of clashes in the area of the first incident and had no connection to the second attack.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were abducted in the attack.At least 68,875 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

    "body": "21 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorWatch: The moment spectators confront a protester holding a flare during the Paris concertFour people have been detained by French police after protesters set off flares during a concert by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in Paris on Thursday night.Clashes broke out in the auditorium during one of three disruptions to the performance by conductor Lahav Shani and pianist Sir Andras Schiff.The concert, which featured a programme of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, had already been criticised by a French union for the performing arts, and pro-Palestinian activists had called for a boycott.However, Culture Minister Rachida Dati strongly defended freedom of creativity as a French value and Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said nothing could excuse the \"serious disturbances in the hall\".Ticket-holders tried to disrupt the concert three times including twice with a flare, the Philharmonie de Paris said in a statement. At one point concertgoers said the hall became filled with smoke.Video filmed inside the Pierre Boulez auditorium showed one man brandishing a flare as he walked down steps in a seating area. He was confronted by spectators and clashes broke out.\"The troublemakers were removed and the concert, which had to be interrupted, resumed and came to a peaceful conclusion,\" the venue said, adding that it was taking legal action.The disruption prompted an angry response from government figures on Friday, with Laurent Nuñez firmly condemning the incidents and praising police for their rapid response. But Manon Aubry, a European Parliament member for the radical left France Unbowed, refused to condemn the disruption on French TV, arguing that the orchestra's artists \"represent the Israeli state [which] commits war crimes\". Ahead of the concert, pro-Palestinian activists had pushed for its cancellation. Although the CGT-Spectacle union, which represents workers in the performing arts, did not go that far. It had called on the Philharmonie de Paris to \"remind its audience of the extremely serious accusations levelled against [Israel's] leaders\" and saw the concert as \"an attempt at normalisation by the State of Israel\".Hannes Magerstaedt/Getty ImagesThe Israel Philharmonic's performance was led by conductor Lahav Shani (file photo)Rachida Dati said nothing justified a call for a cultural boycott and said there was \"no excuse for antisemitism\".The Israel Philharmonic's star conductor, 36-year-old Lahav Shani, was at the centre of another controversy in September when the organisers of the Flanders Festival in the Belgian city of Ghent cancelled his performance with the Munich Philharmonic, citing \"insufficient clarity\" on his attitude towards the Israeli government.Its decision was criticised by both the Belgian and German governments and days later Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever attended a Munich Philharmonic concert with Lahav Shani conducting in the German city of Essen.Condemning Thursday night's disruption, the Philharmonie de Paris said that \"regardless of people's opinions, it is utterly unacceptable to threaten the safety of the public, staff and artists... bringing [violence] into a concert hall is extremely serious\".",

    "body": "France has advised its citizens in Mali to leave as soon as possible, as Islamist insurgents continue their blockade of the country.The French foreign ministry advised citizens to depart on commercial flights while they are still available, and to avoid overland travel.A two-month-old fuel blockade on Mali, imposed by al-Qaeda-affiliated group has upended daily life in the capital, Bamako, and other regions of the landlocked West African country - a former French colony.France's announcement came as MSC - the world's biggest shipping company - said it was halting its operations in Mali, citing the blockade and deteriorating security.The jihadist group Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) has caused the obstruction by attacking tankers on major highways.Mali has no coast so all fuel supplies are brought in by road from neighbouring states such as Senegal and Ivory Coast.Last month, the US embassy in Bamako announced that non-essential diplomatic staff and their families would leave Mali amid the crisis.It said the fuel disruptions had affected the supply of electricity and had the \"potential to disrupt the overall security situation in unpredictable ways\".Mali is currently ruled by a military junta led by Gen Assimi Goïta, who first seized power in a coup in 2020.The junta had popular support when it took power, promising to deal with the long-running security crisis prompted by a separatist rebellion in the north by ethnic Tuaregs, which was then hijacked by Islamist militants.The UN peacekeeping mission and French forces had been deployed in 2013 to deal with the escalating insurgency.Both have left since the junta took over, and the military government has hired Russian mercenaries to tackle the insecurity.However, the jihadist insurgency has continued and large parts of the north and east of the country remain outside government control.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGary O'Donoghue,Chief North America Correspondent, Washington and Rachel HaganDonald Trump has exempted Hungary from sanctions over its continued purchases of Russian oil and gas for one year, a White House official has confirmed to BBC News.Earlier, the US president said he would consider an opt-out for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a close Trump ally who has maintained good relations with Russia throughout the Ukraine war.Speaking on Friday during Orban's visit to the White House, Trump said an exemption was under consideration because \"it's very difficult for him [Orban] to get the oil and gas from other areas\". It comes after the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies last month, threatening sanctions on those who buy from them.Following the meeting, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó wrote on X that the US had given Budapest \"a full and unlimited exemption from sanctions on oil and gas\". An official later told the BBC that that exemption was time-limited to one year.This decision by Trump marks a major victory for Orban, who had said the sanctions would ruin his country's economy. During the public part of the meeting, Trump sounded sympathetic to Hungary's position as a landlocked country, dependent on oil and gas from Russia, but stopped short of giving a specific guarantee. But subsequently it became clear that the US president had granted an exemption for one year - seemingly flying in the face of his determination just two weeks ago to penalise anyone who did business with Russia's energy companies. Hungary has agreed to buy several hundred millions of dollars of US natural gas as part of the arrangement, but it is a deal likely to go down badly in many European capitals, most of whom have long opposed Hungary's friendly stance towards Moscow. Orban has long been a close personal and political ally of the president, echoing much of Donald Trump's populist right wing rhetoric over immigration and social issues. That loyalty seems to have earned the Hungarian prime minister some special treatment at a time when he is facing difficult elections in the spring.Trump added that while Hungary faced unique logistical challenges, including access to a sea that could be used to drill oil, he was \"very disturbed\" by other European countries that, he said, continued to buy Russian commodities despite not being landlocked.Orban, who has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine, has defended his energy ties with Russia, saying on Friday that pipelines are neither \"ideological\" nor \"political\", but a \"physical reality\" due to the lack of ports.He has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary. He has promised \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.Trump and Orban also discussed the war in Ukraine on Friday - their first formal meeting since Trump returned to power - including the possibility of holding talks with Putin.\"He [Orban] understands Putin and knows him very well... I think that Viktor feels we're going to get that war ended in the not-too-distant future\", Trump said.The Hungarian leader, meanwhile, claimed that only their two nations truly wanted peace in Ukraine. \"All the other governments prefer to continue the war because many of them think that Ukraine can win on the front line, which is a misunderstanding of the situation.\"Trump asked him: \"So you would say that Ukraine cannot win that war?\" To which Orban replied: \"You know, a miracle can happen.\"Aside from the issue of oil and gas sanctions, Hungary's export-driven car industry has been hit by Trump's tariffs on European goods, adding to an already weak economy. Despite frequent clashes with EU leaders over migration, democracy, and the rule of law, Trump urged Europe to \"respect this leader very, very strongly because he's been right on immigration.\"With additional reporting by Nick Thorpe",

    "body": "A former Israeli hostage who was released last month has told Israeli TV that he was sexually assaulted during his two years in captivity in Gaza.In an interview with Channel 13's Hazinor programme, Rom Braslavski, 21, described being stripped naked and tied up by members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).\"It was sexual violence, and its main purpose was humiliation. Its goal was to humiliate me, to crush my dignity,\" he said.He is the first man held hostage to allege publicly that he was sexually assaulted.Warning: This article contains details some readers may find disturbing.Rom Braslavski was on leave from his service as a soldier in the Israeli military and was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival when Hamas and allied Palestinian armed groups attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages.Israel responded to the attacks by launching a military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 68,800 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Four weeks ago, Mr Braslavski was among the last 20 living Israeli hostages who were released under a US-brokered ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.In the interview with Channel 13, broadcast late on Thursday, Mr Braslavski said his treatment by PIJ deteriorated rapidly after he had refused to convert from Judaism to Islam in March this year, which was also when the previous ceasefire collapsed.He said he was kept blindfolded for three weeks, had stones pushed into his ears to limit his hearing, and had his rations of food and water reduced.Then, he added, his captors received what they described as an order to torture him.Mr Braslavski said they tied him up, punched him, and whipped him with a metal cable – and that this was repeated several times a day.\"I entered into a loop, which I doubted I would come out of alive,\" he recalled.In August 2025, PIJ posted a video in which Mr Braslavski was seen crying and saying that he had run out of food and water, was unable to stand or walk, and was \"at death's door\".Following the publication of the video, Mr Braslavski told Channel 13, his captors also began to sexually assault him.\"They stripped me of all my clothes, my underwear, everything. They tied me up from the... When I was completely naked I was wiped out, dying without food and I prayed to God: 'Save me, get me out of this already',\" he said.When asked whether his captors did \"more things like that\", Mr Braslavski replied: \"Yes. It's hard for me to talk about this part specifically. I don't like to talk about it. And it's hard. It was a horrific thing.\"He added: \"You just pray to God for it to stop. And while I was there, every day, every beating, every day, I'd say to myself: 'I survived another day in hell. Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up to another hell. And another hell'.\"Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Mr Braslavski had shown \"extraordinary courage in sharing the horrors of his captivity, including a horrific sexual assault he endured\".\"The world must understand the scale of the crimes committed by the terrorists in Gaza, heinous cruelty, sexual violence, and abuse,\" he wrote on X.At least four women held as hostages have spoken publicly about alleged incidents of sexual abuse against themselves or fellow captives, according to Reuters.A PIJ official told Reuters news agency that Mr Braslavski's allegation of sexual assault was \"incorrect\", without elaborating.The UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict said in March 2024 that she and a team of experts had found \"convincing information\" of rape and sexualised torture being committed against some hostages in Gaza. They also found reasonable grounds to believe that sexual violence occurred in multiple locations, including rape and gang rape, during the 7 October attacks. Hamas said the report's findings were \"baseless\".A separate report by a UN commission of inquiry in March 2025 concluded that Israel had \"increasingly employed sexual, reproductive and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians\", including \"forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, as well as sexual assault\". Israel called the allegations \"unfounded\".Last week, the former top lawyer in the Israeli military resigned after saying she was responsible for the leaking of a video that purportedly shows soldiers abusing a Palestinian detainee at a base in Israel last year. The detainee was treated for severe injuries after allegedly being stabbed in the rectum. Five soldiers have been charged over the incident.",

    "body": "27 minutes agoMadeline Halpert and Christal HayesNobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th Century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside British scientist Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology.But Watson's reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex. In a TV programme, he made claims about genes causing a difference in average IQ between black and white people.His death was confirmed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked and researched for decades, before having to resign as its chancellor over the comments.Watson shared the Nobel in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick for the DNA's double helix structure discovery.\"We have discovered the secret of life,\" they said at the time. By the early 2000s, he had been largely ostracised by the scientific community over his comments on race and gender.In 2007, the scientist told the Times newspaper that he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\", because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really\".He apologised \"unreservedly\", but nevertheless, the comments led to him losing his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.Additional comments he made in 2019 - when he once again suggested a link between race and intelligence - led to the lab stripping his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee.\"Dr Watson's statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science,\" the laboratory said in a statement at the time.DNA was discovered in 1869 but it took until 1943 for scientists to discover that it made up the genetic material in cells. Still, the structure of DNA remained a mystery. Working with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule. Maurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure. Franklin, who died in 1958, is today recognised for the integral role she played in the scientific breakthrough of DNA research, despite her work largely being written out of the story at the time.Former colleagues have commented that Watson nurtured the careers of female scientists at Harvard in the 1950s and 60s, at a time when that was not the norm. However he also made disparaging comments about women in science, and wrote sexist remarks about Franklin, including commenting on her appearance, in his 1968 best-selling book, The Double Helix.Watson became the first living Nobel laureate to sell his gold medal, fetching $4.8m (£3.6m) at an auction in 2014, saying he was letting go of it because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his controversial remarks.A Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him.James Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers.He won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15.  There, he became interested in the new technique of diffraction, in which X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures.To pursue his research into DNA structures, he went to Cambridge University in England, where he met Crick, with whom he began constructing large-scale models of possible structures.Later, after his scientific discovery, Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard, where he became professor of biology. The couple had two sons - one of whom was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, further motivating Watson's research to learn more about DNA in the hope of possibly helping him.In 1968, he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an old institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes.",

    "body": "19 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,Nairobi and Mayeni Jones,PretoriaExplosions have been heard near the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) said it would agree to a humanitarian ceasefire.Residents in Khartoum, which is controlled by the army, told the AFP news agency that they were woken overnight by the sound of drones and explosions.The blasts appeared to take place near a military base and a power station in the early hours of Friday morning, the residents said.The RSF has not addressed these accounts, but Sudan's military-led government said it would be wary of agreeing to a truce as the group did not \"respect\" ceasefires.The two sides have been embroiled in a civil war that has killed at least 150,000 people and forced 12 million others from their homes since it erupted in April 2023.This week a UN-backed global hunger monitor confirmed that famine conditions were spreading in conflict zones.On Friday, drones were heard not only in Khartoum, but also 300km (186 miles) north of the city, in the military-controlled town of Atbara.\"Anti-aircraft defences shot them down, but I saw fires breaking out and heard sounds of explosions in the east of the city,\" a resident there told AFP.The day before, the RSF announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by the US, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Egypt.The four countries put forward the plan in September - and said it should be followed by a permanent ceasefire and a transition to civilian rule.At the time the Sudanese government rejected \"foreign interference\" and any attempts that equated it with a \"racist terrorist militia that relies on foreign mercenaries\".It is not clear if the proposal has been modified since then.But during a press conference on Friday, Sudan's ambassador to South Africa said it was too early for his country to agree to the plan.\"From our experience, we had many truces at the beginning of the war but every time there was no respect from [the RSF],\" Osman Abufatima Adam Mohammed said.\"They use these truces to move to new areas and make moves against the government.\"The ambassador opposed the UAE's presence at the ceasefire talks, repeating his government's allegation that the Gulf nation was supplying the RSF with weapons and foreign fighters.UN experts say accusations of such military support are credible, but the UAE has denied all involvement with the RSF.The RSF and the military have agreed to ceasefire proposals before, but none have stuck.This time, the RSF waited until it had finally seized el-Fasher, a key city that it had been blockading for 18 months, before announcing it was on board with the truce.Now that the paramilitary group has consolidated control over el-Fasher and, consequently, the vast wider western region of Darfur, it may have greater leverage in future ceasefire negotiations.But the RSF is also facing an international backlash against widespread reports of mass killings and sexual violence during the fall of el-Fasher, which it has denied.",

The strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. Thousands of people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings as the army was deployed to help deal with the damage. Vietnamese authorities have warned of possible flooding in low-lying areas. Central Vietnam has already seen record rainfall in the past week which has killed 50 people.Earlier this week the same storm devastated parts of the Philippines when heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods. The death toll reported on Friday was a jump from the 114 reported the previous day. Another 135 people are listed as missing. The Philippines government has declared a state of calamity across the country as it prepares for another typhoon which is building up in the Pacific Ocean.Ahead of Typhoon Kalmaegi, Vietnam's military on Thursday deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel for relief efforts, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and six aircraft. Some airports and expressways in the country were closed and hundreds of thousands were evacuated.Shortly after the typhoon made landfall at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT), hundreds of residents in Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported.Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.Many people said their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area.AFP via Getty ImagesTrees came down in high winds near Quy Nhon beach in Gia Lai, central Vietnam, as Kalmaegi approached on ThursdayAccording to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response.\"We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,\" he was quoted as saying.\"No one should be left hungry or cold.\" Before making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines.At least 188 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month's worth of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier.In Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction, Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home.\"We don't have any home anymore,\" she told the BBC. \"We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. \"We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different.\"Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.EPAPeople have been sheltering in evacuation centres after flooding destroyed homes in Cebu, Philippines this week",

    "body": "6 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesHarvard has been a central target in the White House's campaign to stamp out what it calls \"woke\" ideologies on American campusesUS President Donald Trump announced he will be seeking $1bn (£730m) in damages from Harvard University in his administration's ongoing feud with the institution.The news comes after the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had to backtrack from its demand for a $200m payment in negotiations with the university.Trump cited the story in a Truth Social post late on Monday, blaming Harvard for \"feeding a lot of nonsense\" to the New York Times.Trump officials have accused Harvard of not doing enough to tackle antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard has rejected the accusation.Harvard has been a central target in the White House's campaign to stamp out what it calls \"woke\" and \"radical left\" ideologies on American campuses.In April last year, Trump revoked around $2bn in research grants to Harvard and froze federal funding.The university sued the Trump administration over the move, saying no government \"should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue\".A US federal court later overturned the billions in funding cuts, ruling the government had violated university's free speech rights.The White House vowed to immediately challenge the \"egregious decision\", saying Harvard remains \"ineligible for grants in the future\".Before Monday's announcement, the government had been in discussions with Harvard over a potential deal to unfreeze federal funding. \"We are now seeking One Billion Dollars in damages, and want nothing further to do, into the future, with Harvard University,\" Trump wrote on Monday.He accused Harvard of \"serious and heinous illegalities\", but did not clarify how he believed it had broken the law.  Trump has previously threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and take control of the university's patents stemming from federally funded research.Three other Ivy League universities, Columbia, Penn and Brown, struck deals with Trump to preserve funding that was at risk due to similar claims by the administration, rather than go to court.",

    "body": "11 hours agoPeter HoskinsAFP via Getty ImagesChina has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.It comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.Under the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media. The new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle. Inside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.  Cars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.Hidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.They feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.Although the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.Tesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.In November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.The NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.In four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

    "body": "13 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesFederal immigration agents deployed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, will soon receive body cameras, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says.The announcement comes as the government faces a backlash over the deaths last month of two US citizens - Alex Pretti and Renee Good - following a surge of federal immigration officers into the Minneapolis area as part of an immigration crackdown.\"Effective immediately we are deploying body cameras to every officer in the field in Minneapolis,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X on Monday. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner has ruled Pretti's 24 January death a homicide. Homicide refers to the killing of a person by another person. It does not necessarily signify that a crime has occurred.Monday's report by the medical examiner said Pretti had suffered \"multiple gunshot wounds\" fired by one or more law enforcement officers.It added that he died in the emergency room at the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. No further details were noted.According to US Customs and Border Protection, the two agents involved in Pretti's death wore body cameras. They have been placed on leave, the agency said.The US Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into Pretti's death.Noem said once funding is available, the body camera programme will be expanded nationwide. The US is currently on day three of a partial government shutdown as Democrats continue to demand immigration reforms, including body cameras, as part of any funding deal to reopen the government.Immigration and Customs Enforcement is currently the highest funded US law enforcement agency, after Congress authorised $80bn (£59bn) for the agency last year.Asked about Noem's announcement, President Donald Trump said that body cameras \"generally tend to be good for law enforcement because people can't lie about what's happening\". \"Generally speaking, I think it's 80% good for law enforcement,\" he said. In the wake of Pretti's shooting, the Trump administration removed Gregory Bovino, the US border patrol chief, from Minneapolis and replaced him with border tsar Tom Homan. Last week Homan met local leaders, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Michael Frey, to discuss calming tensions in the wake of Pretti and Good's deaths. Walz and Frey have called for a withdrawal of federal agents entirely from the state's capital region.After his arrival, Homan said that authorities were working on a plan to \"draw down\" federal agents in Minneapolis, but that changes in the operation would depend on how much state and local officials co-operate with federal authorities. The administration has criticised Minneapolis for having a \"sanctuary city policy\" that bars city employees from enforcing immigration laws.Frey told the New York Times that he wants Minneapolis police officers \"doing the important work of keeping Minneapolis residents safe\". But he has said the city will work with federal authorities in certain situations.More than 3,000 federal immigration officers have been in the state of Minnesota for weeks as part of a federal immigration surge ordered by Trump, who campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration.Bloomberg via Getty Images",

    "body": "Paris prosecutors raid France offices of Elon Musk's X16 minutes agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe French offices of Elon Musk's X have been raided by the Paris prosecutor's cyber-crime unit, as part of an investigation into suspected offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.The prosecutor's office said the probe began in January 2025 when it started looking into content recommended by the social media platform's algorithm, before being widened to include its controversial AI chatbot, Grok.In a statement, it added that both Musk and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino had been summoned to appear at hearings in April.X has yet to comment but has previously characterised the investigation as an attack on free speech. The BBC has approached the company for a response.X previously described the widening of the probe, in July 2025, in a post at the time, as \"politically-motivated\" and denied allegations it had manipulated its algorithm.Prosecutors say they are now investigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas.Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people's image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group.The prosecutor's office also said it was leaving X and would communicate on LinkedIn and Instagram from now on.Musk's social media platform has recently been subject to intense scrutiny over sexualised images generated and edited on the site using its AI tool Grok.The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a barrage of criticism from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians.In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as \"a matter of urgency\".It added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because of limitations in the law in terms of its powers relating to chatbots.However, another regulator - the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) - said it was launching its own probe, in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok.\"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,\" said William Malcom, Executive Director Regulatory Risk & Innovation at the ICO.Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities, accusing France of being \"the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom\". \"Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country,\" he added in a post on X.Durov was arrested and detained in France in August 2024 over alleged moderation lapses on his messaging app, which the Paris prosecutor's office said had failed to curb criminal activity.He was permitted to leave the country last March after the platform made some changes to the way it operates following the arrest.",

India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is investigating the crash and a final report is expected to be released in a few months.Air India crash plane had record of safety defects, campaigners claimWhy cockpit audio deepens the mystery of Air India crashIndia's aviation regulator had also ordered an investigation of cockpit fuel switches in Boeing 787 and Boeing 737 aircraft operating in the country after the crash. Air India had said then that its inspections did not find any issue with the locking mechanism of the switch, which it reiterated on Monday.  \"Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation], and had found no issues,\" the airline said in the statement.On Tuesday, Reuters news agency reported that Air India had begun re-checking the fuel switches on its Boeing Dreamliner aircraft following the incident flagged by the pilot.Aviation consultant and former air accident investigator Tim Atkinson told the BBC that he trusted Boeing's design of the fuel control switches.\"These switches are designed with one purpose in mind, and that is that they cannot be moved unintentionally. There is no doubt in my mind that the design is good. I would be astonished to find it had some kind of latent defect,\" he said.With additional reporting from Theo Leggett for BBC News.",

    "body": "3 hours agoOttilie MitchellIran's Presidential website/WANA/ReutersIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said Iran will pursue negotiations with the US after requests from \"friendly governments in the region\" to respond to a US proposal for talks.In a statement on X, Pezeshkian said he had told Iran's Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi to pursue talks \"provided that a suitable environment exists - one free from threats and unreasonable expectations\".The Iranian president's words come after the country's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned any attack on Iran would spark a regional conflict. US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran over its nuclear ambitions and deadly crackdown on protesters, building up forces nearby.\"These negotiations shall be conducted within the framework of our national interests\", Pezeshkian added. The talks will be held in Istanbul on Friday, according to US media reports. Pezeshkian's announcement follows an interview with Araghchi in which he told CNN he was \"confident that we can achieve a deal\".Speaking to a press pool in the White House, Trump said on Monday \"if we can work something out\" that would be \"great\", but warned that \"bad things would happen\" if not.The US carried out targeted strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year in what it called Operation Midnight Hammer. The strikes followed a large-scale operation by Israel to target Iran's nuclear facilities and nuclear scientists. Trump added that there was a \"tremendous force\" headed to Iran, including the \"biggest and the best\" ships. The build up of US military and navy includes air craft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which has an air wing of around 70 aircraft. Iranian authorities previously said that 3,117 people were killed during the protests, but activist and monitoring groups say the toll is significantly higher. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the deaths of 6,430 protesters, 152 children and 214 people associated with the government. It is still investigating some 11,280 cases. Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) said the final toll could exceed 25,000.The widespread demonstrations were sparked by economic frustrations in the country but developed into demands for political change. Iranian officials have told Khamenei that public anger following the protests has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent, Reuters news agency reports.More on this story",

There are no suggestions he ever visited Epstein's private island and he has not been accused of any crime by Epstein's victims.  The US justice department has said allegations about him are unfounded and false.Trump responded to Noah's joke by saying he would be \"sending my lawyers to sue\". Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!!\"I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.\"Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.\"He added: \"Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!\"Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor.He had purchased his private island in 1998. Multiple survivors have alleged that they were trafficked there and abused. Trump has engaged in legal action with multiple media organisations in recent years, including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.In December, he filed a multi-billion dollar lawsuit in a Florida court accusing the BBC of defamation and of violating a trade practices law over the editing of a Panorama programme.Noah is a South African-born comedian who hosted The Daily Show on Comedy Central in the US for seven years.

He has campaigned for more autonomy for Tibet, but Beijing considers it an integral part of China.In a message on social media the Dalai Lama, who is also a Nobel peace laureate, said: \"I receive this recognition with gratitude and humility.\"I don't see it as something personal, but as a recognition of our shared universal responsibility.\"The award was collected on his behalf by musician Rufus Wainwright, who was among the artists to feature on the audiobook.Getty ImagesRufus Wainwright collected the award on behalf of the Tibetan spiritual leaderLast year the Dalai Lama confirmed plans to name a successor, which has caused further friction with China. According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after death - a process deeply rooted in spiritual customs, not political authority.He has previously said his reincarnation will take place in the \"free world\", meaning outside of atheist and communist China but Beijing swiftly rejected his authority to determine a successor.Chinese officials insist that any succession must follow Chinese laws, religious rituals and historical conventions - and ultimately be approved by the government in Beijing.The announcement has reignited fears among Tibetans in exile that China will attempt to name a successor to tighten control over Tibet, the region it occupied in 1950 and has ruled ever since.",

    "body": "1 day agoMadina MaishanuBBC Africa, AbujaBBCThe chairs strewn across the floor of one of the churches raided last month hints at the panic the attack caused Dozens of worshippers kidnapped by gunmen in Nigeria's northern Kaduna state have returned home weeks after their abduction, police have confirmed.They were among 177 people seized last month from three churches in the remote village of Kurmin Wali.The 80 people escaped on the day they were taken but hid in neighbouring villages for a fortnight \"due to fear of being captured again\", state police spokesman Mansur Hassan told the BBC.The authorities say efforts are ongoing to secure the release of the remaining 86 people still being held. The attack was part of a wave of kidnappings for ransom affecting many parts of Nigeria, but no group has said it was behind the abductions.The raid was initially denied by police, who only confirmed the kidnappings on 21 January after local residents had reported to the BBC that 177 worshippers were abducted, with 11 escaping shortly afterwards.The official response drew criticism from Amnesty International, which accused Nigerian authorities of \"desperate denial\".The rights group urged officials to \"take immediate and concrete measures to prevent rampant abductions that are gradually becoming the norm in Nigeria.\"In November, more than 300 students and teachers were taken from a Catholic school in Niger state, which neighbours Kaduna, before being released in two groups.Nigeria faces multiple, overlapping security challenges beyond kidnappings, including an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and frequent clashes between herders and farmers in central regions over land and water.Security experts say efforts to tackle these crises are hampered by corruption, poor intelligence sharing, and underfunded local police forces.The security situation has drawn international attention. In December, the US conducted airstrikes in north-western Nigeria on Christmas Day, targeting two camps run by an Islamist militant group.Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is home to more than 250 ethnic groups and is roughly divided between a predominantly Muslim north and a largely Christian south, with significant mixing in central regions. The government maintains that people of all faiths have been victims of the widespread violence.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "4 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Why is no one being prosecuted over the Epstein files?Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, have agreed to testify in the congressional investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It comes days before a vote on whether to hold the couple in criminal contempt for refusing to appear before the House Oversight Committee after a months-long standoff.  Bill Clinton was acquainted with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, but has denied knowledge of his sex offending and says he cut off contact two decades ago. It's unclear when the depositions will take place, but it will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.The Clintons had long resisted a demand to appear before the committee, saying they had already given sworn statements representing the \"limited information\" they had on Epstein.They had dismissed the legal summonses issued by the committee as \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".The House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans, then approved the measure to hold the Clintons in contempt late last month, with the support of several Democrats.On Saturday, lawyers for the couple made an offer for them to provide limited testimony that would have centred on a four-hour interview by Bill Clinton. But House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer expressed concerns that the former president would stonewall questions and run down the clock.On Monday evening, Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña posted on X confirming the couple would appear before the panel.\"They negotiated in good faith,\" Ureña wrote in a tweet directed at the House Oversight Committee. \"You did not. \"They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"Afterwards, it was announced that lawmakers' consideration of the contempt resolutions against the Clintons would be postponed. House Rules Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx said the Oversight Committee needed more time \"to clarify with the Clintons what they are actually agreeing to\".For his part, Comer said: \"I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.\"Neither Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and they have denied knowledge of his sex offending.Hillary Clinton, former US senator and secretary of state, and the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, has said she never met or spoke to Epstein.US Department of JusticeBill Clinton in a hot tub, in the Epstein filesEpstein's private jet logs show that Clinton took four international flights in 2002 and 2003.Shortly after Epstein was arrested on sex trafficking charges in July 2019, Clinton's spokesperson said the former president took trips on the plane including \"stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation\".The former president also appears at the late financier's estate in photos that were among a batch of records released by the justice department to comply with a law passed by Congress mandating the disclosure of all investigative material relating to the late convicted paedophile.One picture shows the former president swimming in a pool, and another shows him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Ureña, Clinton's spokesman, said at the time the photos were released in December that they were decades old and Clinton had stopped associating with Epstein before his crimes came to light.Watch: What's in the latest batch of released Epstein files?Last month, the Clintons wrote a letter to James Comer, the House Oversight Committee chairman, criticising his handling of the Epstein investigation. \"The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government's role,\" the letter said. They added: \"There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics.\"Comer previously noted the subpoenas to the Clintons were approved in a bipartisan vote and said \"no-one is above the law\".\"We communicated with President Clinton's legal team for months now, giving them opportunity after opportunity to come in, to give us a day, and they continue to delay, delay, delay,\" said the Kentucky Republican.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoSarah RainsfordEastern and Southern Europe correspondent in KyivAFP via Getty ImagesKyiv residents shelter at a train station during Russian air raidsRussia has launched its \"most powerful blow\" against Ukraine's energy sector so far this year, according to the private energy company, DTEK.The combined missile and drone strikes which targeted power plants and infrastructure in Kyiv and multiple locations left the system operating with \"serious restrictions\", it said.The strikes were launched as temperatures dropped to -20C  (-4F) and left more than 1,000 tower blocks in the capital without heating once again and damaged a power plant in the eastern city of Kharkiv beyond repair.President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was \"choosing terror and escalation\" rather than diplomacy to end this war and called for \"maximum pressure\" on Moscow from Ukraine's allies.The attack comes after a so-called \"energy truce\" agreed by Donald Trump with Vladimir Putin expired at the weekend.It also came on the day Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte was in Kyiv to meet President Zelensky and to address the national parliament.Donald Trump's initiative was meant to give diplomacy a chance. Negotiators from Russia and Ukraine are due to meet in Abu Dhabi for another round of talks co-ordinated by the US later this week.It is clear that Russia has other ideas.And in fact, there is always a gap between Russia's massive strikes which makes Ukrainians doubt there was ever any real pause at all.We heard the first explosions in Kyiv soon after midnight and the air raid lasted more than seven hours. There were several subsequent blasts.Residents spent the night sheltering in metro stations, with some pitching tents on the platforms to protect them from the freezing cold.President Zelensky has said more than 70 ballistic and cruise missiles were fired - significantly more than usual - together with 450 drones which are used to overwhelm Ukraine's air defences.Ukraine's Air Force said it had intercepted only 38 of the missiles, which means many reached their target.Officials here have complained repeatedly of a shortage of missiles to protect the skies. Ukraine relies on US-made Patriot missiles, in particular.\"Timely delivery of missiles for air defense systems and the protection of normal life are our priority,\" Zelenksy wrote on X this morning. \"Without pressure on Russia, there will be no end to this war.\"ReutersPolice officer carries a part of a Russian drone at the site of a residential building in Kyiv on 3 February, 2026Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of using the coldest days of winter to \"terrorise people\".DTEK has confirmed that two of its own power plants were hit again overnight, including in Odesa, in what it says was the ninth massive attack on the sector since October.State-run facilities were hit in Kyiv, Dnipro and elsewhere, adding to serious damage caused by a series of previous targeted attacks.DTEK says some of the plants targeted were providing heating only, not electricity, which means they were exclusively for civilian use. The Geneva Convention makes clear that targeting civilian infrastructure is a potential war crime.Each time makes it harder to carry out repairs and leaves the system more fragile, and prone to blackouts. Teams of engineers have been working through the night for weeks to fix things - drafted in from all over the country and hailed as heroes.But there are not enough workers to keep up with demand.We have met residents who have had no heating in their homes for days, in some cases weeks. They sleep in hats and coats, and under piles of blankets, but it is still bitterly cold.Many use soup kitchens to get free hot meals because there are also power cuts here for hours on end.People believe these attacks are intended to turn them against the authorities in Kyiv, to make their lives so miserable they submit to Russia's demands - including to hand over land in the eastern Donbas region that Moscow currently does not control.Instead, there is a lot of anger here at Russia for attempting to freeze civilians in their homes as well as resistance to any form of compromise with Moscow.\"Russia won't get what it wants,\" Vera told the BBC this weekend, as she queued for a bowl of stew served by volunteers. \"We are stronger than them in any case.\"Volodymyr said he planned to sleep in a local school for a few days, which has a generator to keep it warm. \"In the daytime you move around a bit,\" he said. \"But at night it's really cold.\"He was furious with Russia. \"They are bombing civilians. They want us to freeze and die,\" he said.Several residential buildings were damaged in the latest attack and set on fire by falling debris as Ukraine shot down missiles and drones. Several people were injured.More on this story",

    "body": "Ukraine hails 'real results' after Musk restricts Russian Starlink use21 hours agoLaura GozziReutersElon Musk's efforts to stop Russia from using Starlink satellites for drone attacks have \"delivered real results\", a Ukrainian official said.Praising the SpaceX founder as \"a true champion of freedom and a true friend of the Ukrainian people\", defence minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Musk had swiftly responded when he was told Russian drones with Starlink connectivity were operating in the country.\"Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorised use of Starlink by Russia have worked,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Let us know if more needs to be done.\"The Russian drones are difficult to shoot down, Fedorov said, as they fly at low altitudes, cannot be countered with electronic warfare, and are controlled by operators in real time from a distance.The Institute for the Study of War warned in mid-January that since Russia had begun equipping the cheap kamikaze Molniya-2 drones with Starlink, their battlefield efficiency had increased \"dramatically\".While neither Fedorov nor Musk elaborated on what the response had been, the defence ministry's official website ArmiyaInform reported that SpaceX had introduced a speed limit of 75kph on Starlink terminals moving over Ukraine.\"Russian drones move much more quickly, so the enemy operators will not be able to control them in real time,\" the website said.Telegram/Serhiy BeskrestnovEarlier in January Serhiy Beskrestnov, an adviser to Mykhailo Fedorov, said a Starlink terminal had been found on a BM-35 kamikaze droneOn Monday Fedorov said the Ukrainian government was also preparing to implement a white list of approved Starlink satellite terminals which could operate in Ukraine. All unregistered terminals will be disconnected, Fedorov said.\"We are implementing this in cooperation with SpaceX,\" Fedorov stated, adding that instructions on registering the terminals would be forthcoming.Russian war bloggers warned the implications could go beyond drones, as the Russian military uses Starlink to provide the front line with internet.Fedorov - then deputy prime minister - asked for Musk's help soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. By the end of the day Musk said Starlink had been enabled in Ukraine and promised more satellite dishes.But shortly after supplying Ukraine with Starlink, Musk's relationship with Kyiv became turbulent. Later in 2022 he denied the Ukrainian military access to Starlink in Crimea, where Russia has been stationing military equipment since illegally annexing in 2014.At the time, Musk justified the decision by saying that Ukraine would have used Starlink access to \"sink most of the Russian fleet\", making SpaceX \"complicit in a major act of war\".Musk has since repeatedly criticised Western countries for providing Ukraine with funding and weaponry. \"It is insane to keep sending so much money to Ukraine with no accountability and no end game,\" he said.However, he has also stated that \"no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals.\"\"My Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off,\" Musk said in March.Despite these tensions, Fedorov last week again praised Musk's timely decision to provide his country with access at the start of the full-scale invasion, saying Starlink had been \"critically important for the stability of our state\".The 35-year-old former digital transformation minister was appointed to head the ministry of defence by President Volodymyr Zelensky last month.Fedorov favours a data-driven strategy and advanced cyber-warfare. He has also vowed to work closely with Silicon Valley companies, arguing that integrating partners would make Ukraine's defence system stronger.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring",

    "body": "Ukraine's sports minister has called Fifa president Gianni Infantino \"irresponsible\" and \"infantile\" for saying that world football's governing body will look at lifting a ban on Russia.Russian national teams and clubs were suspended from all competitions by Fifa and Uefa in February 2022 after the country's invasion of Ukraine.With the war still going on, Infantino has said \"this ban has not achieved anything\" and \"has just created more frustration and hatred\".He added: \"Having girls and boys from Russia being able to play football games in other parts of Europe would help.\"In response, Ukraine sports minister Matvii Bidnyi said in a social media post:, external \"Gianni Infantino's words sound irresponsible - not to say infantile.  \"They detach football from the reality in which children are being killed.\"Let me remind you that since the start of Russia's full-scale aggression, more than 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russians. Among them were more than one hundred footballers.\"Infantino was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship medal by president Vladimir Putin after Russia hosted the 2018 World Cup.However, since Russia's ban, they have been unable to compete at the 2022 World Cup and and Uefa's Euro 2024 and the country will not be part of the 2026 World Cup.Russia has not completely stopped playing international footbal as they have played matches against non-Western nations without needing the permission of Fifa or Uefa.\"War is a crime, not politics,\" added Bidnyi. \"It is Russia that politicises sport and uses it to justify aggression. \"I share the position of the Ukrainian Association of Football, which also warns against Russia's return to international competitions.\"As long as Russians continue killing Ukrainians and politicising sport, their flag and national symbols have no place among people who respect values such as justice, integrity and fair play.\"Last year, Ukraine criticised the International Paralympic Committee's (IPC) decision to lift a ban on athletes from Russia and its close ally Belarus.The Ukrainian National Paralympic Committee said the IPC had allowed Russia and Belarus to \"raise their flags, drenched in the blood of hundreds of thousands of people\".Despite the IPC lifting its ban, Russian and Belarusian Para-athletes will not be at next month's Winter Paralympics. Although the IPC oversees the Games, there are four separate governing bodies in charge of the six sports taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.Three of the governing bodies have decided to keep their bans on athletes from the two countries, and although Russia and Belarus are now allowed to compete in ice hockey, the decision came too late for them to take part in qualifying.",

    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJack BurgessGetty ImagesEcuador's president has said someone attempted to poison him by putting three highly concentrated toxic substances in gifts of chocolate and jam.Daniel Noboa said his team had proof to support the claim, though he has yet to publicly provide any evidence.The South American leader told CNN on Thursday that he believed it was \"practically impossible\" that the three chemicals would be found in high concentrations in the items by chance.His comments come in the wake of violent clashes in Ecuador over a sharp rise in fuel prices under his presidency. The centre-right politician has brought in military crackdowns on drug gangs, but has also faced accusations of targeting protesters.Noboa has denied the allegations of attempts on his life - the third in two months - were a means of portraying his detractors as violent.\"No one throws a Molotov cocktail at themselves... or poisons themselves with chocolate, or throws stones at themselves,\" he said, referring to previous incidents.Early in October, Ecuador's government said five people were detained over what it described as an alleged assassination attempt.About 500 people threw rocks at the president's car and there were \"signs of bullet damage\" on his vehicle, according to the country's energy and environment minister, who added that Noboa was unharmed.The BBC was not able to independently confirm that a bullet had been fired.The government also said that, in late September, a humanitarian convoy containing Noboa was attacked and 17 soldiers taken hostage.Ecuadorian officials said the convoy - which included UN and EU diplomats - was delivering aid to communities affected by a national strike when ambushed by about 350 people, who attacked it with Molotov cocktails.Noboa posted photos of smashed windscreens and windows on the cars on social media.A national strike protesting against the government ending diesel subsidies came to a close on Thursday after several weeks.The strike was declared by the country's largest Indigenous organisation - the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) - with marches and roadblocks organised.The Conaie group led demonstrations that overthrew three presidents between 1997 and 2005.",

    "body": "US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Friday that the US had carried out another strike against a ship alleged to belong to drug traffickers.The operation took place in the Caribbean Sea, against a group Hegseth identified as the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation. Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" were on board and killed.The US has carried out a series of strikes on ships in the region, in what President Donald Trump has described as an effort to curtail drug trafficking.Hegseth posted a video on X showing the operation. It begins by showing a boat in crosshairs, before it explodes into a cloud of smoke.This is the tenth strike the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off of South America,  in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic US senators wrote to the White House and alleged the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States.\"Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval.Trump said he has the legal authority to order the strikes, and has designated Tren de Aragua a terrorist organisation.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do (it) by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that \"if people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States\".The six deaths in the operation Hegseth announced Friday brings the total people killed in the US strikes to at least 43.It is still widely believed that these strikes are not only about drug trafficking but also about putting military pressure on the government of President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela.He is a longtime foe of Donald Trump who has long accused him of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, something he denies.",

    "body": "A German company inadvertently embroiled in the Louvre Museum heist after one of its lifts was used in the theft is making the most of its free publicity - by launching a new advertising campaign.Werne-based firm Böcker this week published a social media post featuring the now-famous image of its furniture ladder extending up to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo. \"When you need to move fast,\" reads a banner under the image. \"The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min - quiet as a whisper.\"Video has emerged of the alleged thieves escaping on the mechanical ladder after stealing €88m worth (£76m; $102m) of France's crown jewels on Sunday.The company's managing director, Alexander Böcker, told news agency AFP on Wednesday that, when it became clear no one was injured in the heist, it had used \"a touch of humour\" to draw attention to the family-run business.\"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us,\" Mr Böcker said.\"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company.\" How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Reaction to Böcker's new campaign has been enthusiastic, with responses on social media including \"marketing genius\" and \"excellent, that is German quality\".\"Your messaging takes the crown,\" one commenter quipped.Mr Böcker told AFP that he recognised his company's device from news reports, saying the machine was sold \"a few years ago to a French customer who rents this type of equipment in Paris and the surrounding area\".The alleged jewel thieves had arranged to have the machine demonstrated to them last week and had stolen it during the demonstration, he said.The thieves arrived at the Louvre on Sunday shortly after the museum opened its doors.Within eight minutes, they had made off with some of France's most valuable treasures, including those belonging to former royalty and imperial rulers.Among the eight items stolen were diadems, necklaces, earrings and brooches adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.The Louvre reopened on Wednesday, a few days after what has been called France's most shocking theft.The museum's director admitted on Wednesday that security failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft and that CCTV around its perimeter was weak and \"aging\".\"We failed these jewels,\" Laurence des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she added.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors said they believed the robbers acted under orders from a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "Guineans have reacted with shock after it was announced that presidential candidates would need to pay a deposit of 875m Guinean francs ($100,000; £75,000) to contest December's election, which should see the military leaders hand power to civilians.Guinea has been under military rule since Colonel Mamady Doumbouya seized power in a 2021 coup.The elections are being held under a new constitution that allowed Doumbouya to run for the presidency – although he has not announced if he plans to.While the previous deposit was almost as high - 800m francs - some analysts had hoped it would be reduced to encourage more people to stand in these historic elections.\"This amount is huge,\" political analyst Kabinet Fofana told the BBC. \"This decision adds to the growing criticism against the general direction of elections.\"Candidates who get more than 5% of the vote in the first round of the election will get their deposit repaid.The authorities say the high amount is needed to ensure only credible candidates take part.But presidential candidate Faya Millimono says the deposit used to be much lower.\"Until 2005, the deposit never exceeded 50 million [Guinean francs]. The madness began in 2010, when it was thought necessary to block certain candidates. The amount went from 50 million to 400 million, and today we're talking about 900 million.\"The costs of participating in the elections are some of the highest in the region.In 2022, the Nigerian electoral commission set a fee of 100m naira ($67,000 at the current rate - at the time it was more than $200,000) sparking widespread criticism.In Cameroon, the deposit is $53,000 and Ivory Coast $90,000.The electoral body also set a campaign spending limit of 40bn Guinean francs ($4.6m; £3.5m) per candidate.One candidate believes these amounts \"send a clear signal - only the very wealthy or those who have already benefited from state resources can truly compete\".Some 50 candidates from political parties and 16 independent candidates have been approved so far.The largest opposition parties, the Rally of the People of Guinea (RPG Arc-en-Ciel), led by former President Alpha Condé, and the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG), headed by former Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, are not included on the provisional list but they still have time to register.Guinea is heading into an election without Condé, who was ousted by Doumbouya, as well as Diallo and former Prime Minister Sidya Touré of the Union of Republican Forces (UFR).All three leaders are currently living outside the country.",

    "body": "Luiz Inácio da Silva has announced he will run for a fourth term as Brazil's president in the nation's elections in 2026.The 79-year-old had indicated during his last election campaign that it would be his last - but stressed he did not feel his age in comments during a state visit to Indonesia on Thursday.\"I'm about to turn 80 years old, but you can be sure I have the same energy I had when I was 30. And I will run for a fourth term in Brazil,\" Lula told reporters.The decision to run comes despite Lula suffering health problems in office after winning in the tightest run-off election in the South American nation's history.Already Brazil's oldest president when inaugurated, in December last year he underwent surgery for a brain bleed caused by a blow to the head he sustained in a fall in the presidential palace.The left-wing leader beat then-incumbent Jair Bolsonaro by 51% to 49% in 2022.The right-wing former president is unlikely to be able to challenge Lula again, as he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a military coup aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the last election.The legal case which led to his lengthy sentence has drawn the ire of US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.However, the two described having a \"friendly\" call earlier in October as Lula seeks to reduce those levies, and are expected to meet on Sunday.Lula, who turns 80 on Monday, has himself been imprisoned - for 18 months on corruption charges - but was freed in 2018 after the case was overturned.He has hinted at a possible fourth run for president since returning to office, but had so far stopped short of a formal announcement.Brazil's constitution limits presidents to two consecutive terms. Lula previously served a two-term stint between 2003 and 2011.",

He joined the ghetto uprising as a teenager in 1943, helping to make petrol bombs. Taken prisoner, he survived concentration camps and a death march before the end of World War II. After the war, he became an artist and Holocaust educator. The embassies of Germany and Poland in Israel paid tribute to him on social media. \"He repeatedly risked his life during the Holocaust, fighting for survival and helping other prisoners in the Warsaw Ghetto – even after he was captured by the Nazis and deported to concentration camps,\" the German embassy stated on X.The Polish embassy said Smuss \"lectured youth on the history of Polish Jews and expressed his memories through art. His legacy endures.\"The Polish embassy and the Holocaust Educational Trust, a UK charity, called Smuss the last surviving fighter of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. However, in 2018, Israeli officials and international media, including the BBC, reported that Simcha Rotem, who had just died aged 94, was the last surviving fighter of the uprising.Last month, Germany's ambassador to Israel awarded Smuss with the German Federal Cross of Merit, in recognition of his contribution to Holocaust education and promoting dialogue between the two countries, the embassy said.\"Thousands of people, especially young people in Germany, have learned from his testimonies.\"German Embassy in IsraelThe German ambassador to Israel awarded a medal to Michael Smuss in SeptemberSmuss was born in 1926 in the Free City of Danzig, a city-state that is now Gdansk, Poland. He later moved to Lodz before being deported to the Warsaw Ghetto with his father.Hundreds of thousands of Jews were crammed into the ghetto, where they faced poverty, starvation, disease and cold.Since Smuss spoke German, he was taken outside to work in a factory repairing and repainting helmets, he recounted in a video recorded for the Sumter Museum in the US in 2022.He joined the Jewish Resistance in the ghetto, and he and others started stealing as much paint thinner as possible to make petrol bombs.\"We filled up bottles which were put up on the roofs of all the houses close to the entrance of the ghetto with the expectation that once they're going to come, we'd be throwing them down\", he said.When the Nazis came to empty the camp on 19 April 1943, the uprising began. The resistance fought back with weapons they had exchanged for warm clothes from Italian soldiers who had been sent from Africa to the Russian front.The resistance, which Smuss called \"the greatest uprising in this war against Germany\", lasted 28 days.\"It was very rough... no shower, no food.

As he witnessed people dying on the journey, \"my heart became a stone\", he said.Along the way, the train was stopped by employers looking to retrieve workers that had been taken from their factories. Another German came looking for experienced workers, and Smuss offered himself and those he knew.\"When we left on the train to Treblinka, I was sure that my life was over,\" he told The Jerusalem Post earlier this year. \"But when the train came to a halt, I felt with all of my being that on this day I was not going to die.\"He was moved and endured forced labour at other camps, and finally a death march to Dachau, before his Nazi captors fled incoming American troops.He told The Jerusalem Post that his father was killed trying to escape one camp, while his mother and sister, who had been able to stay in Lodz, survived.Smuss initially returned to Poland, but then moved to the US, where he worked, studied and started a family. After experiencing trauma symptoms, he moved to Israel in 1979 alone to seek help, where he took up art and educating others about the Holocaust. He is survived by his wife.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNardine SaadNBAE via Getty Images / ReutersFormer NBA player Damon Jones (left) and basketball coach Chauncey Billups were arrested in connection with the schemeCelebrities, professional sports stars and wealthy gamblers sat at a table hoping to win big in a game of Texas Hold 'Em.But they didn't know it was nearly impossible. They were \"fishes\" allegedly being targeted by the mafia in an elaborate poker gambling scheme that included X-ray card tables, secret cameras, analysers in chip trays and sunglasses and contact lenses that could read their hand. In what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these \"unwitting\" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25m) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m.The scheme, which US prosecutors described as \"reminiscent of a Hollywood movie\", was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Cosa Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones. FBI director Kash Patel called it a \"mind-boggling\" fraud scheme that cheated victims in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other US cities. Arrests in the scheme were announced on Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, in which professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds. The underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Lucchese and Genovese. A cut of the profits, prosecutors say, helped fund their criminal enterprise. Former professional athletes, described by prosecutors as \"face cards\", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing. Lured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, \"unwitting victim\" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege. Unbeknownst to the lured-in players - referred to in the scheme as a \"fish\" - everyone surrounding them was in on the elaborate scam - from the players to the dealers, even the technology used to shuffle the deck and count the chips, according to a lengthy federal indictment. Sophisticated wireless technology was also used to deceive the players during the games, most commonly in Texas Hold 'Em.What we know about gambling arrestsAn X-ray poker machine was employed to read facedown cards and a rigged card-shuffling machine was also used in the plot, prosecutors sayThe technology was everywhere - an X-ray table that read any face-down card, analysers inside chip trays, a rigged shuffling machine that read cards and predicted who would have the best hand, and pre-marked cards that allowed those wearing special sunglasses and contact lenses to read what was in everyone's hands. Secretive cameras - built into tables and light fixtures - also helped convey information to those helping in the plot, authorities say. Then there was also a sophisticated method of communicating and rigging the game, prosecutors allege. Information from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator - called an \"operator\" by prosecutors - who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - who prosecutors call a \"quarterback\" or \"driver\". That person would then secretly signal to others, prosecutors allege, effectively stealing money and making it impossible for victims to win. Texts from the US justice department's evidence suggest the \"quarterback\" would either touch the $1,000 poker chip, tap his chin, wrist or arm to signal which conspirator had the best hand. If the victim had the best hand, the \"quarterback\" would touch his black chips.The texts also appear to show that at times conspirators agreed to lose some hands in order to keep victims at the gambling table for longer.US Department of JusticeAnother series of texts suggests participants in the scheme avoided suspicion of cheating by swapping in players and losing money to co-conspirators.Authorities estimate that each game would leave a victim out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Prosecutors say the defendants allegedly laundered the funds from the scheme through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges and shell companies. A cut of the profits went to those who helped in the plot, prosecutors say, and some allegedly went to fund the mafia's criminal enterprise. \"This alleged scheme wreaked havoc across the nation, exploiting the notoriety of some and the wallets of others to finance the Italian crime families,\" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia.Billups, who was accused of being a face card in the fixed card games, was arrested in Portland and was placed on leave by the NBA. The Portland Trail Blazers said in a statement that they were aware of the allegations involving their head coach and were \"fully co-operating with the investigation\".Jones was arrested in relation to both the poker and NBA injuries scheme. He is charged with two counts each of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.",

    "body": "22 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia EditorSputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via Reuters and ReutersOne week ago I had the distinct feeling it was Groundhog Day, or as the Russians call it, Dyen Surka.Amid US threats to pressure Moscow - by supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine - Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump held a telephone call. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Budapest.Last August, amid threats of additional US sanctions against Russia, Putin met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Alaska.Déjà vu.But Groundhog Day seems to be over.The Alaska meeting went ahead, with minimal preparation and little result.But the Budapest summit is off. It barely had time to be \"on\", to be fair. Now President Trump has cancelled it.\"It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get,\" the US president told reporters.And that's not all.Previously, Trump had not followed through on threats of more pressure on Russia, preferring carrots to sticks in his dealings with the Kremlin.For the moment he has put his carrots away. Instead he's imposed sanctions on two major Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. That's unlikely to force a U-turn on the war from President Putin. But it's a sign of Trump's frustration with the Kremlin's unwillingness to make any compromise or concessions to end the fighting in Ukraine.Trump says Putin talks 'don't go anywhere' as he imposes new sanctionsWhat's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?The Russians don't take kindly to sticks.On Thursday, President Putin told reporters that the new US sanctions were an \"unfriendly act\" and an attempt to put pressure on Russia.\"But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decide anything under pressure.\"Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was less diplomatic.\"The USA is our enemy and their talkative 'peacemaker' has now fully set on the path to war with Russia,\" he wrote on social media. \"The decisions that have been taken are an act of war against Russia.\"Thursday morning's edition of the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets was slightly less dramatic, but obviously unflattering. The paper criticised \"the capriciousness and fickleness of [Russia's] main negotiating partner.\"So what's changed?Instead of rushing off to summit no. 2, as he had done for summit no.1, this time around President Trump was slightly more cautious. He had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lay the groundwork for the summit with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to make sure there was a point in decamping to Budapest.It soon became clear that there wasn't, and that a new summit now was unlikely to produce a breakthrough. Russia is fiercely opposed to Donald Trump's idea of freezing the current battle lines in Ukraine. The Kremlin is determined to take control, at the very least, of the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It has seized and occupied much of it. But President Volodymyr Zelensky is refusing to cede to Russia those parts of the Donbas that Ukraine still controls.ReutersMembers of Russia's National Guard patrol Red Square near St. Basil's Cathedral in central Moscow on 23 OctoberMoscow would have welcomed a second US-Russia summit. The first, in Alaska, was a diplomatic and political coup for the Kremlin. The red-carpet welcome in Anchorage for President Putin symbolised Russia's return to the international stage and the West's failure to isolate Moscow. Over the last week Russian state media have been savouring the idea of a summit with President Trump in Europe, but without the European Union at the table. Russian commentators portrayed the proposed meeting in Budapest as a slap in the face for Brussels.At the same time, few here seemed to believe that, even if it went ahead, the Budapest summit would produce the kind of result Moscow wanted. Some Russian newspapers have been calling for the Russian army to continue fighting.\"There isn't a single reason Moscow should agree to a ceasefire,\" declared Moskovsky Komsomolets yesterday.That doesn't mean the Kremlin doesn't want peace.It does. But only on its terms. And right now those are unacceptable to Kyiv and, it would appear, to Washington. Those terms involve more than just territory. Moscow is demanding that what it calls the \"root causes\" of the Ukraine war be addressed: an all-encompassing phrase with which Russia broaden its demands to include a halt to Nato enlargement eastwards. Moscow is also widely believed to retain the goal of forcing Ukraine back into Russia's orbit.Is Donald Trump ready to increase the pressure on Russia even more?Possibly.But it's also possible we may wake up one morning and find ourselves back in Groundhog Day.\"In the game of Trump tug-of-war, Russia is leading again,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets after the Budapest summit had been announced. \"In the couple of weeks before the meeting in Budapest, Trump will be pulled in the opposite direction by telephone calls and visits from Europe. Then Putin will pull him back to our side again.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesThe radio address made by former President Ronald Reagan focused on the impact of tariffsUS President Donald Trump has said he will halt all trade negotiations with Canada immediately over an advert in which his predecessor Ronald Reagan says tariffs \"hurt every American\".The ad, sponsored by Canada's province of Ontario and released last week, features excerpts of an address Reagan gave in 1987 focusing on foreign trade.Trump called the advert \"FAKE\" while The Ronald Reagan Foundation said it \"misrepresents\" the former president's address. While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does however alter the order in which he made the comments.Below are the lines from the advert in italics, followed by an explanation of how they appear (indicated in bold) in the original address.\"When someone says, 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time.\"This is the opening line of the minute-long advert. The words have not been altered.But it is not until about halfway through his original address that Reagan speaks these lines.The 1987 radio speech - Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade - begins with Reagan saying Japan's prime minister will visit the White House and \"recent disagreements\" on trade will be discussed. Reagan had recently placed tariffs on some Japanese goods over a trade agreement dispute.By the time he reaches the advert's opening line, he has set out his aversion to tariffs, described the \"prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring\", and said high tariff legislation made the Great Depression even worse.\"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\"In the advert, these words immediately follow the first line. Again, Reagan did speak these words.However, in the original address the two sentences are not connected. In fact they are separated by more than a minute of speech, and the \"Over the long run..\" line actually comes first.After introducing the Japanese state visit, Reagan starts to explain why he recently introduced the tariffs.He says in the original speech: \"Imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take. And in a moment I'll mention the sound economic reasons for this: that over the long run such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.\"Reagan says some companies had been \"engaging in unfair trade practices\" and going against an agreement with the US - and that this was therefore a \"special case\".This sets the tone for the rest of the address, which he dedicates to making clear his commitment to free trade and the dangers of high tariffs.\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.\"This is the advert's third line, and again these are Reagan's words. But again, in the original speech they do not follow straight on from the previous line in the advert. There is about one minute separating them in the address.In the 1987 speech he says this line in the middle of his address while describing what he sees as the consequences of tariffs. He says:\"What eventually occurs is: First, homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs. They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need to succeed in world markets. And then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs. High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.\"\"Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"Reagan does say this line after the previous one - but the advert cuts out a few sentences separating them.Here is the full run from one to the next in the original: \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.\"So, soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying. Then the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.\"\"Throughout the world, there's a growing realisation that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition.\"Here, the advert jumps back about a minute - but the words are the same.In the original, Reagan praises the economic benefits of free trade and continues: \"Now, that message of free trade is one I conveyed to Canada's leaders a few weeks ago, and it was warmly received there. Indeed, throughout the world there's a growing realisation that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition.\"He then talks about the \"sound historical reasons\" for this realisation: \"For those of us who lived through the Great Depression, the memory of the suffering it caused is deep and searing.\"He says experts believe high tariff legislation passed at that time \"greatly deepened the depression and prevented economic recovery\".\"America's jobs and growth are at stake.\"This is how Reagan ends his speech both in the address and the advert, in relation to tariffs.The final chunk of his speech is omitted from the ad - in which he says he is determined \"to spare the American people the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity\" and criticises opponents in Congress who \"want to go for the quick political advantage\" and \"forget\" the millions of jobs involved in trade.",

    "body": "We won't accept a stolen vote, Cameroon opposition leader tells BBC31 minutes agoPaul Njie,BBC Africa, Garoua and Wedaeli ChibelushiAFP via Getty Images\"My victory is undeniable,\" said Issa Tchiroma BakaryCameroon's opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who has declared himself the winner of the 12 October elections, has told the BBC that he will not accept a stolen vote, with the results due to be announced on Monday.He says his team has compiled the overall picture based on results from individual polling stations, so there is no doubt.Tchiroma Bakary, 76, is a former government minister who broke ranks with President Paul Biya, 92, who is seeking another term after 43 years in power.The ruling party has dismissed Tchiroma Bakary's victory claims and several officials have described it as illegal because only the Constitutional Council can proclaim official results.Tchiroma Bakary said he had urged his supporters to defend their votes, adding: \"We will never accept their votes being stolen by anyone.\"He said he was not concerned about being arrested or being put in jail, \"but I know that I have already won the presidential election\".\"There is no doubt, no shadow of doubt whatsoever. My victory is undeniable,\" he told the BBC in an interview.Can Biya, the world's oldest president, keep his title?He said the ruling CPDM party had \"their backs against the wall\" and could not accept the reality of the vote, and challenged them to show if what he was saying about the election was wrong.He defended his decision to declare himself himself the winner, insisting that the law \"does not prevent us from so doing\".Tchiroma Bakary has previously said he won the election with about 55% of the vote, based on returns representing 80% of the electorate.Asked whether he would accept defeat if someone else is declared the winner, he said he would agree \"provided the Constitutional Council announces the results that comes from the ballot box, not ballot stuffing\".Tensions over the delayed announcement of the election results have been growing, sparking fears of post-electoral violence in a country already rocked by a separatist conflict in the Anglophone regions and Boko Haram insurgency in the Far North region.The highly respected and influential Catholic Church in Cameroon this week urged calm following fears that violence could erupt once official results are declared.Catholic bishops said they hoped the official result would reflect the will of the electorate, and \"nothing will be changed by any authority involved in this exercise\".AFPIncumbent President Paul Biya only showed up to one rally during the campaign period, accompanied by his wife, ChantalBorn in the northern city of Garoua, Tchiroma trained as an engineer in France before returning to Cameroon to work for the national railway company.In 1984, he was thrown in jail, accused of being involved in an attempt to depose President Biya. Despite denying the allegation and never being convicted, Tchiroma Bakary spent six years in prison. There, he farmed the land with his fellow inmates and taught himself how to speak English.On his release from prison, Tchiroma Bakary began his political career. He became an MP for the opposition UNDP in 1992, but entered an alliance of sorts with Biya and served as his minister of transport for four years.Tchiroma Bakary also served as communications minister from 2009 to 2019.As communications minister and the government's spokesperson, he resolutely defended Biya's government during crises such as the Boko Haram insurgency, when the army was accused of killing civilians.But in June, just four months before the general elections, Tchiroma Bakary changed course dramatically, resigning from the government and announcing he would run against Biya for the presidency.He accused the president of becoming increasingly out of touch, saying \"a country cannot exist in the service of one man\".Despite his recent role as the government's mouthpiece, Tchiroma Bakary drew huge crowds at his rallies, electrifying voters desperate for change.After four decades of Biya's rule, economic development has stagnated and challenges such as inflation, unemployment and insecurity abound.AFP via Getty ImagesTchiroma Bakary's supporters see him as a symbol of changeAdditionally, residents in the English-speaking western region of Cameroon have long complained of marginalisation, and so many there automatically backed Tchiroma Bakary against Biya, seen as representing the French-speaking majority.At one rally in the economic capital of Douala, thousands of supporters waited for hours in the rain to hear Tchiroma Bakary speak. He knows how to command a crowd - a stark contrast to Biya, who spent most of the campaign period in Europe and only showed up for one rally.Some are not so taken with the former spokesperson, however. In his home city of Garoua, a couple of residents told the BBC that Tchiroma Bakary was not their ideal candidate, but at least he offered a change from Biya's lengthy rule.\"We can't continue with the level of underdevelopment that is crippling Cameroon,\" said farmer Benjamin Temunga.Tchiroma Bakary has also sought to distance himself from the government, apologising for his role as its spokesperson.For instance, he defended the military despite knowing they were committing atrocities in amid the Anglophone crisis - a conflict that has seen separatist fighters battling the authorities for more than six years.\"I 100% agree that the military committed atrocities,\" he said. \"But as Minister of Communication, my duty was to defend our armed forces. Today, I speak as a free man.\"Calm and plain-speaking, Tchiroma Bakary is resolute in his stance that the people have put their trust in him. He is the rightful president, he tells the BBC. \"The nation knows it, the world knows it.\"Additional reporting by Basillioh RukangaYou may also be interested in:The African president who keeps defying death rumoursAre Africa's leaders too old to govern the young?Why African leaders maintain secrecy around their healthGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Canada will restart trade talks when 'Americans are ready', says Carney 1 hour agoOsmond Chia,Business reporter, and Maia DaviesCanada's prime minister: American trade policy 'fundamentally changed'Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country is prepared to resume trade talks with the US \"when the Americans are ready.\"His remarks come after US President Donald Trump announced an immediate end to all trade negotiations with Canada over an advert critical of the tariffs he has imposed on the nation. The advert, sponsored by the Canadian province of Ontario, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".Trump wrote on social media that the advert was \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\", adding that trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has imposed a 35% levy on many Canadian imports, as well as individual tariffs targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing. Ontario has been particularly hard-hit by these.Trump has allowed exemptions for goods that fall under a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, negotiated during his first term.But since his election earlier this year, Canada's Carney has attempted to strike a deal that would ease the tariffs. Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, making its economy particularly vulnerable. This effort has been complicated by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is one of the most vocal critics of the taxes levied on US firms buying Canadian products.In the minute-long advert published last week, Reagan's voice can be heard narrating over images that include the New York Stock Exchange and cranes adorned with both US and Canadian flags.The video excerpts from a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focuses on foreign trade.\"When someone says, 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works - but only for a short time,\" Reagan says in the advert.\"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"The Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It said the advert \"misrepresents\" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks.The foundation said it was \"reviewing its legal options\".Trump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to \"interfere with\" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nations' products are legal.  The court's decision represents the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions collected in tariffs.Prime Minister Carney did not address the advertisement in his remarks early on Friday. He said that Canada has made \"a lot of progress\" in trade talks with the US, but is also focused on \"developing new partnerships\" with other countries, including Asia. He spoke as he was departing Canada for the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur. Trump is also expected to attend. Ford, meanwhile, posted the full Reagan speech on X and wrote: \"Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies. President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together.\"While it only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words.The order in which he makes the comments has been changed. The advert's penultimate sentence is taken from near the beginning of his speech, and a phrase that features about halfway through the advert is likewise taken from an earlier point in the address.The original address - titled Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade - is regarding a specific set of tariffs the Reagan administration had at the time imposed on some Japanese goods.Reagan seeks to use the speech to explain why he introduced the tariffs in this \"special case\" despite his belief that \"imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take\".He makes clear that he wants to lift them as soon as possible \"to promote the prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring\" - a position he stresses throughout the speech.Trump later doubled down on his criticism of the advert, writing that \"Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY\".Speaking to White House reporters on Friday morning, US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said that \"frustration has built up over time\" with Canada.\"The Canadians have been very difficult,\" he said.A few minutes earlier, he told Fox Business that \"sometimes when you're frustrated, a time-out is the right call.\"\"It's probably a good time to take a break.\"Getty ImagesDoug Ford, Ontario's premier, has been a vocal critic of Trump's economic policiesThe advert was run as part of a campaign worth $75m Canadian dollars (£40m; $54m) on mainstream TV channels in the US.In a post accompanying the advert last week, Ford wrote that \"we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada\".China's embassy in Washington also used a similar Reagan clip in a post on X to cast doubt on Trump's global tariffs earlier this year.Ontario is Canada's most populous province and its largest regional economy, and has suffered the most as a result of the US tariffs. Ford hit back at Trump's earlier tariff threat against Canada by saying he was willing to cut off power supply to the US.He had also described Washington's trade policies against Canada as having pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\", and called on US lawmakers to put pressure on Trump.Trump's sector-specific levies on Canadian goods include a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.The White House's global tariffs - particularly on steel, aluminium and cars - have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and putting pressure on businesses.It is the second time Trump has said he was ceasing trade talks with Canada, after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms earlier this year.When Canada rescinded the tax, the White House said Carney had \"caved\" to pressure from Trump.",

    "body": "11 hours agoMallory MoenchWatch: FBI director announces alleged schemes involving NBA players and MafiaAn NBA player and coach are among dozens of people arrested as part of a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and allegedly rigged, mafia-linked poker games.Miami Heat player Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were named by federal prosecutors in two separate indictments on Thursday. Both men deny the allegations.Rozier, 31, is among six people arrested over alleged betting irregularities. They include NBA players accused of faking injuries to influence gambling markets. Billups, a Hall of Fame player turned coach, is one of 31 people charged in a separate illegal poker game case involving retired players and the mafia.That case, which prosecutors said involved four of the five major crime families in New York, uncovered an alleged scheme to lure victims into playing rigged poker games alongside high-profile sports stars before stealing millions of dollars. They did so using technology including special contact lenses and glasses that could read pre-marked cards and an X-ray table, according to authorities.The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were being placed on immediate leave as it reviews the federal indictments.\"We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,\" it said.Rozier's lawyer denied the allegations to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, saying: \"Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.\"He appeared in federal court in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday and was released on bail after he put up his Florida home – valued at $6m (£4.5m) – as collateral, according to local media. Billups, who has coached the Portland Trail Blazers since 2021, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, and arraigned in court on Thursday, according to local media. He is expected to prepare a substantial bond for his release, too. His lawyer Chris Heywood also denied the accusations, telling CBS in a statement: \"He will fight these allegations with the same tenacity that marked his 28-year career. We look forward to our day in court.\"Getty ImagesTerry Rozier - better known to some fans as \"Scary Terry\" - is a current NBA player for MiamiFBI Director Kash Patel held a news conference with other prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday where he announced the two indictments. He called the arrests \"extraordinary\" and said there was a \"co-ordinated takedown across 11 states\".\"We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft and robbery across a multi-year investigation,\" he said.US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Joseph Nocella Jr, said all defendants were innocent until proven guilty, but warned: \"Your winning streak has ended. Your luck has run out.\"NBA games under scrutinyProsecutors said the first case involved players and associates who allegedly used  information not available to the public to manipulate bets on major gambling platforms.Nocella called it \"one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes since online sports betting became widely legalised\".What we know about the arrestsSeven NBA games between February 2023 and March 2024 have been identified as part of the case. Rozier is said to have been involved in one between the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans, when he was playing for the Hornets.Rozier is alleged to have told a friend that he would leave the game early due to injury. The friend and his associates then placed bets, or directed others to bet, \"more than $200,000\" that Rozier would underperform expectations in the game, prosecutors said. He left the game after nine minutes, they said, which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in betting profits for those involved.During the game, Rozier scored just five points before going off because of a sore right foot, according to the official NBA match report.Before that game, he averaged 35 minutes of playing time and about 21 points per game.\"As the NBA season tips off, his career is already benched, not for injury but for integrity,\" New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.ReutersPortland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups is accused of involvement in rigged poker gamesRozier's lawyer James Trusty said in a statement that prosecutors \"appear to be taking the word of spectacularly in-credible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case\". Mr Trusty said he had been representing Rozier for more than a year and said prosecutors characterised Rozier as a subject, not a target, until they informed him FBI agents were arresting the player at a hotel on Thursday morning.Former NBA player Damon Jones was also arrested as part of the investigation.Jones is said to have been involved in two of the identified games - when the Los Angeles Lakers met the Milwaukee Bucks in February 2023, and a January 2024 game between the Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder.Sports betting was outlawed in most of the US from 1992 until 2018, when the Supreme Court turned regulation of the practice over to the states. Since the federal ban was struck down, sports betting has exploded with major sports leagues and media companies making deals with gambling firms to get in on the billion-dollar industry.Rigged poker games and the mafiaThe second indictment announced on Thursday involves 31 defendants alleged to have participated in a scheme to rig illegal poker games and steal millions of dollars.The case involved 13 members and associates of the Bonanno, Genovese and Gambino crime families in New York.Nocella said the targeted victims were lured to play games with former professional athletes, including Billups and Jones, in Las Vegas, Miami, Manhattan and the Hamptons.Victims were \"fleeced\" out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game, he said.He said defendants used \"very sophisticated technology\" like altered off-the-shelf shuffling machines that could read the cards. Some of the defendants used special contact lenses and glasses to read marked cards, and an X-ray table that could read cards when they were face-down.\"What [the victims] didn't know is that everybody else at the poker game - from the dealer to the players were in on the scam,\" Nocella said.Tisch said that, when people refused to pay, the organised crime families used threats and intimidation to get them to hand over the money.The charges include robbery, extortion, wire fraud, bank fraud and illegal gambling.The conspiracy cheated victims out of $7m, with one losing $1.8 million, officials said.\"This is only the tip of the iceberg,\" Christopher Raia, the FBI assistant director of the New York field office, said, adding that the FBI was working hard to ensure members of mafia families \"cannot continue to wreak havoc in our communities\".",

    "body": "15 hours agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonGetty ImagesThe managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people and injured another 119 have been placed under criminal investigation, Swiss prosecutors have said. The French couple - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said. Eight Swiss nationals from among those killed were the first to be identified on Saturday. The likely cause of the fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana was sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation found. In a statement, Beatrice Pilloud, the lead prosecutor in the canton of Valais, said investigators were looking into whether the venue's acoustic foam was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16. A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Swiss authorities have not released the names of the eight people whose identification was completed on Saturday - all aged 16-24. Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's Ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

    "body": "The charity Brigitte Bardot established has issued a warning about \"scam\" merchandise purporting to fund its work following the French actress's death.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation said it was aware of \"crude fabrications\" being advertised online alongside claims the proceeds will go to the animal welfare charity.It threatened to take legal action against anyone taking part in \"these alleged illegal fundraising efforts\", stating: \"Everyone is asked to respect the memory of the deceased.\"Bardot died aged 91 last Sunday. After revolutionising 1950s French cinema and becoming a symbol of sexual liberation, she quit acting to devote her life to animals.But the actress-turned-activist courted controversy later in life over a string of remarks about Muslims, gay people and the #MeToo movement. She was fined five times for inciting racial hatred.Her death prompted tributes in France, with President Emmanuel Macron saying the nation was mourning \"a legend of the century\".\"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom,\" he said.But now, online scammers were co-opting her iconic image for \"vulgar and despicable attempts to exploit her legacy\", the Brigitte Bardot Foundation said.It warned of \"the spread on the internet and social networks of offers for sale of photographs, AI-assisted montages, and all kinds of media\" reproducing her image, including \"in fabricated situations\".\"These are crude fabrications, illicit offers and sales, and purported fundraising campaigns that have never received any endorsement from the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which cannot condone these scams,\" it wrote in a statement on Saturday.Bardot starred in nearly 50 films including And God Created Woman and Contempt, setting fashion trends with her tousled blonde hair and bold eyeliner, before becoming the model for Marianne, the personified symbol of France.She retired from acting in 1973, aged 39, declaring: \"I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals.\" Bardot would go on to launch her animal rights foundation 13 years later.Her funeral will take place on Wednesday in Saint-Tropez, southern France, where she lived for decades, in a cemetery overlooking her home and the Mediterranean.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation told French news agency AFP that the private burial  will be \"no frills\" and \"without fuss\", in keeping with her spirit.",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" in reference to demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

    "body": "2 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentThe composer of the musical Wicked has said he will not appear at the Kennedy Center after its board voted to include US President Donald Trump's name in the name of the venue.Stephen Schwartz said in a statement that appearing at the centre \"has now become an ideological statement\", adding: \"As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.\"But Richard Grenell, the center's president, wrote on X that the reports of him pulling out of a gala in May were \"totally bogus\" and that he had never been signed to attend.The Oscar and Grammy-award winning composer is the latest artist to say they will no longer appear at the national cultural institution over the recent changes.Schwartz told the BBC that at the end of 2024 he was asked by the artistic director of the Washington National Opera to participate in the May event with them.He said that he had agreed, but that he had received little communication since last February and assumed it was no longer taking place.The composer explained that, on Thursday, he was contacted by a reporter saying that the gala was announced on the Kennedy Center schedule and asking if he would be participating.He had been listed on the centre's website as appearing in the gala, but this was removed from the website on Friday afternoon, according to CNN.\"The Kennedy Center was founded to be an apolitical home for free artistic expression for artists of all nationalities and ideologies,\" Schwartz, 77, said.\"It is no longer apolitical, and appearing there has now become an ideological statement. As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.\"But Mr Grennell hit back: \"The Stephen Schwartz reports are totally bogus. Shame on the woke high school reporters repeating it.\"He was never signed and I've never had a single conversation on him since arriving.\"He himself said last February he hadn't heard anything on it.\"Two musical acts cancelled their appearances at the centre earlier this week.The Cookers, a veteran jazz band, said they cancelled two New Year's Eve shows. The group did not mention Trump or the Kennedy Center in a statement, but said the decision had \"come together very quickly\".Another group, Doug Varone and Dancers, said they would not perform two shows in April because of the name change, adding: \"We can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution.\"Mr Grenell called the cancellations \"a form of derangement syndrome\".Prior to them, jazz percussionist Chuck Redd called off a Christmas Eve gig he had hosted annually since 2006 at the centre over the name change.Mr Grenell called it a \"political stunt\" and threatened to seek $1m (£740,000) in damages.The Kennedy Center's board, which Trump filled with allies, voted to rename the institution the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in December. New signage appeared on the building's exterior the following day.Some US lawmakers and legal scholars have argued that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, Congress must have a say on any name change.Some members of President John F Kennedy's family have denounced the move. The centre was named in Kennedy's memory shortly after his assassination.Joe Kennedy III, a former US House of Representatives member and grandnephew of the late president, said the venue was \"a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".\"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he added.",

The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish and French nationalities, police said.This brings the number of people who have been identified as killed in the fire to 24.  Among them is 16-year-old Swiss national Arthur Brodard, his mother has said.A criminal investigation into the people who ran Le Constellation bar is under way, while victim's families are enduring an agonising wait for information about loved ones who are still considered missing.Police said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.However, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce that he \"has left to party in paradise\".\"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light,\" she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message.While Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been \"living a nightmare\".Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookArthur Brodard's mother posted a moving tribute to her sonSparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire during New Year's celebrations at the bar, a preliminary investigation has found.

    "body": "Two people including a three-year-old child have been killed and around 28 others injured in a Russian strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A multi-storey residential apartment block was almost completely destroyed in the dual missile attack on Friday afternoon, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called \"heinous\". Russia's Defence Ministry denied reports of an attack, suggesting the blast had been caused by Ukrainian ammunition detonating.The strike comes ahead of crunch talks on a US-brokered peace plan in Kyiv on Saturday.Zelensky says around 15 countries are expected to attend the talks, along with representatives from the EU and Nato, with a US delegation joining the meeting via video link. Leaders of the so-called coalition of the willing are then set to meet in France on 6 January.Officials in Kharkiv said the bodies of a woman and a three-year-old child were found in the rubble, with preliminary information suggesting the pair may have been a mother and son. \"Unfortunately, this is how the Russians treat life and people – they continue killing, despite all efforts by the world, and especially by the United States, in the diplomatic process,\" Zelensky wrote on X.Of the 28 injured, which included a six-month-old baby, 16 have been taken to hospital. A search and rescue operation is ongoing, with more than 80 volunteers working at the scene, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that its armed forces \"neither planned nor launched attacks using missile weapons or aircraft weapons within the city of Kharkiv\".It added that footage from before the attack showed \"heavy smoke of unknown origin\", which it cited as evidence of ammunition detonated by Ukrainian armed forces.The ministry also alleged that the reports were seeking to distract attention from a New Year's Eve strike on a hotel in a Russian-held part of the southern Kherson region of Ukraine.Russia has accused Ukraine of killing at least 27 people and injuring more than 30 others in the drone strike on a New Year's party in the village of Khorly on the Black Sea.The BBC has not been able to independently verify either these claims or the number of casualties.Ukraine told the BBC it would not directly respond to sources of information such as claims from governors of occupied regions.It added that it adhered to the norms of international humanitarian law and conducted strikes exclusively against military targets.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened an investigation into the attack, while the Russian foreign ministry accused Zelensky of \"seeking to intimidate the populations of the reunited Russian regions, who have forever linked their fates with Russia through referendums\".",

    "body": "20 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesNetiv Haasara is a village just on the northern border of Gaza and was hit during the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023The BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family who survived the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks, after a team of journalists entered their badly-damaged home without permission.A BBC News crew, including International Editor Jeremy Bowen, entered the home of an Israeli family on the Gaza border and filmed inside the property in the days after the deadly attacks.They filmed personal photographs of the family's children at a time when many of their friends and relatives still didn't know whether they had survived, the Jewish News reported. A BBC spokesperson said that while they did not generally comment on specific legal issues they were pleased to have reached an agreement in the case.Tzeela Horenstein said gunmen threw a grenade at her husband Simon during Hamas' attack on the village of Netiv HaAsara early in the morning of 7 October. The couple and their two young children only survived because their home's door twisted and jammed when the attackers tried to blow it out with explosives, she told the Jewish News, who first reported the story.She said: \"Not only did terrorists break into our home and try to murder us, but then the BBC crew entered again, this time with a camera as a weapon, without permission or consent.\"It was another intrusion into our lives. We felt that everything that was still under our control had been taken from us.\"The Jewish News reported that the corporation paid a financial settlement of £28,000 to the family. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

He led a long life and no doubt fathered many calves,\" said the Amboseli Trust for Elephants in its farewell message.Famed for his long tusks, Craig the elephant was a major attraction at the park near the Tanzanian border. In 2021, he was named an ambassador for the popular Kenyan lager brand Tusker - a name also used for adult male elephants with tusks.The Kenya Wildlife Service described Craig as an \"icon\" of successful conservation.\"Craig was one of the last remaining super tuskers in Africa - a rare class of bull elephants whose two tusks weigh over 45kg (100lb) each. Fewer than a handful remain today, making him a living monument to Africa's natural heritage.\"The wildlife body also said \"Craig was deeply loved for [his] remarkably calm nature\", often \"pausing patiently as visitors photographed and filmed him\". \"Thanks to his many protectors, he died peacefully of natural causes.\"More than two million tourists visited Kenya last year, many of them seeking out wildlife in the country's world-famous national parks.Kenya's tourism sector accounts for 10% of national GDP, officials say.AFP via Getty ImagesCraig the elephant became a brand ambassador for Tusker five years agoYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

The United Nations says IS still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.In November, Syria - under the leadership of new President Ahmed al-Sharaa - became the 90th country to join a US-led coalition to combat the group.The coalition, officials say, is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.Last month, the US military carried out what it called a \"massive strike\" against IS targets in Syria, following an ambush that killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter in Palmyra.",

    "body": "1 day agoClaire KeenanWatch: Earthquake interrupts Mexico's president during press conferenceAt least two people have died after a powerful earthquake hit southern and central Mexico on Friday.The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the south-western state of Guerrero, which suffered moderate damage.A 50-year-old woman died in Guerrero, the state's governor Evelyn Salgado said, while Clara Brugada, Mexico City's mayor, confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man and said 12 others had been injured in the capital. Mexico is situated in one of the world's most seismically active areas, sitting at the meeting point of four tectonic plates.Late on Friday night, Brugada said power has been restored to \"98% of the failures reported\" in Mexico City.Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, she said, while 34 buildings and five homes were being inspected as a preventative measure.Damage assessments are under way in Mexico City after roads and hospitals were impacted, according to news agency Reuters, while authorities noted various landslides on highways around the Guerrero state. Mexico's seismological service had registered 420 aftershocks by midday local time (18:00 GMT).President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.  In a video capturing the moment, Sheinbaum can be heard saying \"it's shaking\" as an earthquake alert system rings in the background. She then tells the media to \"all get out calmly\".

    "body": "'A long road ahead': Venezuelans react to Maduro's arrest with hope and worry9 hours agoGrace Eliza Goodwin,Cristobal VasquezandTom Bateman,US State Department correspondentReutersAs the dust settles in Caracas, Venezuelans are reacting to the news of President Nicolás Maduro's capture by the US with hope, fear, and uncertainty. People began to emerge in the streets Saturday after a night rocked by explosions in the Caracas Valley, with moods that ranged from celebration to condemnation.  Dina, a local resident, told the BBC that for now, she was grateful to the US for \"taking Maduro out of here\" because she \"at least can see some light at the end of the tunnel again\". But the political climate remains tense, part of why she did not give the BBC her real name. Jorge, another Venezuelan who lives near Caracas, told the BBC that while he's grateful to be \"well-supported by Trump and the entire United States\", he fears the coming days will not be easy. \"Now that they are taking this man away, what's going to happen?\" he said. \"It doesn't guarantee us anything. So there is a bit of uncertainty. We don't know what the coming days will bring.\"Supporters of Maduro's government have also been rallying in the streets of Caracas, demanding the US release their leader. Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, joined in the rally to protest against what she called Maduro's \"kidnapping\". Early on Saturday, US forces under President Donald Trump carried out a series of targeted attacks in Venezuela's capital, ultimately taking the country's leader into US custody. The US accuses Maduro of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime, a claim he denies. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Maduro - who leads the United Socialist Party and has been in power since 2013 - has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence.As Maduro and his wife are extradited to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, the future of Venezuela remains unclear. Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established. Maduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking.But even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there's still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC.Dina isn't putting much faith in Trump. \"He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,\" Dina said. \"I mean, I'm not used to taking his words seriously.\"The \"only thing that was good\" about what Trump has said since Maduro's capture, Dina said, was that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to \"a better economic situation\" for the struggling country. Venezuela VP: Maduro is 'the only president'The danger of speaking out against Maduro is still very real within Venezuela, as the National Assembly - which is dominated by Maduro loyalists - passed a law a few weeks ago declaring anyone who expresses support for US naval blockades a \"traitor\".Jorge said he saw motorcyclists from colectivos - pro-government paramilitary groups in Venezuela - roaming the streets with weapons on Friday. \"It makes you a bit afraid to even go out to buy bread right now,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait for the best and have patience.\"Jorge added that he was worried about the influence of Maduro's ally, Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela's Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace.\"He is a very bad person, very spiteful,\" Jorge said. \"I don't know how many people he has on his side. Hopefully, the army stands with the people and he loses some control.\"Sandra echoed Jorge and Dina's relief at Maduro's ousting. But, she too is sceptical about the future and what it means for Venezuelans in exile. Close to eight million Venezuelans have left Venezuela since Maduro came to power - and many of them have been openly celebrating Maduro's capture in the streets of the cities where they have settled.In addition to the millions in exile, others are \"missing, imprisoned, dead, or merely surviving\" - which is \"a true tragedy that had not been addressed by any country\", Sandra said. \"This is only the beginning. We know there is still a long road ahead,\" Sandra added. \"No country had previously heard the cry of Venezuelans in the face of this tragedy\". Additional reporting by Kristina Volk",

    "body": "'Deeply shocked': World leaders react to US attack on Venezuela 6 hours agoClaire KeenanTrump on Venezuela: \"We are going to run the country\"Leaders around the world have responded with a mix of condemnation and support to the US capture of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro. Following a large-scale strike on Venezuela on Saturday, Maduro and his wife were captured by US forces and removed from the country. The pair have been indicted on drug charges in New York. In an initial response, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would \"shed no tears\" for the end of Maduro's regime.Neighbouring Latin American countries condemned the actions, as did Venezuela's long-term allies, Russia and China. China said it was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemns\" the use of force against a sovereign country and its president. Russia accused the US of committing \"an act of armed aggression\".Iran, which is locked in its own dispute with Trump over his promise of intervention in its country, called the strikes a \"flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty\".Trump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela \"until we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\". Many Latin American leaders condemned the US actions. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva wrote on X that the actions \"cross an unacceptable line\", adding that \"attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability\". Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the strikes an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, while Chile's President Gabriel Boric expressed \"concern and condemnation\" and called for \"a peaceful solution to the serious crisis affecting the country\".Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Cane accused the US of a \"criminal attack\", while Uruguay said in an official statement that it was monitoring developments \"with attention and serious concern\" and \"rejects, as it always has, military intervention\".Trump has indicated that Cuba could become part of a broader US policy in the region, calling it a failing nation. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Cuba was a disaster run by incompetent leaders who supported Maduro's administration and that the government in Havana should be concerned.The Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello urged citizens to remain calm and to trust the country's leadership and military, saying \"the world needs to speak out about this attack\" according to news agency Reuters.

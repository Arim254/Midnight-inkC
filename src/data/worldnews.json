Paramount declined to comment on reports that the firm had paid $150m in stock and cash. </p><p>Mr Ellison, the founder and CEO of Skydance Media, made his name as a Hollywood film producer of blockbusters such as Top Gun Maverick, True Grit and World War Z. </p><p>He has said his aim was to produce coverage that was less politically skewed, and therefore had the ability to reach all audiences. </p><p>His takeover of Paramount was approved by the Trump administration this summer, after the company agreed to pay $16m to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with his 2024 presidential rival Kamala Harris he said was deceptively edited to benefit Democrats. </p><p>To win approval of the deal, Mr Ellison agreed to install an independent ombudsman at CBS to review complaints of bias and committed to regulators that programming would reflect a diversity of view points. </p><p>He also said CBS's long-running political show \"Face the Nation\" would no longer air edited interviews. </p></div><div><p>CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.</p><p>In a note announcing the deal, Ms Weiss said she believed in the Paramount boss and his leadership team.</p><p>\"They are doubling down because they believe in news. Because they have courage. Because they love this country. And because they understand, as we do, that America cannot thrive without common facts, common truths, and a common reality,\" she wrote. </p></div></article>",

Trump said on social media they had a \"very good telephone call\".</p><p>It is the first time the two have spoken formally since they had a brief encounter at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month.</p><p>Relations had been icy since Trump raised tariffs this summer to 50% on some Brazilian goods in response to the trial of Lula's predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c147n38k800o\">who was found guilty</a> of plotting a military coup.</p></div><div><p>Lula had accused Trump of foreign interference and behaving like an \"emperor\".</p><p>But on Monday, the Brazilian government said the two leaders spoke in a \"friendly tone\" for half an hour and \"reminisced about the good chemistry\" they had in New York.</p><p>Lula described the meeting as an opportunity to \"restore\" friendly relations between \"the two largest Western democracies\" and reiterated that the US had a trade surplus with Brazil. </p><p>He requested that tariffs be reduced to their original 10% and for sanctions on some Brazilian officials be removed.</p><p>The two exchanged phone numbers to keep in touch directly.</p><p>Trump said on his Truth Social platform: \"It [the call] was mostly focused on the economy, and trade, between our two countries. </p><p>\"We will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future, both in Brazil and the United States.\"</p><p>Brazilian Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin described the call as \"better than expected\", and said he was optimistic about talks between the two countries.</p><p>Lula invited Trump to next month's UN climate summit in Belém, Brazil, suggested meeting during the Asean summit in Malaysia, and offered to travel to the US.</p><p>Trump has appointed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to continue negotiations with Brazil's vice-president, foreign minister and finance minister. </p><p>A source within the Brazilian government close to Lula told the BBC that the appointment of Rubio as lead negotiator on the tariff issue was still being reviewed by the team led by Vice-President Alckmin.</p><p>The source noted that the Brazilian government was not ignoring the fact that Rubio was considered part of the so-called \"ideological wing\" of the Trump administration. </p><p>On the other hand, the source added that, for the government, it was preferable to have a negotiator who was directly connected to the president and had his endorsement, rather than someone without direct communication with Trump.</p><p>Another source, also involved in the negotiations and speaking to BBC Brasil on condition of anonymity, was more direct: they said that Lula's government would have preferred a different interlocutor to Rubio.</p></div>",

It warned that there may still be delays on Monday.</p><p>The \"airspace violations\" come at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c708dzqvz1vo\">a time of heightened tension in Europe</a> after a number of drone incursions, suspected of being linked to Russia, caused air traffic disruption.</p></div><div><p>Moscow has denied any involvement in the recent incidents.</p><p>Up to 14 of the weather balloons launched over the weekend floated over the Vilnius area, home to Lithuania's capital and close to the border with Belarus, Lithuanian officials said.</p><p>At least 11 balloons carrying 18,000 packs of black-market cigarettes have since been recovered, though this number could rise, Lithuania's State Border Guard Service said.</p><p>Despite the disruption they caused, a NCMC spokesman said: \"Balloons with contraband cargo - cigarettes from Belarus - are nothing new in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland.\"</p><p>So far this year, 544 balloons have been recorded entering Lithuania from Belarus, he said, while 966 were last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the north-eastern Podlaskie region of Poland, which also borders Belarus, has recorded more than 100 cases in which contraband was flown in from its neighbour using the balloons, which are typically used to carry weather instruments to high altitudes.</p><p>In one instance last month, Polish police detained a Belarusian citizen whose car had been circling cigarettes smuggled in using a balloon. A geolocation tag was reportedly found on his phone linked to the illicit goods.  </p><p>Asked why criminals use a method that is highly susceptible to the weather, rather than much more controllable drones, the NCMC spokesman said: \"Meteorological balloons are a rudimentary tool used by smugglers - they are cheaper than drones for transporting cigarettes from Belarus.\"</p><p>He added: \"Our services' aim is to seize the largest possible quantities of contraband and to detain organisers and perpetrators so that this activity is unprofitable and does not pose a risk to civil aviation.\"</p><p>Drones of unclear origin caused the closure of Danish airports and airspace in September. Drones were also seen over neighbouring Norway and Germany, prompting European leaders to accelerate discussions about strengthening air defences.</p><p>Denmark said at the time there was no evidence to suggest Russian involvement, despite Moscow being blamed for earlier airspace incursions into Poland, Estonia and Romania. </p><p>Russia either denied these earlier incursions or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7401vk4lgzo\">said they were accidental</a> as its full-scale invasion of nearby Ukraine continues.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>Israel has deported Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and 170 other pro-Palestinian activists who were detained when Israeli forces intercepted a flotilla trying to breach its naval blockade of Gaza to deliver aid last week.</p><p>Thunberg raised her fist as she was presented with flowers and cheered by dozens of supporters who had gathered at Athens airport.</p><p>The Israeli foreign minister said the activists had been flown to Greece and Slovakia, and that Greek, Slovakian, French, Italian, British and US citizens were among them.</p><p>It also once again rejected as \"fake news\" accusations that the activists were mistreated and denied basic rights while in detention.</p></div><div><p>So far, the ministry has announced the deportations of 341 of the 479 people who were on board the 42 boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF).</p><p>The 138 other activists remain in detention in Israel. More than 40 were confirmed to be on hunger strike on Sunday, according to the GSF.</p><p>It said the goal of the flotilla was to \"break the illegal siege on Gaza by sea, open a humanitarian corridor, and end the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people\".</p><p>It also said the interceptions violated international maritime and humanitarian law.</p><p>Israeli authorities said they enforced a legal blockade and called the flotilla a \"publicity stunt\" because it was transporting only two tons of aid in total.</p></div><div><p>Greece's foreign ministry said Thunberg was among 161 citizens of 16 European countries who were flown to Athens on Monday after being deported by Israel. Slovakia said it had received 10 other people on a separate flight.</p><p>On arrival in Athens, the Swedish activist told reporters that the GSF had been \"the biggest ever attempt to break Israel's illegal and inhumane siege by sea\".</p><p>\"It was a story of global, international solidarity, of people stepping up when our governments failed to do so, of people saying that: 'My so-called leaders - who were supposed to represent me, who continue to fuel a genocide, death and destruction - they do not represent me. This is a last resort. That this mission has to exist is a shame.\"</p><p>\"I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me, but that is not the story,\" she added.</p><p>On Sunday night, lawyer Rafael Borrego was among a group of deported Spanish activists who told reporters at Madrid airport that they had suffered \"repeated physical and mental abuse\".</p><p>\"They beat us, dragged us along the ground, blindfolded us, tied our hands and feet, put us in cages and insulted us,\" he alleged.</p><p>Nine Swiss nationals who returned to Geneva on Sunday also complained about what they called the \"inhumane detention conditions and the humiliating and degrading treatment\", Reuters news agency cited a statement as saying.</p><p>The Israeli foreign ministry's statement on Monday insisted that the flotilla activists' legal rights \"were and will continue to be fully upheld\".</p><p>\"The lies they are spreading are part of their pre-planned fake news campaign,\" it said.</p><p>The ministry said the only violent incident happened when a Spanish citizen bit a female medical worker at Ketziot prison following a routine medical examination ahead of her deportation on Monday. The medic sustained minor injuries, it added.</p><p>The GSF's boats set sail from Barcelona at the end of last month after experts from the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed there was a famine in Gaza City, and warned that it could spread to central and southern Gaza within weeks.</p><p>Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 460 Palestinians have died from the effects of malnutrition since the start of the war, including 182 since the famine declaration.</p><p>The UN has called on Israel to urgently lift the blockade on Gaza and allow the entry of life-saving material through all means possible.</p><p>It has said that as the occupying power, Israel is obliged under international law to ensure sufficient food and medical supplies reach Gaza's population.</p><p>Israel has insisted it acts in accordance with international law and facilitates the entry of aid.</p><p>It has also disputed the IPC's findings and the health ministry's figures, and strongly denied the allegation - most recently made by a UN commission of inquiry - that its forces have committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 67,160 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.</p></div>",

It was one of nine ships in the country's small naval fleet, and had been surveying an area of sea floor that had not been mapped in decades when it ran aground.</p></div><div><p>All 75 people aboard were successfully rescued from the vessel as it began listing off the coast of the Samoan island Upolu exactly a year ago.</p><p>Despite being seen billowing smoke as it went down, Samoan officials later said that not all its fuel had burnt off and the ship had leaked oil from various locations - sparking concerns about local marine wildlife. </p><p>Since the ship's grounding, HMNZS Manawanui has remained on the reef but diesel fuel, oil and other pollutants have been removed from the ship while a New Zealand naval team was tasked with removing debris.</p><p>Peters said in a statement that the New Zealand government was continuing to work with Samoa's on decisions relating to the ship and its future.</p><p>\"We recognise the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused,\" he said.</p><p>He added that \"minimising any possible environmental impacts and supporting the response\" were \"our absolute priorities\".</p><p>Any disciplinary proceedings were yet to be determined but the New Zealand Defence Force was reaching the end of its investigation, he said.</p><p>An<b> </b>inquiry into the incident found a series of human errors, including a failure to disengage the ship's autopilot, was the root cause of the crash.</p><p>In the days after the crash, social media users started trolling the ship's female captain, claiming her gender was to blame.</p><p>These commenters were denounced at the time by New Zealand's defence minister as \"armchair admirals\".</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>11 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Anthony Zurcher</span><span>North America correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The US Supreme Court begins its new term on Monday with a docket already full of potentially significant cases that could define the scope of Donald Trump's presidential authority - and the prospect of more to come.</p><p>In the eight months that Trump has been back in the White House, he has tested the limits of executive power, unilaterally implementing new policies, slashing federal budgets and workforce, and attempting to bring previously independent agencies and institutions more directly under his control.</p><p>The latest brewing legal battle comes from the president's attempts to take control of state National Guard units and deploy them in cities where he claims there is public unrest and rampant crime - over the objection of local and state officials.</p><p>In Oregon, a federal judge has issued orders blocking Trump's deployment of troops to Portland. An appeals court is set to review the move in the coming days.</p><p>\"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" Judge Karin Immergut, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, wrote in her Saturday opinion. </p><p>\"Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power - to the detriment of this nation.\"</p></div><div><p>Once the appellate court has its say, the Supreme Court could step in via its so-called \"shadow docket\", issuing a ruling that could curtail Trump's ability to use the military on US soil - or give him a free hand, at least temporarily.</p><p>Such reviews have become a more routine occurrence recently, as a majority of the Supreme Court justices, in response to emergency petitions from the Trump administration, has largely allowed the president's actions to move forward while legal challenges play out.</p><p>\"A tug of war between the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts is going to be a driving force in the coming term,\" Samuel Bray, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said at a briefing last month.</p><p>The court's reliance on this shadow docket has been criticised by left-leaning legal scholars and politicians as an improper use of the court's authority. Its orders have typically been short, offering limited legal reasoning and leaving lower-level judges with minimal guidance.</p><p>\"All Americans should be alarmed by the Supreme Court's growing reliance on its shadow docket to resolve controversial and high-profile cases without any transparency - no substantive explanations, oral arguments, or reasoning,\" Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said earlier this year.</p><p>\"This further pushes the Court's deliberations and decisions out of view of public scrutiny and shields it from accountability.\"</p><p>In the coming months, however, the court is set tackle questions of presidential power – and other high-profile controversies - head on, hearing oral arguments and issuing full decisions on their merits.</p><p>\"It's not going to be able to get away with one-page orders that don't explain the reasoning,\" said Maya Sen, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School who specialises in the Supreme Court and US politics. \"If they're going to grant more power to the executive its going to have to explain why.\"</p><p>The court is already scheduled to consider whether federal laws prohibit the president from removing members of agencies designed by Congress to be independent from presidential influence infringe on executive authority.</p><p>The justices will also hear arguments in an expedited review of Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from her position as a governor on the influential Federal Reserve Board – a case that could dramatically increase the president's power over American economic policy.</p><p>The US – and global economy – is also front and centre as Supreme Court justices will have a chance to decide whether many of Trump's unilaterally imposed tariffs on foreign imports have adequate legal authority or should be voided.</p><p>The justices may also review Trump's attempts to unilaterally cut federal spending and fire lower-level government employees, as well as his aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p><p>While the court has not yet agreed to consider Trump's attempt to terminate automatic citizenship for those born on US soil, it could do so in the coming months.</p><p>\"The scope of executive power will be front and centre this term,\" said Professor Jennifer Nou of the University of Chicago Law School, in an email to the BBC.</p><p>\"The cases coming before the court will test the Trump administration's highest political and economic priorities, whether tariffs or birthright citizenship.</p><p>\"One question will be whether the justices will apply principles (eg the major questions doctrine) that it used to strike down signature Biden initiatives in a politically even-handed way.\"</p><p>The court used its newly fashioned \"major questions doctrine\" to stymie Biden's efforts at student loan forgiveness and environmental regulations, holding that Congress did not give him explicit authorisation to do so.</p><p>Presidential power is the central focus of this year's Supreme Court term but cases involving several hot-button political and cultural controversies are also scheduled in the coming months.</p><p>The court will review whether a Colorado ban on conversion therapy – a controversial practice that attempts to use counselling to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity – violates constitutional free speech protections.</p><p>Also on the docket are two cases involving state bans on transgender athletes in interscholastic sport competition.</p><p>A Republican congressman in Illinois is challenging a state law that allows mailed ballots to be counted up to two weeks after election day.</p><p>A group of Louisiana conservatives have asked the court to strike down a provision of a voting rights law that requires states to draw congressional districts that guarantee Black voter representation equal to their population level.</p><p>And the Republican Party is targeting a decades-old law that prevents political candidates and parties from coordinating their campaign spending.</p><p>Over the past few years, this conservative-dominated Supreme Court has demonstrated a willingness to issue landmark new rulings that have dramatically shifted America's legal landscape.</p><p>On topics like abortion rights, federal regulatory authority and the consideration of race in college admissions, the court has reversed decades of existing precedent.</p><p>Those decisions have contributed to a public view of the Supreme Court that has become increasingly polarised along partisan lines.</p><p>In a recent Pew Foundation poll, opinions of the nation's highest legal body were split nearly evenly, with Republicans supportive and Democrats highly critical.</p><p>By the time the court issues its final decisions in this term, expected by the end of June next year, the 6-3 conservative majority on the court may have broken new ground, and once again fundamentally reshaped American law.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Kayla Epstein</i></p></div>",

This enabled the growth in renewable generation in China to outpace rising electricity demand and helped reduce its fossil fuel generation by 2%.</p><p>India experienced slower electricity demand growth and also added significant new solar and wind capacity, meaning it too cut back on coal and gas.</p><p>In contrast, developed nations like the US, and also the EU, saw the opposite trend.</p><p>In the US, electricity demand grew faster than clean energy output, increasing reliance on fossil fuels, while in the EU, months of weak wind and hydropower performance led to a rise in coal and gas generation.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Under a dramatic sky rows of blue solar photovoltaic panels neatly arranged at the leading Photovoltaic Technology base in Yuncheng City, Shanxi Province, China. \n\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><p></p><h2>'Crucial' turning point</h2><p></p><div><p>Despite these regional differences, Ember calls this moment a \"crucial turning point\".</p><p>Ember senior analyst Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka said it \"marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth\".</p><p>Solar power delivered the lion's share of growth, meeting 83% of the increase in electricity demand. It has now been the largest source of new electricity globally for three years in a row.</p><p>Most solar generation (58%) is now in lower-income countries, many of which have seen explosive growth in recent years.</p></div><div><p>That's thanks to spectacular reductions in cost. Solar has seen prices fall a staggering 99.9% since 1975 and is now so cheap that large markets for solar can emerge in a country in the space of a single year, especially where grid electricity is expensive and unreliable, says Ember.</p><p>Pakistan, for example, imported solar panels capable of generating 17 gigawatts (GW) of solar power in 2024, double the previous year and the equivalent of roughly a third of the country's current electricity generation capacity.</p><p>Africa is also experiencing a solar boom with panel imports up 60% year on year, in the year to June. Coal-heavy South Africa led the way, while Nigeria overtook Egypt into second place with 1.7GW of solar generating capacity - that's enough to meet the electricity demand of roughly 1.8m homes in Europe.</p><p>Some smaller African nations have seen even more rapid growth with Algeria increasing imports 33-fold, Zambia eightfold and Botswana sevenfold.</p><p>In some countries the growth of solar has been so rapid it is creating unexpected challenges.</p><p>In Afghanistan, widespread use of solar-powered water pumps is lowering the water table, threatening long-term access to groundwater. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.xcept-research.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-05-21_XCEPT-Public_-Report_Digging-an-ever-deeper-hole.pdf\">A study by Dr David Mansfield and satellite data firm Alcis</a> warns that some regions could run dry within five to ten years, endangering millions of livelihoods.</p></div><div><p>Adair Turner, chair of the UK's Energy Transitions Commission, says countries in the global \"sun belt\" and \"wind belt\" face very different energy challenges.</p><p>Sun belt nations - including much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America - need large amounts of electricity for daytime air conditioning. These countries can significantly reduce energy costs almost immediately by adopting solar-based systems, supported by increasingly affordable batteries that store energy from day to night.</p><p>Wind belt countries like the UK face tougher obstacles, however. Wind turbine costs have not come down by anything like as much as solar panels - down just a third or so in the last decade. Higher interest rates have also added to borrowing costs and raised the overall price of installing wind farms significantly in the last few years.</p><p>Balancing supply is harder too: winter wind lulls can last for weeks, requiring backup power sources that batteries alone can't provide - making the system more expensive to build and run.</p><p>But wherever you are in the world, China's overwhelming dominance in clean tech industries remains unchallenged, other new data from Ember shows.</p><p>In August 2025, its clean tech exports hit a record $20bn, driven by surging sales of electric vehicles (up 26%) and batteries (up 23%). Together, China's electric vehicles and batteries are now worth more than twice the value of its solar panel exports.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, green banner promoting the Future Earth newsletter with text saying, “Get the latest climate news from the UK and around the world every week, straight to your inbox”.

It is thought 48 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.</p><p>Trump said over the weekend the hostages could be released \"very soon\", while Netanyahu said they could be freed before the end of the Jewish holiday Sukkot - or October 13th.</p><p>Hamas has agreed to the hostage \"exchange formula\" detailed in Trump's plan, providing certain \"field conditions\" are met.</p><p>But the hostages are the group's only bargaining chip - and it's unclear whether it would be willing to release them before other elements of the deal are finalised.</p><p>Trust between the two sides is virtually non-existent. Only last month, Israel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zepgp5neo\">attempted to assassinate Hamas's negotiating team</a> with an air strike on Doha - angering not only Hamas but also Trump and Qatar, a key mediator.</p><p>Members of that same negotiating team - headed by Khalil al-Hayya, whose son was killed in the strike - will now be meeting just a stone's throw from Israel's delegation in Egypt.</p></div><p></p><h2>Hamas disarmament</h2><p></p><div><p>Israel's stated goal throughout the war has been the destruction of Hamas. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated he will not stop until the group is finished. </p><p>A key point in Trump's plan requires the group to disarm. But Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established.</p><p>In its response, Hamas made no mention of disarmament - fuelling speculation that it has not changed its position.</p><p>Over the weekend, Netanyahu vowed: \"Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised – either the easy way or the hard way\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Future governance of Gaza</h2><p></p><div><p>The plan states that Hamas will have no future role in Gaza, which will be governed by a temporary transitional body of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a \"Board of Peace\" headed and chaired by Donald Trump and involving former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p>Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>Though Netanyahu agreed to all of Trump's 20-point plan, he appeared to push back on involvement of the PA even as he stood on the podium next to the president last week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jq63edv21o\">insisting it would play no role</a> in governing the territory.</p><p>This is one of many points in the plan that will be objectionable to ultranationalist hardliners within Netanyahu's governing coalition - many of whom want to retain control of Gaza and reconstruct Jewish settlements there.</p><p>In Hamas's response, it indicated that it expects to have some future role in Gaza as part of \"a unified Palestinian movement\". Though the wording is vague, this will likely be unacceptable to both Trump and the Israelis.</p></div><p></p><h2>Israeli withdrawal</h2><p></p><div><p>The extent of Israel's military withdrawal is a fourth point of contention.</p><p>The plan states that Israel's military will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes\" that must be agreed by all parties.</p><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c5ykwny8dp9o\">map distributed by the White House</a> showed three proposed stages of Israeli troop withdrawal. The first stage leaves about 55% of Gaza under Israeli control, the second 40%, and the final 15%.</p><p>That final stage would be a \"security perimeter\" that would \"remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat\".</p><p>The wording here is vague and gives no clear timeline for full Israeli withdrawal - something Hamas are likely to want clarity on.</p><p>Additionally, the map shared by the White House doesn't match up with the Israeli military's own maps showing militarised areas, and Gaza's borders are incorrectly drawn in places.</p></div><p></p><h2>Netanyahu's future</h2><p></p><div><p>For more than a year, the Israeli Prime Minister has faced accusations he is only continuing the war in Gaza to remain in power. </p><p>Far-right members of his cabinet have threatened to end his coalition government if the war ends before Hamas is destroyed. </p><p>Earlier this year, Netanyahu and Trump were advocating redeveloping Gaza into a \"riviera\", which would have involved the forced displacement of Palestinians from the Strip. </p><p>This latest plan is a significantly different - and may be a tough pill for hardliners who had given the \"riviera\" idea their full backing to swallow.</p><p>Netanyahu also faces a major corruption trial, which would resume in full should the war end. Some fear a collapse of talks could personally benefit him.</p><p>But there would also be a political benefit in ending the war - even if the terms aren't what he might have hoped for. Polls now consistently show that around 70% of Israelis want the war to end in exchange for the release of the hostages.</p><p>Regardless, Netanyahu will have to face elections in 2026. </p></div><div><p><span> More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

He can once again dissolve the National Assembly. Or he can resign himself.</p><p>The last is the least likely, while the first would be his natural choice.</p><p>However, who now could he name to form a government? Lecornu – the ultimate Macron loyalist – was seen as his last resort, but now he too has failed.</p><p>He could appoint a Socialist, on the basis that the left deserves a go at government - but a Socialist administration would itself not take long to fall.</p><p>So the logic must surely be for option two: for new legislative elections.</p><p>The result would probably be a rout for the pro-Macron centre, and a big victory for the hard-right of Marine Le Pen. But when every other recourse fails, few avenues remain.</p><p>Lecornu, a former armed forces minister, was France's fifth prime minister in under two years. </p><p>In his brief speech outside the Hôtel de Matignon on Monday morning, the prime minister's residence which he only occupied for less than a month, Lecornu sharply criticised the \"partisan appetites\" of political factions, who he said \"are all behaving as if they had an absolute majority\". </p><p>\"I was ready for compromise but all parties wanted the other party to adopt their programmes in their entirety,\" he said. </p><p>\"It wouldn't need much for this to work,\" he added, saying, however, that parties needed to be more humble and \"to cast some egos aside\".</p><p>The entrenched divisions in French politics have made it difficult for any prime minister to garner the necessary support to pass any bills.</p><p>Michel Barnier was appointed prime minister last September but was toppled within three months in a vote of no confidence.</p><p>The government of his successor François Bayrou's too was voted down after nine months after parliament refused to back his austerity budget, which aimed to slash government spending by €44bn ($51bn; £38bn). </p><p>France's deficit reached 5.8% of its GDP in 2024 and its national debt is 114% of its GDP. That is the third highest public debt in the eurozone after Greece and Italy, and equivalent to almost €50,000 per French citizen.</p></div>",

For a youth-led party, losing on their home turf has raised questions about their prospects in the national election.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7ea6/live/5d4af760-a2c0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7ea6/live/5d4af760-a2c0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ea6/live/5d4af760-a2c0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7ea6/live/5d4af760-a2c0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7ea6/live/5d4af760-a2c0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7ea6/live/5d4af760-a2c0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7ea6/live/5d4af760-a2c0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ea6/live/5d4af760-a2c0-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia waves to activists as she arrives for a rally in Dhaka in this file picture taken January 20, 2014.

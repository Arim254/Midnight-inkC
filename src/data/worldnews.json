    "body": "14 hours agoDoug FaulknerReutersHannibal Gaddafi, now 49, pictured in 2010Hannibal Gaddafi, the youngest son of the deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, has been released by Lebanon after nearly 10 years in detention without trial.The Lebanese authorities seized Mr Gaddafi, now 49, in 2015, accusing him of concealing information about the fate of a Lebanese Shia cleric who disappeared in Libya in 1978, when he was just two. Human rights groups had denounced the accusations.His lawyer told the AFP news agency his $900,000 (£682,938) bail had been paid.Laurent Bayon said: \"It's the end of a nightmare for him that lasted 10 years.\"In October, a judge set a $11m bail against Gaddafi's release but this was reduced last week after an appeal by his defence team, according to AFP.Mr Bayon said his client would leave Lebanon for a \"confidential\" destination.\"If Gaddafi was able to be arbitrarily detained in Lebanon for 10 years, it's because the justice system was not independent,\" Bayon said, according to AFP.In 2015, Mr Gaddafi was briefly abducted by an armed group in Lebanon before being freed. He was later detained by Lebanese authorities.After his father was overthrown by rebels and killed in 2011, he fled to Syria and then had lived under house arrest in Oman with his wife Aline Skaf.Before the fall of his father's regime Mr Gaddafi was known for his lavish lifestyle. The disappearance of Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr in Libya in 1978 has been a source of tension between Libya and Lebanon for decades.Hannibal Gaddafi was only two at the time and held no senior position in Libya as an adult.",

    "body": "Australian scientists have discovered a new native bee species with tiny horns - and given it a suitably devilish name. Researchers found the Megachile Lucifer while observing a rare wildflower that only grows in the Bremer Ranges in Western Australia's Goldfields region, 470km (292 miles) east of Perth.The \"highly distinctive, prominent horns\" are only on the female bee and may be used as a defence mechanism, to gather pollen or nectar, or to collect materials such as resin for nests.The study's lead scientist said she was inspired to use the name Lucifer as she was watching the Netflix show of the same name at the time. She adds it is the first new member of this bee group in 20 years. \"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" said Dr Kit Prendergast from Curtin University .\"When writing up the new species description I was watching the Netflix show Lucifer at the time, and the name just fit perfectly. I am also a huge fan of the Netflix character Lucifer so it was a no-brainer.\"Lucifer - which means \"light bringer\" in Latin - is also a reference to shining light on the need for better conservation of native bee species and greater understanding of how endangered plants are pollinated, she said. The report, which was published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, also called for the area in and around where the new bee species and rare wildflowers were found to be \"formally protected and gazetted as conservation land that cannot be cleared\".\"Because the new species was found in the same small area as the endangered wildflower, both could be at risk from habitat disturbance and other threatening processes like climate change,\" she said, adding that many mining companies do not include native bees when assessing the environmental impact of their operations.\"So we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems.\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realise they're there.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentGettyDrug tests on rabbits could end by the end of the yearThe government has detailed for the first time how it aims to fulfil its manifesto pledge to work toward phasing out animal testing.The new plans include replacing animal testing for some major safety tests by the end of this year and cutting the use of dogs and non-human primates in tests for human medicines by at least 35% by 2030. The Labour Party said in its manifesto that it would \"partner with scientists, industry, and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing\".Science Minister Lord Vallance told BBC News that he could imagine a day where the use of animals in science was almost completely phased out but acknowledged that it would take time.Animal experiments in the UK peaked at 4.14 million in 2015 driven mainly by a big increase then in genetic modification experiments – mostly on mice and fishBy 2020, the number had fallen sharply to 2.88 million as alternative methods were developed. But since then that decline has plateaued. Lord Vallance told BBC News that he wants to re-ignite the fast downward trend by replacing animal testing with experiments on animal tissues grown from stem cells, AI, and computer simulations.Asked by BBC News if he could envisage a world where animal tests were \"near zero\", he said: \"I think that is possible, it's not possible anytime soon, the idea that we can eliminate animal use in the foreseeable future, I don't think is there.\"Can we get very close to it? I think we can. Can we push faster than we have been? I think we can. Should we? We absolutely should.\"\"This is a moment to really grasp that and drive these alternative approaches,\" he said.According to the government's newly detailed plans, by the end of 2025, scientists will stop using animals for some major safety tests and switch to newer lab methods that use human cells instead.As a former government chief scientific advisor and former head of research for a major pharmaceutical company, he will know that many scientists believe reaching \"near zero\" tests on animals will be extremely difficult, even in the longer term. That includes those who are the greatest advocates of non-animal methods.\"I very strongly believe that that is not possible for reasons of safety,\" said Prof Frances Balkwill, of Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London.Prof Balkwill is working on finding ways stop ovarian cancer recurring, using mice as well as non-animal approaches, of which she is a huge fan.\"These non-animal methods will never replace the complexity that we can see when we have a tumour growing in a whole organism, such as a mouse,\" she said.Kevin Church/BBC NewsThis organ on a chip can hold small amounts of human cells from different organs and be used in place of animals for some types of experimentsOne of the world's leading centres for developing alternatives to animal testing is the Centre for Predictive in vitro Models (CPM) at Queen Mary University of London.Researchers here are developing the extraordinarily sounding \"organ-on-a-chip\" technology, conjuring up alarming images of throbbing brains and beating hearts sitting on top of electronic circuits.The reality, though, is far less sci-fi.Some small pieces of glassware containing tiny samples of human cells from different organs from the body, such as the liver or brain, are connected to electrodes which send information to a computer. What is amazing, said the CPM's co-director, Prof Hazel Screen, is that cells from various parts of the body can be connected together to mimic how different organs work together.\"In theory, you can build any organ on a chip. Then I can use it to test a new drug,\" she said.\"And because we're taking human cells, we should be able to do better quality science.\"The safety tests that the government says will no longer use animals by the end of this year include the practice of giving rabbits a small dose of a new drug – called the pyrogen test. It says this will be replaced by a test using human immune cells in a dish.All tests that used animals to check for dangerous germs in medicine will also be done with cell and gene technologies, the government says.Between 2026 and 2035, the government plans to speed up the use of non-animal techniques, including the organ-on-a-chip devices and artificial intelligence.The proposals group animal tests into two main groups: those which could be immediately replaced because safe and effective alternatives already exist and simply need laws or guidelines to be updated; and others, where alternatives exist, but still need work to prove that they are reliable enough to be widely used.To speed up the latter, the government plans to set up a Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods. Ministers also promise to give an unspecified increase in funding and investment for developing new alternatives, including £30m for a research hub and more grants to support innovative methods and training.The RSPCA has cautiously welcomed the plan, describing it as a \"significant step forward\",  but has urged the government to deliver.Some scientists working with animal experiments, such as Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, are deeply concerned about what they fear may be a premature push toward alternatives, and its potential negative consequences for science and medicine.\"How about the brain and behaviour? How can you study behaviour in a petri dish? You just can't,\" he says.\"With complex areas of biology where no current non-animal model gets anything close to the real biology, how is forcibly pushing this strategy going to help?\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoYvette Tan,Singapore and Hosu Lee,SeoulSquid Game star O Yeong-Su has been acquitted of sexual misconduct charges by a court in South Korea. The 81-year-old was charged in 2022 with sexually assaulting a woman twice.  The allegations said that he hugged the woman and kissed her on the cheek against her will.Mr O was found guilty in 2024 and given an eight-month suspended prison sentence, but said he would appeal against the verdict. On Tuesday, a court overturned his sentence, saying he had undergone classes on sexual violence and suggesting that the alleged victim's memory may have been \"distorted\", considering how long ago the incident occurred. The alleged assaults took place in 2017 when Mr O was staying in a rural area for a theatre performance. The alleged victim filed a complaint against Mr O in 2021, but the case was closed in April the same year. The prosecution later reopened the investigation \"at the request of the victim\", according to Yonhap agency. In a statement reported by local media outlets, the Suwon District Court said there was \"doubt\" as to whether Mr O had committed the assault. \"There is a possibility that the victim's memory has been distorted over time, and when there is doubt... the defendant must be given the benefit of the doubt\".However, the statement also went on to say that it was possible Mr O had committed assault, as he had apologised to the victim.The alleged victim later spoke out against the verdict, saying it would not \"invalidate the truth or erase the pain I have suffered\".\"Despite today's ruling, I will continue to speak the truth to the very end,\" she said in a statement released through women's rights organisation Womenlink. Womenlink also criticised the ruling, saying they were \"outraged by a ruling that once again conceals sexual violence in the theatre world\". It is not yet clear if the prosecution will appeal.Speaking to local media outlets after the court ruling, Mr O said he had \"gratitude to the court for its wise judgement\".Mr O rose to international fame after starring in Squid Game, a dystopian drama which sees people competing in deadly versions of traditional children's games.In 2022, he became the first South Korean actor to win a Golden Globe award for best supporting actor in a series, after his performance in the first season of the chart-topping Netflix thriller.",

    "body": "16 minutes agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad and Dearbail JordanA suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad has killed 12 people and injured at least 27 more, the country's interior minister said.Mohsin Naqvi said a bomber was planning to attack the district courthouse but was unable to get inside.Naqvi said authorities would prioritise identifying the bomber, and that those involved would be brought to justice.Suicide blasts in Islamabad have been rare in recent years. Footage from the scene on Tuesday showed the remains of a burnt out car and a police cordon in place.The 27 people injured are receiving medical treatment, Naqvi said.He added that the attacker detonated the bomb close to a police car after waiting for up to 15 minutes. Footage of the aftermath showed plumes of smoke rising from a charred vehicle behind a security barrier. The incident occurred at 12:39 local time (07:39 GMT).Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said he \"strongly condemned the suicide blast\". A lawyer who said he was parking his car outside the court at the time described hearing a \"loud bang\".Rustam Malik told AFP news agency \"it was complete chaos\".\"Lawyers and people were running inside the complex,\" he added. \"I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate and several cars were on fire.\"No-one has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has claimed that extremist groups \"actively backed by India\" were involved.In a statement, he said that \"terrorist attacks on unarmed citizens of Pakistan by India's terrorist proxies are condemnable\".Delhi has not responded to the accusations. It has previously denied such claims.In a separate incident on Monday, a car exploded in India's capital Delhi, killing eight people and injuring a number of others. The Indian government has not called the incident a terror attack, although the case has been referred to the country's anti-terror body.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said following the attack: \"The conspirators behind this heinous act will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice, no matter how deep the conspiracy runs.\"There is, however, no official word yet on what led to the blast.The last time Pakistan's capital was targeted by a suicide bombing was three years ago when a police officer was killed and several others injured.There have been suicide attacks in other parts of the country in the years since but not in Islamabad.

    "body": "'There was blood everywhere': Delhi residents recount horror of huge car explosion5 hours agoVikas Pandey and Antriksha PathaniaBBC News, DelhiBBCMohammed Azghar says that his brother has been missing since the blastMonday evening was busy as usual near the Red Fort metro station in India's capital Delhi when the sound of a loud blast broke through the cacophony on the streets.An explosion in a car killed at least eight people and injured more than 20. It was so powerful that several vehicles nearby almost melted, and people could hear the blast from kilometres away.The police are still investigating what caused the blast but the fact that it happened in one of the most secure and busy areas of Delhi has shocked people.On one side is Chandni Chowk - a busy trading and clothing hub that is busier than usual at this time of the year due to the peak wedding season.And on the other side is the 17th Century Red Fort which attracts thousands of tourists every day.Sandwiched between the two is the road where the explosion took place. Within minutes, confusion and alarm spread from the scene to the rest of the city.Some readers may find the details below disturbingMohamed Hafiz, who lives less than 200m from the spot, said his house shook and he and others ran out thinking it was an earthquake.What he saw on the street terrified him: people were running in all directions, cars were on fire, and bodies lay on the road. Some locals were trying to help the injured.\"There was blood everywhere. People were in shock. The scene was too disturbing - I could even see body parts,\" he said.As local media broke the news, fear and panic swept through the city. Police declared a high alert, and neighbouring states quickly followed suit.ReutersA member from the forensic team investigates the area where the blast took placeAs we entered Delhi from the neighbouring suburb of Noida, we could see a long queue of vehicles at the border as policemen searched them one by one.Everyone - the people in the vehicles and the policemen - looked tense as they all appeared to be in disbelief that something like this had happened in their city for the first time in more than a decade.Beyond the crossing, most roads were deserted as we drove to Lok Nayak Hospital, where the injured had been taken. Outside, a large crowd had gathered behind police cordons. Confusion hung in the air as people searched for answers, and fellow journalists speculated about what might have caused the explosion.Onlookers were mystified and even scared. Rajesh Kumar, who works at a tea shop near the hospital, said he always believed the capital was the safest city in the country.He said that though the blast had shaken him, he still believed that the security forces would soon find out what caused it.\"My family in Uttar Pradesh [state] told me to leave, they panic easily. I am a little worried and shocked but I don't think Delhi has suddenly become unsafe,\" he said.Among the crowd were also several people who were looking for missing family members.One of them was Mohammed Azghar, whose brother was in the area where the blast took place.\"My brother has been missing since the explosion. We haven't had any contact with him,\" he said.\"We've searched around Red Fort, Chandni Chowk, everywhere but we can't find him.\"Mr Azghar said his brother used to drive an electric rickshaw. \"The police have confiscated the vehicle, which is fine, we don't mind that. But at least help us find my brother.\"I just want some news - good or bad.\"The injured were taken to Lok Nayak Hospital in DelhiAfter visiting the hospital, we drove to the site of the blast. It was jarring to see the roads empty here, as the area is usually teeming with people late into the night.There were only security personnel or journalists around. Officials had relaxed restrictions and journalists could go closer to the site.The scene there told the story of the blast. There were mangled remains of cars, rickshaws and tuk-tuks. Blood stains could still be seen on the road. Some of the vehicles were charred beyond recognition.Some locals had also gathered around. They looked visibly shaken and worried about their immediate future.Ram Singh, who drives a small vehicle to ferry goods from stockrooms to shops in the area, is worried about business being affected.\"I earn daily and I am worried how I might feed my family. I hope a sense of security soon returns. I hope the police will be able to restore trust fairly quickly,\" he said.\"And I hope this never happens in our city ever again. We are shaken but we should overcome this.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr at the White House & Raffi BergWatch: 'If you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance', says Trump on al-SharaaSyria will join the international coalition to combat the Islamic State group, marking a shift in US foreign policy in the Middle East, a senior Trump administration official has confirmed. The announcement came as President Donald Trump met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House - the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.In an interview with Special Report on Fox News, al-Sharaa said the visit was part of a \"new era\" in which the country would co-operate with the US. Trump has expressed his support for al-Sharaa, who until recently was designated a terrorist by the US government.Syria will now be the 90th country to join the global coalition, which is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East. Following the meeting, a senior administration official also confirmed that the US Treasury Department, along with the departments of state and commerce, will announce new measures to lift economic restrictions on Syria and provide \"compliance clarity for investors\".As part of the measures, the administration is also issuing an 180-day suspension of the Caesar Act, which since 2019 had sanctioned the former Syrian government.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office several hours after the meeting, Trump said that \"we want to see Syria become a country that's very successful.\" \"And I think this leader can do it,\" he added. \"I really do.\" Diplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although the US will now allow Syria to re-open its embassy in Washington. This is the third meeting between the two leaders, following one in May on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council and a dinner during the UN General Assembly in September. Al-Sharaa's visit to the White House caps a remarkable re-branding for the former jihadist. Not long ago, he led a branch of Al-Qaeda - the group behind the 9/11 attacks and many others - before breaking off ties. Even until this year, he was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed Islamist group which the US officially considered a terrorist organisation until four months ago, with a $10m bounty on his head. The Treasury Department removed al-Sharaa from its \"specially designated global terrorist list\" just last week.But since becoming interim Syrian president, al-Sharaa has worked to soften his public image as he tries to rebuild Syria, with foreign support, following 13 years of war. \"He has had a rough past,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And I think, frankly, if you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance.\" In his interview, al-Sharaa said that he and Trump had not discussed his past, but instead focused on the \"present and the future\" of Syria in which it was a \"geopolitical\" and economic partner of Washington. Al-Sharaa's rule, however, has been marred by killings of members of Syria's Alawite minority, as well as by deadly violence between Sunni Bedouin fighters and Druze militias.He has vowed to root out members of his security forces that have committed human rights violations. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed support for al-Sharaa, referring to him as a \"young, attractive guy\" and a \"fighter\". In June, President Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against Syria, which the White House said would help support the country's \"path to stability and peace\". At the time, the administration said it would monitor the new Syrian government's actions, including \"taking steps toward normalising ties with Israel\" and addressing \"foreign terrorists\" and militant groups operating in the country.

    "body": "8 hours agoKelly Ng,Singapore, Jonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Lulu Luo,Cabanatuan, PhilippinesAt least six people have died after a super typhoon barrelled through the Philippines, mere days after an earlier storm left more than 200 people dead.Super typhoon Fung-wong brought floods and landslides, which caused most of the deaths. It also cut power across entire provinces. It later weakened into a typhoon. More than 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead of it making landfall in the Philippines. It is now heading for Taiwan, where more than 3,000 people have been evacuated.Fung-wong was the 21st typhoon to hit the South East Asian nation this year, at a time where many residents are still struggling to recover from back-to-back natural disasters.Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, slammed into Aurora province on Luzon Sunday night with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h.The Philippines' meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.In Cabanatuan, one of the worst-hit cities, the BBC saw residents rushing into their homes to pull out furniture and pets on Monday, desperate to salvage as many of their possessions possible as water levels rose.Although its wind speeds did not come up to par with some of the strongest storms in the Philippines' history, Fung-wong dumped large amounts of rain on the country, leaving some 4,100 houses either totally destroyed or partially damaged.Cabanatuan resident Mercidita Adriano and her family had trimmed trees near their home last week to prepare for the storm.When the winds and rain intensified, ten of them crowded into a small room, praying throughout the day that the typhoon would spare their house, she told the BBC. Part of their roof was torn off by the heavy rain.Large parts of the country are still under water although the levels have gone down as of Tuesday morning. It comes just days after typhoon Kalmaegi ripped through the same region, leaving tens of thousands of people reeling. And in September, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the province of Cebu.While the Philippines is prone to natural disasters, this series of catastrophes is \"not routine\", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement on Sunday.\"It is a stark reminder of the escalating climate and seismic risks faced by vulnerable nations. Urgent support is needed to scale up relief efforts, prevent further loss of life and support the country as it recovers from this latest disaster,\" it said. ",

    "body": "18 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporter, Belém, BrazilShutterstockBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaks during the opening of the COP30 conferences in Belem, Brazil.The world must \"defeat\" climate denialism and fight fake news, Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has told the opening meeting of the UN climate talks. In a rallying cry to COP30, President Lula again made thinly veiled references to President Donald Trump who branded climate change \"a con job\" in September.The two weeks of talks kicked off on Monday in the lush Brazilian city of Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest.They take place against a fraught political backdrop and the US has sent no senior officials.On Monday thousands of delegates poured into the COP venue in a heavily air-conditioned former aerodrome, some coming from accommodation in shipping containers and cruise ships moored on the riverside.Members of the Guajajara indigenous group, in traditional dress, performed a welcome song and dance for assembled diplomats.Addressing the conference, President Lula said \"COP30 will be the COP of truth\" in an era of \"fake news and misrepresentation\" and \"rejection of scientific evidence\".Without naming President Trump, President Lula continued, \"they control the algorithms, sow hatred and spread fear\".\"It's time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers,\" he said.ReutersSince President Trump took office in January, he has promised to invest heavily in fossil fuels, saying that this will secure greater economic prosperity for the US.His administration has cancelled more than $13bn of funding for renewable energy and is taking steps to open up more areas of the US to oil and gas exploration.That puts the country at odds with the majority of nations still committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green energy.UNFCCThe latest UN climate talks talk place in Belém, a city of 1.5 million people in northern BrazilThis backdrop has put the COP talks in a difficult position as nations aim to make progress on tackling climate change without the participation of the world's biggest economy.Some delegates fear that the US could still decide to send officials to undermine the talks. Other environmental talks collapsed this year following US pressure, labelled \"bully-boy tactics\" by some participants.Addressing officials in Belém, UN climate chief Simon Stiell initially struck an optimistic tone. He said significant progress had been made in the last decade to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases.But then he took aim at \"squabbling\" between countries.\"Not one single nation among you can afford this, as climate disasters rip double-digits off GDP,\" he said.Brazil wants to use its presidency of the talks to secure progress on key promises made in previous years.That includes moving away from the use of planet-warming fossil fuels, finance for developing countries on the frontline of climate change, and protecting nature.President Lula's centrepiece is a fund called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that Brazil hopes will raise $125bn to protect tropical forests globally.Fund-raising got off to a slow start. Last week UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, at the last minute, that the UK would not contribute public money.But on Monday, UK climate envoy Rachel Kyte told BBC News that the fund was a \"brilliant idea\" and that the UK \"will make the investment at some point\".After a fight, nations finally agreed a conference agenda on Monday.It promises to consider the question of whether countries can still work towards keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.Groups on the frontline of climate change, including coalition called Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) that mostly represents Caribbean and Pacific countries, had insisted the talks address the long-held goal.In recent weeks even the UN has said it accepts that overshooting this temperature is \"inevitable\".Last week UN General Secretary General António Guterres told leaders in Belém that the failure to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C was a \"moral failure and deadly negligence\".Additional reporting by Esme Stallard",

    "body": "3 days agoNick ThorpeBudapest, HungaryOn the surface, the Hungarian prime minister's trip was exactly what he went to Washington for: luxuriant praise and an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, gas and nuclear supplies.And all that just five months out from a difficult election.Look closer, however, and the picture is less clear cut. The US side struck a hard trade deal - and an expensive one for Hungary. And there's no progress on Viktor Orban's biggest headache: ending the war in neighbouring Ukraine, and with it the long shadow the conflict casts over Hungary.Let's look first at Orban's key win - an exemption from US sanctions, which a White House official told the BBC was time-limited to one year, although Péter Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign minister, said would be indefinite.The time span is interesting. Trump clearly wants to help his friend win the election in April. And the exemption even partially dovetails with the European Commission demand to all member states to end the import of Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuel by the end of 2027. What is missing, from an EU perspective, is any political commitment from Orban to meet that demand - a commitment made and fulfilled by the Czech government. And the EU is trying to tighten energy sanctions - to the fury of Hungary and Slovakia.Away from the media spotlight, the Hungarian energy company MOL has been upgrading two of its refineries - Százhalombatta in Hungary and the Slovnaft facility in Bratislava - to process Brent crude instead of the high-sulphur Urals crude which flows through Russian pipelines. On Friday, MOL said 80% of its oil needs could be imported through the Adria pipeline from Croatia, albeit with higher logistical costs and technical risks. So Orban's argument, which so impressed Trump, that Hungary, as a landlocked country, has no alternative to Russian oil may not strictly be true. Overall, Hungary and Slovakia have together paid Russia $13bn (£10bn) for its oil between its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the end of 2024. The one-year window granted by the US is nevertheless a valuable respite for Hungarian households this winter. Orban told pro-government reporters who travelled with him to Washington that otherwise utility bills \"could have gone up by up to three times in December\". Capping those bills by various means has been a central plank of his popularity in Hungary since 2013. Under the US exemption, Hungary can also continue to buy Russian gas through the Turkstream pipeline, which traverses the Balkans, and pay for it in hard currency ($185m in August alone) using a Bulgarian loophole. Orban has agreed to buy LNG from the US worth $600 million, according to Bloomberg.Another key part of the Washington deal is nuclear. Hungary agreed to buy US nuclear fuel rods for its Paks 1 nuclear power station (at a cost of $114m), in parallel to those bought from Russia's Rosatom and France's Framatome.Russian plans to finance and build the nuclear extension, called Paks 2, have been long delayed by technical and licensing issues. The US agreement to lift all nuclear sanctions on Hungary may help restart that project, but thorny problems remain. Hungary has also agreed to buy US technology to extend the short-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at Paks for between $100m and $200m.Perhaps the biggest part of the deal was a Hungarian commitment to buy up to 10 small modular nuclear reactors from the US, for somewhere between $10bn and $20bn. Hungary needs electricity to power the huge Chinese battery plants being built around the country. Smaller nuclear plants are less plagued by building delays, and are easier to licence.Finally, a currency swap deal - similar to a recent US-Argentina deal to prop up the peso - under which US and Hungarian central banks can exchange currency is being discussed.This would mean that in a future financial crisis in Hungary, the US central bank could feed dollars to Budapest, which boosts financial security in Hungary.So in summary, Hungary struck a deal to buy US gas, nuclear energy and unspecified weapons systems in exchange for a temporary waiver from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas. But it failed to get the re-introduction of the US-Hungary dual taxation system, abolished in 2022, which harms mutual trade. And it did not get a new date for a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest as part of efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Critics say energy dependence on Russia is being replaced by energy dependence on the US. The Orban government argues it is achieving greater diversity of supply.",

    "body": "19 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent in RomeA Ukrainian former military officer is on the 10th day of a hunger strike in an Italian prison, where he has accused the authorities of mistreating him to make him confess to blowing up Russia's Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea in 2022.Serhiy Kuznetsov was detained in Italy in August on an arrest warrant from Germany.In a letter shown to the BBC by his lawyer, Mr Kuznetsov says he is being treated as \"criminal no.1\", held in a high-security facility alongside suspected members of so-called Islamic State (IS or Isis). The BBC has contacted the prison, but it has not yet commented.No-one has admitted carrying out the attack on the pipelines carrying Russian gas to Germany.In his first public comment since his arrest, Mr Kuznetsov writes - by hand - that \"the Italians have been cynically ignoring my dietary habits for the past two months\" - a reference to his vegetarian diet.\"They think that these restrictions can affect my position, and make me confess my guilt. But such efforts are futile.\"A relative of Mr Kuznetsov's told me they had tried to deliver special food to the prison, but had been refused - and they were worried that he seemed \"exhausted\".The Nord Stream pipelines were destroyed deep beneath the Baltic Sea at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It was a high profile and controversial attack.Many initially suspected Russian involvement and an attempt by Moscow to blackmail Europe by restricting its energy supplies.But this summer, German prosecutors activated arrest warrants for two of the men they suspect of carrying out the attack: Serhiy Kuznetsov and a second Ukrainian citizen, Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was detained in Poland.German prosecutors have cited charges of \"anti-constitutional sabotage\" as a basis for the extradition requests.A judge in Warsaw ruled against Mr Zhuravlyov's extradition, saying that, if Ukrainians were involved, such an attack would count as legitimate self-defence in a \"bloody, genocidal war\".In Italy, by contrast, a court in Bologna last month approved Serhiy Kuznetsov's extradition in a closed hearing. He is currently appealing against that ruling for a second time.\"He told me he had lost 9kg when I said that his clothes were hanging loosely,\" the Ukrainian's lawyer, Nicola Canestrini, said, after visiting his client on hunger strike.The lawyer said Kuznetsov was refusing all solid food but was \"doing fine and is clear of mind\".Serhiy Kuznetsov complains in his letter about having to exercise in isolation and under armed guard and being subjected to \"maximum restrictions\".His lawyer told the BBC that he himself felt that Mr Kuznetsov had been \"abandoned\" by the Ukrainian government \"like an old boot\".\"He was in the army, so they should know was he there or not? If he was there, they should protect him - if not, they should protect him as well,\" he argues, referring to the attack.Ukrainian officials have always denied any involvement. They declined to comment again recently when approached by the BBC.On Sunday, the human rights ombudsman in Kyiv, Dmytro Lubinets, said an adviser was looking into the case and would check on the prison conditions.In his letter, Mr Kuznetsov says that he understands that his government \"currently has more important matters to attend to, searching for an end to the war\".He ends on a patriotic note, writing: \"I love Ukraine very much and am happy to have the honour of being an officer in its armed forces.\"His final appeal hearing in Italy is due in the next couple of weeks.",

They are sending out a message that foreign nationals are not safe in the UK,\" she told the BBC.Roughly two months before Harshita was killed, on 3 September, she had filed a case of domestic abuse against her husband. He was arrested and later released on bail on condition that he did not harass, pester or intimidate Harshita. The Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) expired four weeks later, on 1 October.Sonia accuses Northamptonshire Police of being negligent in following up on the domestic abuse case. \"That's when Pankaj figured out that the UK police are not really serious about this case and he felt he could get away with murder,\" she says.Four officers of the Northamptonshire Police are being investigated over their handling of Harshita's domestic abuse report and their interaction with her, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).The IOPC told the BBC this week that their investigation was complete and had been shared with Northamptonshire Police. Northamptonshire Police say they have been given until mid-November to respond to the IOPC's findings.Northamptonshire Police said: \"This is an exceptionally complex case and with criminal proceedings now active in the UK, we are unable to go into detail about the investigation at this time. However, we can confirm that the Indian authorities have been made aware through the appropriate channels of the charging decision.\"The Indian government has told the BBC they are in touch with the UK government on the matter, but neither side answered clearly about whether an extradition notice for Pankaj Lamba had been forwarded to the Indian authorities.Ms Brella detailed the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband in a letterHarshita's family also told the BBC that they believe Pankaj Lamba is in India, being shielded by Indian police.\"He has relatives who are policemen. In March this year, he was seen on CCTV footage withdrawing money from a bank. Then how come he's not been found yet? This is all because of corruption,\" says Sonia. The family also says they have information that in the early months of this year, Pankaj was running a shop in Gurgaon, not far from where they live.\"They [the Delhi Police] are just killing time,\" Sonia says.The Delhi Police did not respond to Sonia's accusations. They told the BBC that they have acted on the basis of a dowry complaint filed by Harshita's parents against Mr Lamba and members of his family, including his parents and sister, who were arrested and are now out on bail. The Delhi Police also say they issued public notices earlier this year offering a reward for information about Mr Lamba, and the search for him is still under way.Harshita's mother Sudesh Kumari says she still cannot believe her daughter is gonePankaj Lamba's family home is in the village of Dharauli, about 40 miles (65km) north of Delhi, and not far from Gurgaon where Ms Brella's family believe he was sighted in March. His parents Sudesh and Darshan Lamba didn't want to be interviewed when the BBC visited. But they rejected all the charges against them and their son. They claim they have not had any contact with him since 10 November 2024 – the same day that Harshita's family last had contact with her.For Harshita's father, Satbir Singh Brella, the days are filled with visits to police stations and courts.\"My daughter was so straightforward, and kind hearted. A really terrible thing happened to her,\" he says.Her mother points to the shoes she's wearing. They're Harshita's and were among her possessions from the UK returned to her family by British officials who visited them in July.\"They are tight for me, but I feel close to her when I wear them,\" says Sudesh Kumari. \"Sometimes I feel she's still in the UK, I cannot believe she is gone.\"Additional reporting: Aakriti Thapar, Adnan Bhat, Sanjay Ganguly",

When will you admit that it's a crime? I am ashamed for you.\"</p><p>She also addressed the devastation that had engulfed her family since the trial. </p><p>Her daughter, Caroline Darian, maintains she too was drugged and abused by her father after photos showing her unconscious were found on Pelicot's computer. </p><p>Ms Darian has since spoken about feeling unsupported by her mother. The two are reportedly no longer in contact and Ms Darian was not in court with Gisèle this week.</p><p>\"My family is trying to rebuild itself however it can,\" Gisèle said. \"I hope [Caroline] finds the answers she is looking for. I hope one day we can find each other again.\"</p><p>She also asked to stop being referred to as an icon. \"I am an ordinary woman who dared to open up her trial,\" she said. \"I have become an icon against my will.\"</p><p>As in the original trial, Gisèle ended her statement with a thought for other victims of rape – the majority of whom did not have the wealth of evidence that she had to bring her abusers to court.</p><p>\"I want to say to them to never be ashamed of what was inflicted upon us, because it is not their fault,\" she said.</p></div></article>",

A White House official responded by saying the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\" .</p><p>Announcing the recipient of the prize at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo on Friday, the committee warned that \"democracy is in retreat\" across the world.</p><p>Machado - who has been forced to live in hiding for much of the past year - was recognised for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\", Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said.</p><p>She has been a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided... in a brutal authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis\", he added.</p><p>\"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.\"</p></div><div><p>Machado - who has long been one of the most respected voices in Venezuela's opposition - was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office. </p><p>The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.</p><p>Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.</p><p>When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest.</p><p>Machado expressed shock in response to the award, saying it was the \"achievement of a whole society\".</p><p>\"I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve this,\" she said in a video message.</p><p>González, meanwhile, wrote on social media that the prize was \"well-deserved recognition for the long struggle of a woman and of an entire people for our freedom and democracy\".</p><p>Frydnes was critical of Venezuela's leadership during a news conference after the prize was announced, saying the committee saw the same trends emerging around the world.</p><p>\"[The] rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation,\" he said.</p><p>He added that he hoped Machado would be able to attend the award ceremony in Oslo in December but acknowledged the serious security situation.</p></div><div><p>There were 338 candidates nominated for this year's peace prize, according to the Nobel Committee - though the names of the nominees will not be revealed for 50 years, as per tradition.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly said that he deserves the award, on one occasion declaring that \"everyone says I should get it\".</p><p>A number of world leaders backed his bid, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cnvm2ngnpe1o\">Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, who publicly revealed a nomination letter while visiting the White House</a>, as well as the governments of Pakistan and Azerbaijan - despite nominations closing in January, just as Trump's second term began.</p><p>Asked whether pressure from the US president and some in the international community to award Trump the prize had impacted the committee's deliberations, Frydnes said there had been many campaigns and \"media tension\" in the \"long history\" of the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>\"We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,\" he said.</p><p>Reacting to Friday's announcement, the White House's communications director Steven Cheung wrote in a post on X that the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\".</p><p>\"President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives.</p><p>\"He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will,\" Cheung added.</p><p>The Nobel Prize, which is split into six categories, celebrates the work of people or organisations that have contributed \"the greatest benefit to humankind\".</p><p>Frydnes said that Machado met \"all the criteria\" laid out by Nobel for the prize, and \"embodies hope for the future\".</p></div><div><p><span>More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

    "body": "<div><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges by a grand jury. </p><p>James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. </p><p>Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. </p><p>In a statement, James accused the president - who recently publicly pressured prosecutors to file criminal charges against her - of a \"desperate weaponization of our justice system\".</p></div><div><p>\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general,\" she said. </p><p>\"These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.\"</p><p>The US prosecutor assigned to the case, Lindsey Halligan, meanwhile, said the case proved that \"no one is above the law\". </p><p>\"The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" she said. </p><p>\"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump's only goal is \"political retribution\" - Letitia James responds to indictment</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Trump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.</p><p>James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.</p><p>The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home. </p><p>The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead \"used as a rental investment property\", which was being rented to a family of three.</p><p>The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.</p><p>Halligan said that, if convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison per count and up to a $1 million (£751,755) fine on each count.</p><p>James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said: \"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"</p><p>Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. </p><p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.</p><p>James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress.</p><p>The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.</p><p>In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. </p><p>During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a \"political witch hunt\" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law\". </p><p>James on Thursday said she stands behind her office's litigation against Trump and his organisation. </p><p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said James's indictment \"is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable.\"</p><p>The New York Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union called it \"the latest in a long list of brazen abuses of power by President Trump\".</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>The Kenyan Catholic Church has introduced a new brand of altar wine for Holy Mass after the previous one became widely available in local bars.</p><p>Simply labelled Mass Wine, the new sacramental drink bears the coat of arms of the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) and an official signature to certify its authenticity. </p><p>\"The newly approved wine is not for sale at any business outlet, but is imported and owned by the KCCB, and only distributed to the dioceses,\" Archbishop of Nyeri Anthony Muheria told the BBC. </p><p>The move has been welcomed by the Catholic faithful, who believe that the previous brand had lost its sanctity due to its widespread use outside the church. </p></div><div><p>Wine is used at Mass to symbolise the blood of Jesus Christ and is normally drunk by the priest. On some occasions, it is given to the congregation as well.</p><p>The composition of the wine is regulated by the Catholic Church's Canon Law, according to Archbishop Muheria. </p><p>\"Vigilance on the quality and standards of the wine and hosts [bread used to symbolise the body of Christ] used in the Mass is given to the Catholic bishops of the country. This is reviewed from time to time,\" the archbishop added. </p><p>The old wine, which was distributed by a local alcohol manufacturer, was widely sold in liquor shops, hotels, bars and supermarkets.</p><p>\"It has become common that unfortunately, the former wine is readily available in secular outlets and bars,\" Archbishop Muheria told the BBC. </p><p>After exploring several wine options, the Catholic Church in Kenya settled on a South African vintage. </p></div><div><p>The new wine was officially introduced for the first time to thousands of worshipers during this year's National Prayer Day at the Subukia National Marian Shrine in Kenya's Nakuru area on Saturday. </p><p>\"This is the only wine that will be used in Mass celebrations across the country, going forward,\" said Archbishop Maurice Muhatia Makumba, the KCCB chairman, as he held a bottle of the new sacramental wine.</p><p>He directed all Catholic churches in the country to discontinue use of the old wine and urged priests to familiarise themselves with the new distribution guidelines and authorised outlets.</p><p>\"The newly approved wine is not for sale at any business outlet,\" said Archbishop Muheria, adding that the new drink was imported and owned by the KCCB.</p><p>\"This assures purity from source.\" </p><p>The label on the new wine reads: \"The fruit of the vine and the work of human hands will become our cup of joy\" - a reflection of the wine's sacred purpose.</p><p>Altar wine, popularly known as divai in Swahili language, is consumed differently across dioceses, depending on the liturgical season and the level of church activity. </p><p>Demand peaks during Easter, Christmas, and other major religious events. </p><p>Some members of the Catholic community welcomed the introduction of the new wine, expressing concern that the old was being sold casually in shops like any ordinary drink, diminishing its sacred significance. </p><p>\"It is a valid step toward preserving the sacredness of the Eucharist and ensuring that only properly prepared wine is used for Mass,\" one Catholic told BBC. </p><p>More than 80% of Kenya's 50 million poeple identify as Christians. Of these, around 10 million - about 20% of the total population - are Catholic, according to government statistics. </p><p>Other Christians belong to a variety of evangelical churches and other denominations, including the Anglican Church of Kenya and the Presbyterian Church.</p></div>",

Discord did not name the third-party company involved.</p><p>A representative from Zendesk, a customer service software provider for Discord, told the BBC that its systems had not been compromised and that the breach did was not caused by a vulnerability within its platform.</p><p>Some online commentators have claimed that the data breach was bigger than Discord has revealed.</p><p>A spokesperson for Discord told the BBC that those claims are inaccurate and \"part of an attempt to extort payment\". The spokesperson said the breach was not a ransomware attack.</p><p>\"We will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions,\" the spokesperson added.</p><p>Cybercriminals frequently target personal data, which can command a high price on the black market for use in scams.</p><p>Information like full names and official ID numbers is especially valuable because, unlike credit card details, it typically remains unchanged over time.</p><p>Discord has previously <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr75wypg0vo\">strengthened its age-verification measures</a> in response to concerns that some servers on the platform were being used to distribute pornographic and extremist material.</p></div>",

He had argued he was under duress when he was forced to throw the bodies into the pig enclosure.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gemjql1r5o\">South African farm worker says he was forced to feed women to pigs</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0jwq58z7vgo\">Outrage over farmer accused of feeding women to pigs</a></li></ul><p>On Thursday, Mr De Wet told Polokwane High Court that he and Mr Olivier, 60, armed themselves with hunting rifles and waited for trespassers to enter the farm on the night of 17 August 2024. </p><p>He said after waiting for 30 minutes they heard voices of people talking and walking towards their direction. </p><p>They then opened fire and heard a person screaming, before inspecting the area and finding a person lying face down. </p><p>After leaving the area and going to sleep, they returned the next morning and found it was the body of a woman. </p><p>Mr De Wet said he was asked by Mr Olivier to help him throw the body inside the enclosure where eight to ten big adult pigs were kept. </p><p>The following day another body was found about 25 metres from where the first was found. </p><p>Mr Olivier, Mr De Wet and Mr Musora, 50, are said to have then thrown the second body inside the pigsty. </p><p>On the following Tuesday they returned to it and found that the pigs had bitten off large chunks of flesh on the women. </p><p>Pictures presented as exhibits in court show missing buttocks, face, thighs and shoulders. </p><p>State prosecutor Advocate George Sekhukhune asked Mr De Wet what the purpose of placing the bodies inside the pigsty was, to which he answered: \"We were disposing the evidence because when pigs are hungry enough, they'll eat anything.\"</p><p>Mr De Wet also said Mr Olivier chopped up the hunting rifles with an angle grinder and burnt the wooden parts of the gun. They then threw away the cut up weapons including the spent cartridges inside a borehole.</p><p>The son of victim Ms Makgato cried repeatedly in court, while Mr Olivier was seen wiping away tears as Mr De Wet gave his evidence.</p><p>The case has sparked outrage across South Africa, exacerbating racial tensions between black and white people in the country.</p><p>This is especially rife in rural areas of the country, despite the end of the racist system of apartheid 30 years ago.</p><p>Most private farmland remains in the hands of the white minority, while most farm workers are black and poorly paid, fuelling resentment among the black population, while many white farmers complain of high crime rates.</p><p>Cross examination by defence lawyers of Mr Olivier and Mr Musora will resume next Wednesday.</p></div>",

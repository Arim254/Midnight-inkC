    "body": "Three French teens drown after car crashes upside down in swimming pool19 hours agoLaura GozziAFPFirefighters were called several hours after the accident to remove the car from the pool (file pic)Three teenagers were killed when their car skidded off the road in southern France, went through a wall and crashed upside down in a private pool, trapping them inside. The vehicle was a similar size to the pool and the teenagers - aged 14, 15 and 19 - were unable to open the doors and drowned.The freak accident occurred in the town of Alès in the early hours of Wednesday. \"It's truly the height of horror,\" said public prosecutor Abdelkrim Grini. \"It wasn't the impact of the accident that killed them. They found themselves upside down in icy water, unable to get out. They had no chance.\" Unconfirmed reports suggest the youngest of the three victims was at the wheel of the car at the time.The accident, which happened during a night of heavy rain, was the result of an \"unbelievable series of circumstances,\" the prosecutor told AFP news agency.The prosecutor described how the car had smashed through a low-level garden wall, flipped over and landed \"with all four wheels in the air\".It was not for several hours that the alarm was raised and firefighters were called to drain the pool and remove the vehicle. BFMTV reported that the pool was about 1.5m (5ft) deep.A mangled car was pulled on to a firefighters' truck during the morning and video from the scene showed the private swimming pool next to the collapsed wall. Canisters of nitrous oxide were found in the car, according to French reports. The substance is used by recreational users as it can make people feel relaxed, light-headed or dizzy.An investigation has been opened into the cause of death. The three victims' bodies  have been taken to the forensic institute in Nîmes for post mortem examinations, AFP said.",

    "body": "Singapore's opposition leader Pritam Singh has lost his appeal against a guilty verdict of lying to a parliamentary committee.In February, Singh was fined S$14,000 ($10,800; £8,100) for two charges related to his handling of Raeesah Khan, a former lawmaker from his party who confessed to lying to parliament.In a short hearing to a packed court public gallery on Friday, the judge said Singh's conviction was supported by the evidence provided.Singh, who leads the main opposition Workers' Party, said that he was \"disappointed\" with the decision but accepted it \"fully and without reservation\". He paid his fines at the courthouse after the hearing on Friday. \"Might as well get it done,\" he told reporters.Singh retains his seat in parliament despite the conviction, and said on Friday that he would keep serving Singaporeans along with his colleagues.The Workers' Party is the the only opposition party in Singapore's current parliament, where it holds 12 out of 99 seats.The saga began in 2021, when Khan claimed in parliament that she had witnessed the police misbehave towards a sexual assault victim.She later admitted that her anecdote was not true, but said during a parliamentary committee investigation that the party's leaders, including Singh, had told her to \"continue with the narrative\" despite knowing about the lie.Khan has since resigned from the party and parliament. She was fined S$35,000 for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege.In February, the court ruled that Singh's actions were \"strongly indicative\" that he had not wanted Khan to clarify her lie.But Singh, who maintained his innocence throughout the trial, argued that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue.During Singh's appeal hearing in November, his lawyer argued that the court had \"ignored crucial pieces of evidence\" in its ruling.Singh's lawyer also sought to cast doubt on the credibility of Khan and her aides, who served as witnesses.When the judge asked why Singh seemed to be \"doing nothing\" to get Khan to own up in the weeks after learning about her lie in parliament, Singh's lawyer said that he had other urgent professional and personal matters to deal with.However, the prosecution argued that Singh's inaction, along with other pieces of evidence, proved that he had never intended for Khan to come clean.Singh's case stands out as one of the only criminal convictions against a sitting opposition lawmaker.Critics have previously accused Singapore's government of using the judiciary to go after its political opponents - charges the authorities have always denied.",

Witnesses said the initial strike had targeted a tent inside the al-Mawasi displacement area, followed by blasts near the Kuwait hospital, prompting panic among families sheltering nearby.Hamas called Israel's action barbaric, indiscriminate and a violation of the ceasefire which began on 10 October.The Israeli military launched its offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 70,100 Palestinians have since been killed as a result of Israel's campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

Officer Martin said the animal had fallen through one of the ceiling tiles before going \"on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything\". Only one blurry CCTV image of the boozy break-in exists, so it's unknown just how much alcohol the thirsty creature consumed before passing out in the bathroom.In a social media post, the store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter for its professionalism and providing its visitor with a \"sober ride home\".Officer Martin said it was \"just another day in the life of an animal control officer\".

    "body": "Israel has identified the body it received via the Red Cross on Wednesday as 43-year-old Thai agricultural worker, Suthisak Rintalak, according to the prime minister's office.Rintalak was one of the last two deceased hostages still in Gaza. The body of the last remaining hostage, Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer, remains in Gaza.Israel received the coffin carrying Rintalak after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) military wing said it had found a hostage's body in northern Gaza.The handover came hours after the Israeli prime minister's office said tests showed another set of remains received from Hamas on Tuesday did not belong to either of the dead hostages.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they informed Rintalak's family of the news and expressed their \"deep condolences\".They added that they will continue to push for the return of the body of Gvili, urging Hamas to \"make the necessary efforts\" to return him to his family.Israeli officials are coordinating with the Thai embassy in Israel for Rintalak's remains to be returned to Thailand, the prime minister's office said in a statement.Israeli and Thai authorities say both hostages were killed during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and that their bodies were then taken to Gaza.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of four foreign hostages - two of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.The dead hostage still in Gaza was among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "South Korean authorities are developing a mobile app for stalking victims to track in real-time the location of their stalkers, if they're nearby.The app, announced by South Korea's justice ministry on Wednesday, is part of an approved amendment to the country's electronic monitoring law.Stalkers have become a subject of public concern in South Korea, especially as high-profile crimes involving stalking have made headlines in recent years.Under the current law, stalking victims can receive text message alerts when their stalkers are nearby - though these do not reveal stalkers' exact locations.This makes it difficult for victims to determine the direction of the perpetrator, the justice ministry said in a statement.Under the revised law, victims will be allowed to see their stalker's location on a map with their smartphones, allowing them to evacuate to safety.Authorities track stalkers' whereabouts using wearable electronic devices.The justice ministry said it was also working on integrating the tracking system into the national emergency hotline, so police could be deployed to protect victims as needed.This integration is expected to be completed next year, local media reported.Critics have voiced concern over the pervasiveness of stalking in South Korea, which they see as part of a wider problem of violence against women - many of whom have been secretly filmed by spy cameras and faced hostile threats for being feminists.In 2022, public anger erupted over the murder of a young woman by her male ex-colleague, who had been stalking her for years. Although she had reported him to the police, he was not detained or given a restraining order as authorities viewed him as \"low risk\".In 2021, South Korea introduced an anti-stalking law that carries up to three years of jail for offenders and a maximum fine of 30 million Korean won ($20,400; £15,300).In 2023, South Korea's parliament revised the law to lower the barrier to prosecuting stalkers.The number of reports against stalkers have surged since then, from 7,600 in 2022 to more than 13,000 last year, according to data from the justice ministry.",

    "body": "15 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterGetty ImagesCongressman Henry Cuellar was criminally charged last year US President Donald Trump has said he will pardon Democratic congressman Henry Cuellar, who was charged last year with accepting around $600,000 (£478,000) in bribes. On social media, Trump said he would issue a \"full and unconditional\" pardon of the Texas representative and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, who was also charged in the case.\"Henry, I don't know you, but you can sleep well tonight - Your nightmare is finally over!\" the president, a Republican, wrote. He added that he thought Cuellar was charged by former President Joe Biden because he \"bravely spoke out against Open Borders\". Cuellar and his wife, who posted bail after they were charged, maintain their innocence. On Wednesday morning Cuellar filed for re-election as a Democrat, scotching speculation that he might be poised to switch parties and pad the Republicans' narrow majority in the House.Biden's Department of Justice had alleged that Cuellar, who has been representing Texas' 28th congressional district since 2005, illicitly received money from an Azerbaijani government-owned oil company and a Mexican bank.The indictment alleged that, in exchange for the money, Cuellar agreed to influence US foreign policy in favour of Azerbaijan - and to advocate for measures that would benefit the Mexico City bank.Companies owned by Imelda Cuellar allegedly laundered the money, which the family used to pay off debts and make purchases.Among them was $58,000 (£46,000) in credit card payments, $18,000 at wholesale stores and $12,000 for a custom gown, the indictment said.The couple faced charges of conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud, money laundering and violating a ban on acting as agents of a foreign organisation.Though he's a Democrat, Cuellar's politics sit to the right of many members of his party. He's been called the \"last pro-life Democrat\" for his moderate stance on abortion. \"My faith is clear: abortion must be rare and safe,\" he has said in the past. In a letter to Trump, Cuellar's daughters also said they believe their father's stance on immigration may have led to his arrest. They wrote that their father believed in \"securing the border\" and that his \"independence and honesty\" may have been the reason behind his indictment. Trump seemed to agree, saying on Truth Social that Biden \"went after the Congressman, and even the Congressman's wonderful wife, Imelda, simply for speaking the TRUTH\".This is Trump's third act of clemency this week. He pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine to the US, and of possessing machine guns.On Monday, Trump also commuted the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was just days into a seven-year prison sentence for fraud.So far in his second term, the president has pardoned or commuted the sentences of multiple people convicted of various types of fraud or financial crimes.

    "body": "The EU's former foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has been accused of fraud as part of an EU investigation into the misuse of funds, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) has said.The EPPO said searches were carried out on Tuesday at the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, headed by Ms Mogherini, as well as the European External Action Service (EEAS) in Brussels - the office she ran for five years as the bloc's top diplomat.The investigation relates to EU-funded training for junior diplomats, the EPPO said. As well as Ms Mogherini, a senior College of Europe staff member and a senior official from the European Commission were detained, the prosecutor's office added.According to the EPPO, the three were formally told of the allegations against them: \"the accusations concern procurement fraud and corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy.\"The three accused were all subsequently released as they were not considered a flight risk and their homes were also searched.After a reported 10 hours of questioning, Ms Mogherini issued a statement saying she had \"clarified my position with the investigators\", adding that, \"in its long tradition, the College has always applied and will continue to apply the highest standards of integrity and fairness\".\"I have full confidence in the justice system, and I trust that the correctness of the College's actions will be ascertained. I will obviously continue to offer my full collaboration to the authorities,\" she said.Under Belgian law, a person can be arrested then released without being charged, while remaining a suspect.The EPPO said the investigation focused on a tender that the EEAS awarded to the College of Europe in 2021-2022. It added that there were \"strong suspicions\" of favouritism related to the tender for  a nine-month training course for junior diplomats.The EPPO, which investigates alleged crimes against the financial interests of the EU, did not name the three people questioned but said the immunity of several suspects had been lifted as part of the investigation.The College of Europe is an independent school attended by aspiring EU civil servants. It is closely associated with and partly funded by the EU. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterAdidas has fended off an appeal from shareholders who accused it of hiding misconduct by rapper-entrepreneur Kanye West - otherwise known as Ye - before their partnership broke down in 2022.A San Francisco court said the sportswear giant did not mislead investors, who claimed they had lost money after Adidas shares plunged when it cut ties with West.The Yeezy tie-up with West had been one of Adidas' most successful partnerships, but its collapse after a spate of anti-Semitic comments by the rapper cost the brand hundreds of millions of dollars.The BBC has contacted Adidas for comment but could not reach the firm leading the class action or West's team.West, who is not party to the lawsuit, was widely criticised after repeatedly making antisemitic remarks and promoting conspiracy theories.His Yeezy brand collaboration with Adidas was put under review after he showed a \"White Lives Matter\" T-shirt design at a fashion show in 2022. Shortly after, he posted anti-Semitic comments online, which prompted Adidas to pull his products from sale.West's behaviour also prompted several companies, including Gap and JP Morgan, to sever ties with the rapper.Court documents filed on Wednesday show that HLSA-ILA Funds, the firm representing investors, alleged that Adidas continued its partnership with West despite knowing about his controversial conduct for years.The filing claims Adidas \"internally grappled\" with West's behaviour but misled shareholders by failing to disclose the risk in its reports.The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ultimately sided with Adidas. The court said on Wednesday that a reasonable investor would know that a partnership with a celebrity like West could come with \"inherent risks relating to improper behaviour\".A district court had previously dismissed HLSA-ILA's case, and the firm later appealed.The collapse of Adidas' partnership with West caused the German firm's share price to tank in 2023.Yeezy, luxury trainers designed by West, had been a particularly lucrative line of products for Adidas, generating around €1.5bn (£870m; $1.17bn) in sales in 2021.The partnership breakdown left Adidas with more than €1bn worth of Yeezy shoes sitting in storage. In 2023, the brand announced that it would sell those products and donate some of the proceeds to charities who worked on combating hate.",

    "body": "Israel has announced it will open the key Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt in the coming days to allow Palestinians to leave the territory.Israeli military body Cogat said exits would be \"facilitated through co-ordination with Egypt, following security approval by Israel and under the supervision of the European Union mission\". It added that this would be \"similar to the mechanism that operated in January\", when the crossing opened during a previous ceasefire.An Israeli security official said it was an expression of Israel's support for the current ceasefire with Hamas, which began seven weeks ago.However, Egypt denied it was co-ordinating with Israel to reopen the Rafah crossing.The State Information Service cited an official Egyptian source as saying that \"if an agreement is reached to open the crossing, it will be in both directions, to enter and exit the Gaza Strip, in accordance with the plan of US President Donald Trump\".Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan states that \"opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism\" implemented under the January ceasefire deal.The crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. Before then, it was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the conflict and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. At least 16,500 severely ill or injured Palestinians in need of lifesaving medical treatment abroad are currently waiting to be evacuated from Gaza, according to the World Health Organization. It says only 235 patients, almost all of them children, have been evacuated via crossings with Israel since the ceasefire took effect.Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that Palestinian Authority (PA) forces would assist in operating the reopened Rafah crossing alongside the EU's Border Assistance Mission.It cited a European source as saying Palestinian representatives had also helped during the previous ceasefire but without wearing PA insignia due to \"Israeli sensitivity\" over their presence in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any role in the future governance of the territory for the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.Haaretz also reported that Netanyahu had so far blocked the reopening of the Rafah crossing because of the delayed return of the bodies of deceased hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza.Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian. In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.One of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli – Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is a Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.The Israeli prime minister's office said on Wednesday morning that forensic testing had shown that human remains handed over by Hamas in Gaza the previous day did not belong to either of the two men.On Wednesday afternoon, the military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, said it had recovered the body of a hostage in northern Gaza. The body will be transferred later to Israeli forces via the Red Cross, according to Hamas's military wing.The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "17 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorWhat does the latest round of diplomacy on Ukraine tell us about Russian President Vladimir Putin's mood and intentions?For starters, that he's not ready to sign a peace deal. At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "Cyclone catastrophe in Sri Lanka awakens volunteer spirit1 day agoIshara Danasekara,News Editor, BBC News SinhalaandKoh EweWatch: Sri Lankan communities under water after catastrophic floodingSri Lankan actor and musician GK Reginold rides a motorised fishing boat through Colombo's suburbs, hoping to bring food and water to those in desperate need.Some of the families, Mr Reginold says, have not received aid for days, isolated by the South Asian island nation's worst weather disaster in recent years.Cyclone Ditwah lashed the country last week, bringing catastrophic floods and landslides that killed more than 460 people, left hundreds missing and damaged some 30,000 homes.But the deluge has also inspired volunteerism among its people, as they face what their president has described as the \"most challenging natural disaster\" in its history.\"The main reason why I wanted to do this, is to at least help them to have one meal,\" Mr Reginold tells the BBC. \"And I was so happy that I was able to do that.\"BBC SinhalaVolunteers have been taking fishing boats out to rescue flood victims and deliver aidMore than one million people have been affected by the disaster and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency.Sri Lanka's military has deployed helicopters for rescue operations, while humanitarian aid is flowing in from foreign governments and non-governmental organisations.But it will be a long journey to recovery for Sri Lanka, which has seen its fair share of turmoil in recent years.Activists volunteer in community kitchenIn Colombo's Wijerama neighbourhood, activists who protested against former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 are now helping run a community kitchen that churns out food aid.The protests from three years ago were fuelled by a spiralling economic crisis that caused shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

    "body": "Watch: Australia's social media ban explained... in 60 secondsMeta has started removing Australian children under 16 years old from its Instagram, Facebook and Threads platforms, a week before an official teen social media ban begins.The tech giant announced last month it had begun notifying users aged between 13 to 15 years old that their accounts would start being shut down from 4 December.An estimated 150,000 Facebook users and 350,000 Instagram accounts are expected to be affected. Threads, similar to X, can only be accessed via an Instagram account.Australia's world-first social media ban starts on 10 December, with companies facing fines of up to A$49.5m (US$33m, £25m) if they fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to stop under-16s from having accounts.A spokesperson for Meta told the BBC on Thursday that \"compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process\".\"While Meta is committed to complying with the law, we believe a more effective, standardised, and privacy-preserving approach is needed,\" she said.The government should require app stores to verify the age of users when they download apps and ask for parental approval for under-16s, Meta said, as this would eliminate the need for teens to verify their age across different apps. Last month, Meta said users it had identified as under 16 would be able to download and save their posts, videos and messages before their accounts are deactivated.Teens who believe they have been wrongly categorised as under 16 can ask for a review and submit a \"video selfie\" to verify their age. They can also provide a driver's licence or a government-issued identification.Alongside Meta's three platforms, the other social media sites affected by the ban are YouTube, X, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick and Twitch.The government says the ban is aimed at protecting children from the harms of social media but critics say the move may isolate certain groups who depend on platforms for connection and push children to less-regulated corners of the internet.Communications Minister Anika Wells on Wednesday said she expected teething problems in the first few days and weeks of the ban but it was about protecting Gen Alpha - anyone under 15 years - and future generations. \"With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine,\" Wells said.She described youngsters as being connected to a \"dopamine drip\" from the moment they got a smartphone and social media accounts.Wells also said that she was closely watching lesser-known apps like Lemon8 - created by the makers behind TikTok - and Yope to see if children were migrating to those platforms after the ban.Earlier this week, Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant wrote to Lemon8 and Yope - both are video and photo-sharing apps - asking them to self-assess if they fell under the ban.Yope's chief executive and co-founder Bahram Ismailau said the start-up had not received any inquiries from Inman Grant yet but had already carried out a self-assessment and found it was not a social media platform.\"Because in practice Yope functions as a fully private messenger with no public content at all,\" he told the BBC.Yope works much like WhatsApp, Mr Ismailau said, where it's about \"seeing your people every day and sharing your life with them safely and privately\".Lemon8 has reportedly said it will exclude under-16s from its platform from next week, despite not being included in the ban.YouTube, which was originally exempt from the ban but then later included, labelled the law as \"rushed\" and claimed that banning children from having an account - which comes with parental controls - will make its video-sharing platform \"less safe\". Australia's social media ban, the first of its kind in the world, is being closely watched by global leaders.The government commissioned a study earlier this year which found that 96% of Australian children aged 10-15 used social media, and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content such as misogynistic and violent material as well as content promoting eating disorders and suicide.One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victim of cyberbullying.",

    "body": "Authorities in Hong Kong have ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh from buildings undergoing renovations by Saturday, as investigations continue into the Chinese territory's deadliest blaze in decades.It is now known that 159 people died as a result of the fire last Wednesday at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex - with 31 still missing.Investigators have found that a protective netting used around the complex, which had been undergoing extensive renovations, failed to meet flame retardant standards.Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho said new guidelines for testing materials used in scaffolding would be issued next week.Around 200 private residential and 10 public buildings are currently undergoing renovations in Hong Kong. The South China Morning Post, which is based in the territory, says about 300 buildings will be affected by the removal order.\"I assure the public that we will chase to the end the accountability of any contractors using substandard scaffolding mesh,\" Linn was quoted as saying.Samples had already been taken from mesh for testing, she added.At Wang Fuk Court, flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials said.Police have made at least 15 arrests for manslaughter as the investigation into the cause of the fire proceeds. On Wednesday, they said they had completed their searches of the interiors of all seven of the complex's towers and would now look for bodies in other parts of the buildings such as the remnants of the bamboo scaffolding.\"We have not finished our work,\" Police Commissioner Joe Chow said.\"As you can see... a lot of bamboo has fallen down. We still need to do some work... to see if any bodies were covered by the bamboo.\"He added that 140 of the 159 bodies found to date had been identified and were those of 49 males and 91 females, aged between one and 97, Radio Television Hong Kong reports.A married couple in their 70s, who lost their home in the blaze, returned to the charred site with their daughter on Wednesday, Reuters news agency reports.\"It all happened within just an hour or two,\" said the mother, whose name was given only as Leung.She continued: \"I stood there watching as one block after another went up in flames, my legs felt so weak I could hardly stand. When I saw it, I felt completely helpless. I still don't understand how the fire could spread so fiercely, devouring one building after another. It was terrifying. \"The bamboo scaffolding cracked and there was banging that sounded like exploding windows, the flames were completely out of control.\"Her daughter, Bonnie, added: \"We also hope the truth will come out - whether there were hidden hands behind this, corruption or any improper dealings.\"   ",

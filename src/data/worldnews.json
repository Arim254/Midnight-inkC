    "body": "5 hours agoChiamaka DikeBBC Africa, Makoko, LagosGift Ufuoma/BBCA mother of five, Anna Sobie's wooden home is one of many that has been demolished in a shanty town in a lagoon in Lagos, with critics describing it as a \"land-grab\" by the authorities to gentrify the prime waterfront spot in Nigeria's biggest city.Lagos State government officials deny the allegation, saying they are demolishing parts of Makoko - the country's biggest informal waterfront settlement - because it is expanding near high voltage power lines, posing a major health and safety risk.Sobie and her children now sleep on the narrow broken platform where their house stood until a few weeks ago on Lagos Lagoon. This is the biggest of 10 lagoons in a mega-city that is facing an acute housing crisis - and where life is becoming increasingly expensive, pushing more people to the margins of society. As Sobie spoke to the BBC, canoes - steered with paddles or long bamboo poles - moved through the narrow waterways, carrying mattresses and sacks of clothes belonging to the displaced people.Residents say the demolitions began two days before Christmas, when excavation teams accompanied by armed police moved into sections of the waterfront settlement facing the Atlantic Ocean.In a joint statement last month, 10 non-governmental organisations said that \"armed thugs, security personnel and demolition teams with bulldozers descended repeatedly on the community\" to tear down homes, and burn them.\"Homes were set on fire with little or no notice, in some cases while residents were still [inside],\" the NGOs added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCAnna Sobie's family are living on the the ruins of their houseWhen the BBC visited Makoko, smoke, from the rubble of torched homes or from fires that people had lit, burning damp wood to dry their clothes, was hanging in the air.Excavators were at work along the shoreline - houses built on wooden stilts over the lagoon were still being pulled down, their planks collapsing into the water below.  Corrugated metal sheets were falling from roofs and drifting between boats. Makoko was founded in the 19th Century by fishing communities who have lived in the settlement ever since, along with other low-income families and migrants who come to Lagos in search of better opportunities. Ownership of the lagoon is fiercely contested. The state government claims ownership of it under federal law, saying Makoko has been built without planning permission or occupancy rights. Older residents dispute this, saying the settlement predates modern Lagos, and they have what they call a customary right to it.Estimates of Makoko's population vary, from 80,000 to 200,000, but much of the settlement now lies in fragments.The NGOs said that more than 10,000 people have been displaced after the destruction of more than 3,000 homes, as well as schools, clinics and churches. The state government has not given any figures of the buildings demolished.Sobie's home was among those that have been destroyed. \"I was inside when it started,\" she says. \"The noise was very loud. When we came out, we saw the excavator.\"She says there was little time to move her family's belongings. Her son Solomon's school in Makoko was demolished the same day. Sobie's family moved briefly into a building nearby. That, too, was later pulled down. \"We're sleeping in an open space under the rain, and they're currently setting properties ablaze,\" Sobie says, adding:  \"We don't have another place.\" Like many other children, Solomon no longer goes to school. He now helps his mother gather firewood from collapsed houses, pulling loose planks from the debris to sell.Even as the excavators work, canoe-borne business activities continue, with traders peddling their way between the remaining homes to sell fish and goods. But many other traders can no longer do business, as they lost their goods when their homes were demolished or torched.With the lagoon central to their lives, they have protested against the move to force them out of Makoko. Gift Ufuoma/BBCThe state government says it will give financial compensation to families whose homes have been destroyedMore than 1,000 angry residents marched last week to the state legislature, the House of Assembly, demanding an audience with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, whose offices are nearby.But police responded by firing tear gas, with protesters saying that at least one person was injured in the ensuing chaos.Community leaders and residents say that tear gas was also fired during the demolitions a few weeks ago, causing the death of five people, including children. \"Children were weeping, some died, some were unconscious, and were taken to the hospital as a result of the tear gas,\" Sobie tells the BBC.The Lagos State government says it is unaware of their personnel using tear gas or of deaths linked to the demolitions. Speaking to the BBC, the state's commissioner for information, Gbenga Omotoso, says that any such claims would be investigated.\"We would determine the actual cause of death,\" he says. \"Our personnel will not knowingly kill anybody.\"The state government has defended the demolitions, saying they are targeting homes built beneath high voltage power lines.\"No responsible government anywhere in the world can allow people to live directly under high-tension cables or obstruct vital waterways,\" the governor's special adviser on urban development, Olajide Abiodun Babatunde, said in a statement. Governor Sanwo-Olu said that affected families would be provided with financial grants and other assistance, and it was wrong to accuse him of \"destroying\" Makoko. He raised concern that shanties were \"sprawling\" at an \"incredible speed\", getting closer to the Third Mainland Bridge, the longest and busiest of three bridges connecting the mainland to the islands - the commercial heart of the city and its wealthier neighbourhoods.For the governor this spells danger.\"So, what we have done is that we just pushed them back,\" he added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCSome residents suspect their homes have been demolished to pave the way for an upmarket development Lagos-based real estate developer Peacemaker Afolabi tells the BBC that demand for land in the city is huge.\"Everywhere in Lagos is prime land,\" he says. \"And waterfront is always prime.\" Some residents suspect that the demolitions are aimed at clearing the area for private developments, including luxury homes.This has been repeatedly denied by the state government, but suspicion remains.\"This is not the slow, decades-long gentrification often seen in Western cities. It's a rapid, almost violent reshaping that is already forcing millions of residents to the margins,\" he writes. \"In the next few years, Lagos may look more polished and globally appealing. But for many of its people, it will also become profoundly unliveable.\"In their joint statement, the NGOs said that demolitions in Makoko, and other settlements last year, were part of a \"sinister agenda to grab land\". \"These actions against thousands of peaceful, hardworking residents represent a deliberate pattern of state-enabled violence against the urban poor, carried out to clear valuable land for elite interests and private mega-developments,\" the NGOs said. \"The housing deficit has thus grown from approximately 2.95 million units in 2016 to 3.4 million in 2025, a 15 per cent increase,\" Nigeria's Punch newspaper quoted the report as saying.Rapid population growth, rising rents and limited access to formal housing have pushed many low-income residents into informal settlements, particularly along waterfronts and transport corridors.The authorities have demolished homes in Makoko in the past - most recently in 2017, when residents obtained a court order to prevent forced evictions without adequate notice, compensation and resettlement.Megan Chapman, co-director of the Justice and Empowerment Initiatives campaign group, says the government has failed to provide residents affected by the latest demolitions with alternative accommodation. \"They have to identify everyone who will be affected and make arrangements before homes are lost,\" she tells the BBC\"When people are removed like this, it affects livelihoods, family structures and how communities function over time.\"When the BBC was in Makoko, boys were sitting along the lagoon, repairing their broken fishing nets. Children moved between piles of debris, collecting firewood from collapsed structures. A tractor pulled away from what was once a house. Only a small number of buildings remained standing, including the homes of traditional leaders.Elizabeth Kakisiwe says she sleeps nearby.Each evening, she lays wooden boards on damp ground for her children and packs them away again in the morning.\"We were at the market when it started,\" she says. \"When I came back, my house was gone.\"She says there was no clear warning and no time to remove belongings. Clothes, cooking utensils and mattresses were lost. When rain fell days later, they were drenched.\"At night, we sit in the cold,\" she says. \"If the children feel sick, we give them paracetamol.\"Cooking has become difficult, she says, because rain has made the ground wet and rats move through the debris. \"Yesterday, we only drank garri,\" Kakisiwe says, referring to a popular cassava-based meal that is often made as a drink. \"There is nothing to cook.\"Expressing a similar view, Sobie says: \"The suffering is much. A lot of people have been dying. We just don't know what to say. It's only God that can help us.\"Additional reporting by Gift UfuomaMore BBC stories about housing in Lagos:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "'Superhuman' teen swims hours to save family stranded off Australian coast16 hours agoKerena CobbinaGetty ImagesThe family were stranded 4km off the coast in Geographe BayA 13-year-old boy has been praised for his determination after he swam through rough waters in fading light to save his mother and two siblings who had been swept out to sea off Australia's coast.The family had been paddleboarding and kayaking at Geographe Bay in the south of Western Australia, on Friday when strong winds pushed their inflatables off course, police said.The teenager began to paddle back to shore to raise the alarm but his kayak took on water - so he swam the remaining 4km (2 nautical miles).\"The bravery, strength and courage shown by this family were extraordinary, especially the young fella who swam 4km to raise the alarm,\" Naturaliste Volunteer Marine Rescue Group said.The organisation's commander Paul Bresland described the efforts of the teenager as \"superhuman\".\"He swam in, he reckons, the first two hours with a life jacket on,\" he told ABC News. \"The brave fella thought he's not going to make it with a life jacket on, so he ditched it, and he swam the next two hours without a life jacket.\"The boy was able to raise the alarm by 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Friday evening, sparking a huge search for the missing relatives from Quindalup beach, near Busselton, WA Police said in a statement on Monday.The boy's 47-year-old mother, her other son, 12, and daughter, eight, were located at around 20:30 by a rescue helicopter clinging to a paddleboard about 14km offshore. \"A volunteer marine rescue vessel was directed to their location and all three were successfully rescued and returned to shore,\" the force said.Insp James Bradley said the incident was an important reminder of how rapidly ocean conditions can change. \"Thankfully, all three people were wearing life jackets, which contributed to their survival,\" he told local media.\"The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough - his determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.\"The family were assessed by paramedics before being taken to a nearby hospital, police said.The family were later discharged and visited the marine rescue crew to say thank you, the ABC reported.",

    "body": "16 hours agoDoug FaulknerReutersChina has reacted angrily to an unlikely winner at the Grammys - the Dalai Lama - saying it opposes art awards being used for \"anti-China political manipulation\".The Buddhist spiritual leader was recognised in the audiobook category for Meditations: The Reflections of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.The Dalai Lama said he accepted the award with \"gratitude and humility\".The 90-year-old has lived in exile from his Tibetan homeland since 1959 and is condemned as a rebel and separatist by Beijing.China's foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a news conference: \"We firmly oppose relevant parties using art awards as a tool for anti-China political manipulation, and this position is consistent and clear.\"The spiritual leader, who lives in Dharamshala in India, left China in fear of his life after Chinese troops crushed an uprising. He has campaigned for more autonomy for Tibet, but Beijing considers it an integral part of China.In a message on social media the Dalai Lama, who is also a Nobel peace laureate, said: \"I receive this recognition with gratitude and humility.\"I don't see it as something personal, but as a recognition of our shared universal responsibility.\"The award was collected on his behalf by musician Rufus Wainwright, who was among the artists to feature on the audiobook.Getty ImagesRufus Wainwright collected the award on behalf of the Tibetan spiritual leaderLast year the Dalai Lama confirmed plans to name a successor, which has caused further friction with China. According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after death - a process deeply rooted in spiritual customs, not political authority.He has previously said his reincarnation will take place in the \"free world\", meaning outside of atheist and communist China but Beijing swiftly rejected his authority to determine a successor.Chinese officials insist that any succession must follow Chinese laws, religious rituals and historical conventions - and ultimately be approved by the government in Beijing.The announcement has reignited fears among Tibetans in exile that China will attempt to name a successor to tighten control over Tibet, the region it occupied in 1950 and has ruled ever since.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPeter HoskinsBloomberg via Getty ImagesHidden handles are widespread in China's new energy vehicle marketChina has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.It comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.Under the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media. The new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle. Inside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.  Cars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.Hidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.They feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.Although the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.Tesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.In November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.The NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.In four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

    "body": "60 minutes agoNardine SaadGetty ImagesA federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end  deportation protections for more than 350,000 Haitian immigrants, who are allowed to live and work in the US legally under Temporary Protected Status (TPS).A day before the TPS was set to lapse, US judge Ana Reyes said the Department of Homeland Security boss doesn't have the facts or law on her side.\"Plaintiffs charge that Secretary [Kristi] Noem preordained her termination decision and did so because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants. This seems substantially likely,\" Reyes wrote.The administration has argued that TPS schemes attract illegal immigration and have long been abused and extended by Democrats.TPS prevents US officials from deporting immigrants to countries deemed unsafe whether from natural disasters, armed conflicts or other crises.In a scathing 83-page ruling, Reyes denied the Trump administration's motion to have the lawsuit dismissed, granting the plaintiffs' request for the deportation protection to remain while the case makes its way through the courts. The plaintiffs in the case are five Haitian TPS holders.\"They are not, it emerges, 'killers, leeches, or entitlement junkies,'\" Reyes wrote, quoting missives by Noem. Haiti was designated as eligible for TPS after the Caribbean nation suffered a devastating earthquake in 2010. The status has been extended repeatedly, most recently in 2021 under the Biden administration. The Trump administration has argued that TPS for Haitians has transformed into permanent residency and has become incongruous with Congress' original intention in creating the program. The Trump administration has pushed for the dismantling of most TPS programmes, raising the possibility of deportation for hundreds of thousands of migrants in the US from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela, among others.Meanwhile, the administration has also moved to end deportation protections for around 2,500, Somalis. Starting 17 March, they will lose their work authorisations and legal status, making them eligible for deportation.",

The resort's chief executive Tsuneo Kubo expressed his \"deepest condolences to the bereaved family\" and said safety measures would be strengthened.He said in a statement that an unfastened buckle on the woman's backpack had become hooked to the chair while the bag's chest strap was still fastened, causing her to be dragged along with it after trying to disembark.The lift was stopped by an attendant who pressed the emergency button, after which first aid was administered and the woman was transported to hospital by ambulance, Kubo added.The accident took place at the top of the two-person Tsuga No.2 Pair Lift. The woman had been riding the lift with another person, police told local media.The lift operator said it was co-operating with police and other authorities as the cause of the accident was investigated and safety procedures reviewed.\"We will take concrete measures to prevent recurrence,\" Kubo said. \"We take this situation very seriously and will strive to operate the ski resort in a safe manner so that our customers can use it with peace of mind.\"Police are questioning resort staff and inspecting the lift equipment as part of their inquiry, according to local media.Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that one of its citizens had died in Japan and said it was providing consular assistance to the family.\"We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time. Owing to our privacy obligations we are unable to provide further comment,\" a spokesperson said.Tsugaike Mountain Resort in Hakuba Valley is one of Nagano's largest ski areas, popular with both domestic and international visitors.",

    "body": "17 hours agoTom BennettGetty ImagesThe South African comedian was hosting the music awardsUS President Donald Trump has threatened to sue comedian Trevor Noah after he joked about Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at the Grammy Awards.Hosting the event, Noah said: \"Song of the Year - that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein's island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton.\"Trump is known to have been an associate of Epstein for years, but says he had no knowledge of his crimes and that they fell out in about 2004. There are no suggestions he ever visited Epstein's private island and he has not been accused of any crime by Epstein's victims.  The US justice department has said allegations about him are unfounded and false.Trump responded to Noah's joke by saying he would be \"sending my lawyers to sue\". Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!!\"I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.\"Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.\"He added: \"Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!\"Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor.He had purchased his private island in 1998. Multiple survivors have alleged that they were trafficked there and abused. Trump has engaged in legal action with multiple media organisations in recent years, including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.In December, he filed a multi-billion dollar lawsuit in a Florida court accusing the BBC of defamation and of violating a trade practices law over the editing of a Panorama programme.Noah is a South African-born comedian who hosted The Daily Show on Comedy Central in the US for seven years.

    "body": "Ukraine hails 'real results' after Musk restricts Russian Starlink use14 hours agoLaura GozziReutersElon Musk's efforts to stop Russia from using Starlink satellites for drone attacks have \"delivered real results\", a Ukrainian official said.Praising the SpaceX founder as \"a true champion of freedom and a true friend of the Ukrainian people\", defence minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Musk had swiftly responded when he was told Russian drones with Starlink connectivity were operating in the country.\"Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorised use of Starlink by Russia have worked,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Let us know if more needs to be done.\"The Russian drones are difficult to shoot down, Fedorov said, as they fly at low altitudes, cannot be countered with electronic warfare, and are controlled by operators in real time from a distance.The Institute for the Study of War warned in mid-January that since Russia had begun equipping the cheap kamikaze Molniya-2 drones with Starlink, their battlefield efficiency had increased \"dramatically\".While neither Fedorov nor Musk elaborated on what the response had been, the defence ministry's official website ArmiyaInform reported that SpaceX had introduced a speed limit of 75kph on Starlink terminals moving over Ukraine.\"Russian drones move much more quickly, so the enemy operators will not be able to control them in real time,\" the website said.Telegram/Serhiy BeskrestnovEarlier in January Serhiy Beskrestnov, an adviser to Mykhailo Fedorov, said a Starlink terminal had been found on a BM-35 kamikaze droneOn Monday Fedorov said the Ukrainian government was also preparing to implement a white list of approved Starlink satellite terminals which could operate in Ukraine. All unregistered terminals will be disconnected, Fedorov said.\"We are implementing this in cooperation with SpaceX,\" Fedorov stated, adding that instructions on registering the terminals would be forthcoming.Russian war bloggers warned the implications could go beyond drones, as the Russian military uses Starlink to provide the front line with internet.Fedorov - then deputy prime minister - asked for Musk's help soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. By the end of the day Musk said Starlink had been enabled in Ukraine and promised more satellite dishes.But shortly after supplying Ukraine with Starlink, Musk's relationship with Kyiv became turbulent. Later in 2022 he denied the Ukrainian military access to Starlink in Crimea, where Russia has been stationing military equipment since illegally annexing in 2014.At the time, Musk justified the decision by saying that Ukraine would have used Starlink access to \"sink most of the Russian fleet\", making SpaceX \"complicit in a major act of war\".Musk has since repeatedly criticised Western countries for providing Ukraine with funding and weaponry. \"It is insane to keep sending so much money to Ukraine with no accountability and no end game,\" he said.However, he has also stated that \"no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals.\"\"My Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off,\" Musk said in March.Despite these tensions, Fedorov last week again praised Musk's timely decision to provide his country with access at the start of the full-scale invasion, saying Starlink had been \"critically important for the stability of our state\".The 35-year-old former digital transformation minister was appointed to head the ministry of defence by President Volodymyr Zelensky last month.Fedorov favours a data-driven strategy and advanced cyber-warfare. He has also vowed to work closely with Silicon Valley companies, arguing that integrating partners would make Ukraine's defence system stronger.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring",

    "body": "11 hours agoThomas Naadi,BBC Africa, AccraandJean OtalorIraEfremova via Getty imagesMore than 1,000 members of the African diaspora have obtained Ghanaian citizenship in recent yearsGhana has paused citizenship applications for members of the African diaspora in order to make the system more accessible and user friendly. Since 2016, those who can prove their ancestors came from Africa have been able to get Ghanaian nationality. It was primarily aimed at the descendants of those who were victims of the transatlantic slave trade.More than 1,000 people - including African American singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder - have obtained Ghanaian citizenship in recent years.However, some applicants have complained about the number of stages involved, as well as the high cost.Dr Erieka Bennet, ambassador for the Diaspora African Forum, which helps people relocate to Ghana, told the BBC that many applicants struggled with the requirement to submit DNA evidence within a week of the application, saying the timeframe was \"impossible\" for most and that some also questioned the reliability of DNA testing.Another concern was cost. The application fee stands at $136 (£100), while shortlisted candidates are required to pay a further $2,280 (£1,700).They are then vetted and attend a one-day citizenship orientation before finally receiving their nationality at a ceremony overseen by President John Mahama.Bennet expressed confidence that the issues would be resolved and that the application process would resume. The government has said updated timelines and guidelines will be issued \"in due course\", without giving a timeframe.Uncertainty around the suspension has caused anxiety for some potential applicants planning their relocation or investments.Ghana's outreach to Africans worldwide is rooted in its post-independence Pan-African vision championed by the country's first President, Kwame Nkrumah.It was relaunched in 2019 as the Year of Return to revive global interest in reconnecting with the country.Today, members of the diaspora invest in sectors including real estate, agriculture, tech and small businesses, often seeking Ghanaian citizenship so they can own property, vote and access public services.Countries such as Benin and Sierra Leone also offer citizenship to people of African descent based on verified ancestral ties.More about Ghana from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "12 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor, OsloWatch: BBC reports from Oslo court ahead of Crown Princess's son's rape trialThe son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit has been arrested by police on suspicion of assault, before he goes on trial in Oslo on Tuesday on 38 charges, including the rape of four women.Marius Borg Høiby, 29, was remanded in custody for four weeks. Police said the latest allegations against him involved wielding a knife and violating a restraining order, and there was a risk of reoffending.His arrest on Sunday is the fourth time he has been detained by police since August 2024, when he was accused of assaulting a woman he had been having a relationship with.He has denied the most serious charges against him but admitted some of the more minor ones.It is the latest scandal to beset the royal family.AFPMarius Borg Høiby has now been arrested four times in 18 months (file picture)Norwegians are also coming to terms with revelations that his mother corresponded for three years with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein between 2011 and 2014.Crown Princess Mette-Marit admitted \"poor judgement\" as her extensive contacts with Epstein became clear. She expressed her \"deep sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the abuses committed by Jeffrey Epstein\" and said her contact with him was \"simply embarrassing\".It has emerged she stayed at his Florida home for four nights, while he was not there, and asked Epstein if it was \"inappropriate\" for a mother to suggest to a 15-year-old son wallpaper showing two naked women carrying a surfboard.Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said he agreed with her admission of \"poor judgement\", and although he did not go further, his implicit criticism of her actions is highly unusual.Questions are now being asked in Norway about her failure to realise the toxic nature of maintaining contact with Epstein, and about the role of her advisers when she was corresponding with him via an official royal email account.\"It seems that nobody has been thinking. Where are the counsellors, where's the royal court and where's the foreign office?\" says Ole-Jørgen Schulsrud-Hansen, a historian and royal correspondent for Norway's TV2.He believes the monarch has managed to distance itself from the imminent court case, with the argument that the princess's son is a private citizen, but that is not the case for Mette-Marit: \"She's never a private citizen, she's always the crown princess and what she's doing in a private capacity or official capacity it will always redirect back to Norway - or ricochet.\"Mette-Marit is the future queen of Norway, and she has a prominent role in society as patron of several organisations including the Red Cross.She is also suffering from pulmonary fibrosis and her doctors are preparing to put her on a list for a lung transplant.When Mette-Marit married into the family as a commoner, her son was already four years old.Per Ole Hagen/Getty ImagesCrown Princess Mette-Marit, shown at an event for Norway's Constitution Day last year, is the country's future queenAlthough Marius Borg Høiby is not a member of the royal family, he is still Crown Prince Haakon's stepson.The charges against him range from rape and abuse to violating a restraining order, transporting 3.5kg of marijuana and speeding.When he was first arrested in 2024 he spoke of having several mental disorders and struggling with substance abuse. Since then he has spent only a week in custody, so the police request to remand him for much of the start of the trial is a change of stance on their part.The Oslo District Court said in a statement quoted by Reuters news agency that it had agreed to the police request in order to prevent repeated offences.The royal household has sought to distance itself from the trial, and in a statement last week, Crown Prince Haakon reached out to the women caught up in the case and their families, saying it was \"a difficult time for many of you, and we sympathise\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoMadina MaishanuBBC Africa, AbujaBBCThe chairs strewn across the floor of one of the churches raided last month hints at the panic the attack caused Dozens of worshippers kidnapped by gunmen in Nigeria's northern Kaduna state have returned home weeks after their abduction, police have confirmed.They were among 177 people seized last month from three churches in the remote village of Kurmin Wali.The 80 people escaped on the day they were taken but hid in neighbouring villages for a fortnight \"due to fear of being captured again\", state police spokesman Mansur Hassan told the BBC.The authorities say efforts are ongoing to secure the release of the remaining 86 people still being held. The attack was part of a wave of kidnappings for ransom affecting many parts of Nigeria, but no group has said it was behind the abductions.The raid was initially denied by police, who only confirmed the kidnappings on 21 January after local residents had reported to the BBC that 177 worshippers were abducted, with 11 escaping shortly afterwards.The official response drew criticism from Amnesty International, which accused Nigerian authorities of \"desperate denial\".The rights group urged officials to \"take immediate and concrete measures to prevent rampant abductions that are gradually becoming the norm in Nigeria.\"In November, more than 300 students and teachers were taken from a Catholic school in Niger state, which neighbours Kaduna, before being released in two groups.Nigeria faces multiple, overlapping security challenges beyond kidnappings, including an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and frequent clashes between herders and farmers in central regions over land and water.Security experts say efforts to tackle these crises are hampered by corruption, poor intelligence sharing, and underfunded local police forces.The security situation has drawn international attention. In December, the US conducted airstrikes in north-western Nigeria on Christmas Day, targeting two camps run by an Islamist militant group.Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is home to more than 250 ethnic groups and is roughly divided between a predominantly Muslim north and a largely Christian south, with significant mixing in central regions. The government maintains that people of all faiths have been victims of the widespread violence.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "US and India reach trade deal, Trump says after Modi call8 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesAccording to Trump, India has agreed to purchase over $500bn worth of US goods. US President Donald Trump announced that he agreed to a trade deal with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where the US will lower tariffs on goods from India to 18% from 25%.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said India will reduce trade barriers to zero and will also stop buying Russian oil. An additional 25% tariff penalty imposed for Delhi's refusal to stop buying oil from Russia will be dropped. The announcement comes less than a week after India and the European Union announced a landmark trade deal that capped nearly two decades of on-off talks. Modi said on X that he is \"delighted\" that an agreement with the US has been reached. In the post, Trump said that a morning phone call with Modi included discussions of trade and the Russia-Ukraine war. \"He agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and to buy much more oil from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela,\" Trump wrote.Trump added that, at Modi's request, he immediately \"agreed to a trade deal\" that would see tariffs lowered and India's tariffs and non-tariff barriers reduced to zero. Additionally, Trump said Modi committed to buying more than $500bn (£366bn) worth of American goods including energy, technology, agriculture and coal products.The trade relationship between the US and India has been strained since the US imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India - the highest for a country in Asia - in August, including a 25% penalty linked to India's purchase of Russian oil.A White House official confirmed to the BBC that the Russian oil-linked tariffs will be dropped as part of the agreement and other tariffs lowered to put the rate at 18%.\"Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement,\" Modi said on X.\"When two large economies and the world's largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation,\" he added.Indian exports to the US plummeted sharply as Trump's tariffs took effect.Officials in Delhi have been seeking partnerships with other countries also grappling with Trump's tariffs.Last week, India and the European Union announced a free trade agreement that is set to lower taxes on nearly all goods between India and the bloc of 27 European states, as both sides seek to deepen ties in the face of increasing tensions with the US. The agreement, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called \"the mother of all deals\", is poised to double EU exports to India by 2032, according to the EU.Terry Haines, founder of Pangaea Policy, an analysis and forecasting firm, called the Washington-Delhi deal \"an answer to those thinking the EU is flanking or gaining speed on the US on trade.\"He said he expected US markets to \"cheer\" the agreement. We Pay the Tariffs, a coalition of 800 US small businesses, criticised the announcement, noting that before Trump's tariffs policies were implemented, American importers paid an average of 2.5% on goods from India. \"This 'deal' locks in a rate six times higher than what we were paying a year ago,\" the organisation's director, Dan Anthony, said. \"That's not relief, it's a permanent tax hike that will be in place for a long time.\" US stocks inched higher after Trump announced the trade deal with Delhi on Truth Social.

    "body": "Hope and uncertainty as India and US strike long-delayed trade deal1 hour agoNikhil InamdarAFP via Getty ImagesIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (left) last met US President Donald Trump in February at the White House, but the two have spoken on the phone several times since thenUS President Donald Trump's decision to lower reciprocal tariffs on India from 50% to 18% has been met with a sense of relief in Asia's third-largest economy, even as precise details on the agreement remain sketchy.India paid the highest tariffs in the world after Trump raised import duties on Indian goods from 25% to 50% in August last year, saying Delhi's purchase of discounted Russian oil was helping fund Moscow's war effort in Ukraine.After his call with India's prime minister on Monday, Trump claimed Narendra Modi had \"agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and buy much more from the United States, and potentially Venezuela\".India has not commented on these exact claims, but Modi thanked Trump \"on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement\", saying he hoped to take the partnership with the US to \"unprecedented heights\".The patch-up comes after Trump's trade war soured carefully cultivated relations between Washington and Delhi, with exports from India to the US falling sharply across key job-creating sectors such as textiles, seafood and jewellery.Trump's tariffs also forced a notoriously protectionist government in Delhi to expedite a flurry of other trade agreements and diversify its export markets.Last week, India and the EU announced \"the mother of all trade deals\", eliminating tariff lines on 80-90% of goods. It was Delhi's ninth free trade agreement in four years, as the deal with Washington showed no signs of progress.The long-delayed announcement by Trump was expectedly, widely welcomed by Indian industry.\"While the devil is in the details, it removes a hanging sword over the rupee, equity and rates market. Let us hope that it is a win-win deal for both the countries,\" said Nilesh Shah, a fund manager.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesExports from India to the US have sharply fallen across sectors such as seafood and textilesTariff-related uncertainty was one of the many reasons for India's rising trade gap, falling rupee and a flight of foreign money from the country last year. The 18% tariff now brings the rate in line with India's peers in Asia such as Vietnam, Thailand and Bangladesh who pay duties between 19% and 40% on US exports.\"This greatly boosts India's appeal as an alternative to China for the reconfiguration of supply chains. Indeed, India still offers many other advantages that other manufacturing hubs can't, including low labour costs, political stability and a large domestic market for MNCs to sell to as a hedge against future tariffs,\" Shilan Shah of Capital Economics said in a note.India's textile exporters also cheered the announcement, with the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry saying the deal will allow them to \"compete effectively in the US market, the single-largest market for India's textile and apparel exports\".'How will I pay workers?': Indian factories hit hard by Trump's 50% tariffsBut trade experts warn that there's much that's still in the realm of speculation, and Delhi should not rush to celebrate just yet.\"The Truth Social post [by Trump] leaves major questions unanswered - what products are covered, what the timelines are, and whether India has really agreed to zero tariffs and zero non-tariff barriers, especially in sensitive areas like agriculture and regulated imports,\" said Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based Global Trade and Research Initiative (GTRI) think-tank.GTRI also cautioned against Trump's claims that Modi had committed to \"Buy American\" and purchase more than $500bn worth of energy, technology, agricultural and other goods, given that India's current annual imports from the US are under $50bn.\"Until there is a joint statement, negotiated text, and clarity on enforceability, this should be treated as a political signal - not a concluded trade deal. Caution, not celebration, is warranted,\" said Srivastava.Getty Images(From left) In September, Putin, Modi and Xi displayed clear bonhomie when they met in China for a summitBut the breakthrough in talks after a long impasse is being seen as directionally positive.\"Both governments have made clear that this is only the beginning, with additional phases and negotiations anticipated in the months ahead,\" The US-India Strategic Partnership Forum said in a statement, calling it an important first step.From a geopolitical lens too, the announcement holds significance, say analysts.Over the past year, Beijing, Delhi and Moscow had deepened ties after Trump's sweeping tariffs came into effect.In September, the leaders of India, China and Russia displayed rare solidarity at the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation Summit in Tianjin, smiling and posing for photographs in what was seen as clear signalling of a new bonhomie to the US administration.And in December, Modi and Putin met again, to further their \"no limits partnership\".India's foreign policy has always had to do a juggle between these important relationships. But some reckon that the thawing of the relationship with Trump could now mean that Delhi leans back more quickly towards the US.\"Many in India would like to remain strategically unaligned, but if this rapprochement proves durable, India would likely gravitate back to the US bloc,\" said Shah.",

    "body": "12 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, JerusalemandHafsa KhalilAFPAmbulances waiting at the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on Monday morningSick and wounded Palestinians from Gaza have arrived in Egypt after the key Rafah border crossing reopened for the movement of people.The crossing has largely been closed since May 2024, when the Gazan side was captured by Israeli forces.The reopening was supposed to happen during the first phase of US President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, which began in October. But Israel blocked it until the return of the body of the last Israeli hostage in Gaza, which happened last week.It will come as a relief to many Palestinians who see it as a lifeline to the world, although there is frustration that only small numbers of people and no goods will be allowed through.Around 20,000 sick and wounded Palestinians are waiting to leave Gaza for treatment, according to local hospitals and the World Health Organization (WHO).Israeli reports say only 50 patients - accompanied by one or two relatives - will be allowed to exit each day, and that 50 people who left Gaza during the war will be allowed to return.It is understood that there was disagreement over whether carers should be allowed to return from Egypt with former patients as part of that quota, which caused some delays.The crossing will be run by supervisors from the European Union and local Palestinian staff, while Israel will carry out stringent security checks remotely.On Monday morning, an Israeli security official said the Rafah crossing had \"now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit\" following the arrival of teams from the European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM).Al Qahera News TV, which is close to Egyptian intelligence, meanwhile said the crossing had \"received the first batch of Palestinians returning from Egypt to the Gaza Strip\".After sunset, Al Qahera broadcast footage appearing to show ambulances transferring patients across the border into Egypt.\"Three ambulances have arrived so far carrying a number of the sick and injured, who were immediately screened upon arrival to determine to which hospital they will be transferred,\" an Egyptian health official at the border told AFP news agency.A Palestinian mother, Sabrine al-Da'ma, told the BBC she was hoping to travel abroad with her 16-year-old daughter, Rawa, who suffers from kidney disease. She plans to donate Rawa one of her kidneys.\"She used to be treated through monitoring, ultrasound imaging and tests to check the condition of her kidneys. Since the war started, because of food shortages, hunger, and the food she was forced to eat, she began dialysis,\" Da'ma said.\"We hope they will speed up our referral so that we can travel quickly, because she is getting exhausted. I am also 45 years old, and they may tell me that as I get older, I won't be able to donate anymore. That's why we're rushing.\"Maha Ali, 26, told the BBC that she was hoping to leave Gaza to study a master's degree in Algeria, but that she had previously been told by Israeli authorities that they did not consider students to be \"humanitarian cases\".\"By now, I was supposed to have defended my master's thesis and started my PhD, but two years of my life have been lost. I am now in Gaza and I have not been able to do anything I had planned,\" she said.The head of the Palestinian technocratic committee due to take over day-to-day running of Gaza, Ali Shaath, said the reopening of the crossing marked \"the beginning of a long process that will reconnect what has been severed and open a genuine window of hope for our people in the Gaza Strip\".The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: \"The opening of the Rafah crossing marks a concrete and positive step in the peace plan.\"UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also welcomed the move, but stressed that \"much more still needs to be done\". \"Aid must flow in, restrictions on essential supplies must ease, and aid workers must be allowed to operate,\" she added.Sabrine al-Da'ma is hoping her 16-year-old daughter, Rawa, will be evacuated for treatment abroadOn Sunday, Israeli authorities said a trial opening of the crossing was carried out and completed.One Palestinian official familiar with the arrangements for the trial told the BBC that around 30 Palestinian staff members had arrived at the Egyptian side of the crossing, ahead of the initial operational phase.The WHO will oversee the transfer of patients from territory under Hamas control, transporting them by bus to the crossing over the \"Yellow Line\" and into territory controlled by the Israeli military.About 150 hospitals and 300 ambulances in Egypt are ready to receive the evacuated patients, according to Al Qahera News.Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan says the reopening of the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under a previous ceasefire deal in January last year.Before being seized by Israel in 2024, the crossing was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the war and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. Now, aid that enters from Egypt is routed via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing point.In December, the Israeli government said the Rafah crossing would open to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza. But Egypt said the crossing would only be opened if movement was allowed in both directions.More than 30,000 Gazans have registered with the Palestinian embassy in Cairo to be allowed to return to Gaza.The crossing's opening was delayed due to the Israeli government making it conditional on Hamas handing over the body of the last dead Israeli hostage in Gaza.Last week, the Israeli military said its troops had retrieved the remains of police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili at a cemetery in northern Gaza.He was one of the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies during their attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed around 1,200 people.Israel's military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, has killed more than 71,800 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Both sides have accused each other of repeated violations since the ceasefire began 16 weeks ago. The health ministry has said 526 people have been killed by Israeli fire, while the Israeli military has said four of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks.",

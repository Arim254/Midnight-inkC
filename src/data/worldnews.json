    "body": "The US National Park Service (NPS) is removing Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth from its list of fee-free entrance days.The move is part of President Donald Trump's \"modernisation\" of the park service, which, beginning in 2026, also includes changing the parks' cost structure to favour American citizens over foreign visitors, following a July executive order from Trump.In addition to removing the two holidays that celebrate civil rights leader MLK Jr and the end of slavery in the US, the agency is adding Flag Day, which is also Trump's birthday, as a \"patriotic\" fee-free day. People who are not US citizens will still have to pay fees on the fee-free dates, the NPS said.For the 2026 calendar year, US residents will be granted free access to national parks on President's Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day/President Trump's birthday, Independence Day weekend, 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt's birthday and Veteran's Day.Previously, Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth were both deemed fee-free entry days by the Biden administration.Under the Trump administration's new rules, US residents will continue to pay $80 (£60) for an annual park service pass. The Department of the Interior, which oversees the park service, announced last month that the annual pass will cost non-residents $250, and those without the pass will pay $100 per person, in addition to the standard entrance fee, at 11 of the most visited parks. \"President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. \"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" Burgum's statement continued. In May, the department estimated in its budget proposal for 2026 fiscal year that surcharges for foreign visitors would rake in more than $90 million per year.  This isn't the first time the Trump administration has targeted Juneteenth and MLK Jr Day. On his first day in office this year, Trump issued an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes from federal agencies, which led multiple agencies to bar celebrations of holidays seen as DEI-related, including MLK Jr Day and Juneteenth. However, the two dates remain national holidays. In June, the Trump administration held a military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happened to fall on both Flag Day and Trump's birthday. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. ",

    "body": "A drone attack on the town of Kalogi, in Sudan's South Kordofan region, is said to have hit a kindergarten and killed at least 50 people, including 33 children. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group battling the army in Sudan's civil war, was accused of Thursday's attack by a medical organisation, the Sudan Doctors' Network, and the army.There was no immediate comment from the RSF. The RSF in turn accused the army of hitting a market on Friday in a drone attack in the Darfur region, on a fuel depot at the Adre border crossing with Chad.Sudan has been ravaged by war since April 2023 when a power struggle broke out between the RSF and the army, who were formerly allies .The reports could not be verified independently.   According to the army-aligned foreign ministry, the kindergarten was struck twice with missiles from drones.Civilians and medics who rushed to the school were also attacked, it added.Responding to reports of the attack in Kalogi, a spokesman for the UN children's agency Unicef said: \"Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children's rights.\"\"Children should never pay the price of conflict,\" Sheldon Yett added.The agency, he said, urged \"all parties to stop these attacks immediately and allow safe, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to reach those in desperate need\".The RSF accused the army of attacking the Adre crossing because it was used for the \"delivery of aid and commercial supplies\". According to the Sudan War Monitor, a group of researchers tracking the conflict, the attack caused civilian casualties and significant damage to a market.The military did not immediately comment on the reports from Darfur.Wedged between Sudan's capital Khartoum and Darfur, the region made up of North Kordofan, South Kordofan and West Kordofan has been a frontline in the civil war.The battle for the Kordofans - which have a population of almost eight million - has intensified as the army pushes towards Darfur.",

    "body": "23 hours agoDaniela Relph,Royal correspondentandAmy WalkerThe Duchess of Sussex has attempted to contact her estranged father, Thomas Markle, who is reported to be seriously ill in hospital in the Philippines.A spokesman for Meghan said: \"I can confirm she has reached out to her father.\"Mr Markle is reported to have had his leg amputated during surgery. The BBC understands that Meghan tried to contact him earlier today, but it is not clear whether the attempt was successful. The relationship between Meghan and her father broke down in the run-up to her wedding to Prince Harry in 2018.During the couple's engagement, the media interest in Thomas Markle and his family was intense. Mr Markle was found to have colluded with photographers who paid him for photos appearing to show the father of the bride preparing for the wedding.The fallout saw him pull out of his daughter's wedding just days before the ceremony in Windsor, citing health problems.King Charles III - who was then the Prince of Wales - walked Meghan down the aisle instead.It is not clear if Meghan ever resumed any proper relationship with her father following her marriage. Thomas Markle is not believed to have met Harry and Meghan's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.He was critical of his daughter and son-in-law's decision to step back from public duty in the UK and criticise the royal family. In one media interview he said: \"I think they're both turning into lost souls at this point.\"\"I don't know what they're looking for,\" he added. \"I don't think they know what they're looking for.\"",

    "body": "A National Guardsman is on the mend after he was critically injured in an ambush-style shooting last month in Washington DC. The parents of Andrew Wolfe, 24, say \"his head wound is slowly healing and that he's beginning to 'look more like himself,'\" said West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey. The family expects the Air Force staff sergeant to be in acute care for the next two to three weeks, and they feel optimistic about his progress, said the governor in a statement.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of two West Virginia National Guard members shot when a gunman opened fire not far from the White House on 26 November. His colleague, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, died from her injuries. \"We continue to ask all West Virginians and Americans for their prayers!\" the governor said in his statement. Morrisey attended a vigil on Friday evening for Staff Sgt Wolfe at Musselman High School in Inwood, West Virginia, where the guardsman was once a student.A pastor at the vigil read a message from the soldier's parents, Jason and Melody Wolfe.\"We know that there is a long road to go,\" they wrote, according to local news outlet Metro News. \"But our faith keeps us hopeful. We remain grateful for the prayers and the support from people all over the world.\"Earlier in the week, the governor said Staff Sgt Wolfe had responded to a nurse with a thumbs-up and was able to move his toes.Police have charged the suspected shooter, an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, with first-degree murder and assault with intent to kill.Before coming to the US in 2021, he was once a counterterrorism soldier in a CIA-backed unit that worked with American troops in Afghanistan.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of 2,000 National Guard members whom President Donald Trump deployed to the nation's capitol in August as part of his immigration and crime-related crackdown in Democratic-led cities. Following the shooting, Trump said he wanted another 500 National Guard troops sent to the nation's capital. The Trump administration has also cited the shooting as a reason for additional immigration crackdown measures.They have cancelled all citizenship ceremonies for immigrants from 19 countries that were part of a travel ban announced over the summer, including Afghanistan.

    "body": "At least 11 people – including a three-year-old child – have been killed in a mass shooting at a hostel in South Africa.Fourteen others were wounded when gunmen stormed the venue in Saulsville township, west of the capital Pretoria, early on Saturday.At least three unknown gunmen began firing \"randomly\" at a group of people who were drinking, police spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said. The motive of the shooting is unknown and no arrests have been made. It is the latest in a string of mass shootings that have rocked the crime-ridden country in recent years.The gunmen reportedly entered the premise at 04:30 local time (02:30 GMT) and opened fire on a group of men who were drinking. A 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl were among those killed in the attack.\"I can confirm that a total of 25 people were shot,\" Mathe said. Describing the hostel as an \"illegal shebeen\", she added: \"We are having a serious challenge when it comes to these illegal and unlicensed liquor premises,\" where she said the majority of mass shootings occur.\"Innocent people also get caught up in the crossfire,\" she told public broadcaster SABC.In a major crackdown, police shut down 12,000 such premises outlets between April and September this year and arrested more than 18,000 people across the country.South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, at 45 people per 100,000 according to 2023-24 figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Some 63 people were killed every day between April and September, according to police data.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSebastian UsherBBC Middle East analystThe Iranian judiciary says two organisers of a marathon have been arrested for allowing women who were not wearing hijabs to take part.The move comes after images appeared online of unveiled women competing in the race on Friday.Two thousand women and 3,000 men took part separately in the marathon on Kish Island off the southern coast of Iran.Dressed in red t-shirts, some of the women competitors were clearly not wearing the hijab or any other head covering.This drew very different reactions. Many supporters of change in Iran enthusiastically hailed the images as further evidence of Iranian women rejecting the restrictions placed by the authorities on what they can wear.For their part, Iranian officials have responded to it as an unacceptable challenge to the status quo.The judiciary has moved quickly against the organisers.It is not just the flouting of the rules on the hijab by some female competitors but that the marathon was held at all that has drawn condemnation from the country theocratic Islamic leadership.Just a few years ago, the sight of so many Iranian women in sports gear participating in such a mass public event – even if segregated from male participants – would have been seen as a contravention.The prosecutor in Kish said the way that the race was being held was in itself a \"violation of public decency\". The issue of the hijab remains at the heart of the debate on where Iran might be going.Government action against women appearing in public without a head covering has varied - sometimes permitting a loosening of the rules, at others mounting a clampdown on any transgression.The mass protests that rocked Iran for months three years ago were triggered by the death of the young Kurdish Iranian woman, Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after being detained over an alleged breach of the dress code.Since the protests were quelled through force and mass arrests, some Iranian women have continued to defy the rules.That has prompted a recent pushback by the authorities.The head of the judiciary has warned of a renewed campaign against women not wearing the hijab in public.Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said that intelligence agencies had been ordered to identify and report on what he called \"organised trends promoting immorality and non-veiling\". There is clearly no end for now in the standoff between Iran's leaders and many of its own people – particularly in the younger generation – over how women are allowed to dress.",

    "body": "5 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, BethlehemReutersFor two years during the Gaza war, all public celebrations for Christmas were cancelled in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank – where Christians believe Jesus was born.But after the recent ceasefire, the holy city decided that this year the festivities would return as symbolised by the lighting of its traditional, giant Christmas tree in front of the historic Nativity Church.\"It's been a bad two years of silence; no Christmas, no jobs, no work,\" says Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati. \"We're all living here from tourism and tourism was down to zero.\"The mayor accepts that the idea of resuming celebrations was not without controversy, as suffering continues in Gaza – including for those in its tiny Christian community, many of whom have relatives in Bethlehem.\"Some may say it's not appropriate and others say it's appropriate,\" Mr Canawati tells me. \"But deep inside my heart, I felt that this was the right thing to do because Christmas should never be stopped or cancelled. This is the light of hope for us.\"Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to BethlehemOne tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare systemAlaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurantThe grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.",

    "body": "22 hours agoBrandon Drenon,Washington DC andMadeline HalpertThe US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on whether some children born in the US have a constitutional right to citizenship.On his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump signed an order to end birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are in the country illegally, but the move was blocked by multiple lower courts.No date has been set yet for the Supreme Court arguments, and a ruling is months away.Whatever the court decides could have major implications for Trump's immigration crackdown and for what it means to be an American citizen.For nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces.The language of the amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"Trump's executive order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or are in the country on temporary visas. It is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reform the nation's immigration system and combat what they have called \"significant threats to national security and public safety\".The administration has argued the 14th Amendment clause \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the amendment excludes children of people who are not in the country permanently or lawfully.Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, told the BBC's news partner CBS that no president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,\"  Ms Wang said in a statement. \"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term,\" she added.The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.After legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal  court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.Trump then went to the Supreme Court to fight the injunctions. In a win for Trump, the court ruled in June that the injunctions issued by the lower courts exceeded their authority, though it did not address the issue of birthright citizenship itself. The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.US Solicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the amendment was adopted \"to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens\".He has said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on US soil confers citizenship and has argued that that understanding has had \"destructive consequences\"About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2016 - a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007, according to The Pew Research Center.By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.A study published in May by the thinktank Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University's Population Research Institute suggested that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the size of the unauthorized population in the US by an additional 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.",

    "description": "A US panel of vaccine advisers has voted to end the longstanding recommendation for vaccinations against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) right after birth",
    "body": "A US panel of vaccine advisers has voted to end the longstanding recommendation for vaccinations against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) right after birth. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip) voted 8-3 to back \"individual-based decision-making\" on whether to vaccinate babies born to mothers who have tested negative for the liver infection.  In June, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, fired all the members of the Acip and replaced them with others who are critical of vaccines.The US has recommended vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B since 1991, and data suggests that since then, the shots have prevented an estimated 90,000 deaths.Hours after the decision, President Donald Trump ordered his top health officials to review all childhood vaccination recommendations in the US. In a White House memo, he requested that they \"review best practices from peer, developed countries for core childhood vaccination recommendations\".  If they find other countries' practices are superior, then Trump directs them to change the US schedule.He noted in the memo that some other countries recommend fewer immunisations for children.Trump also praised the advisory committee for their Friday decision, calling it \"very good\" in a social media post. The Acip is responsible for making recommendations to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on when and who should be vaccinated. The acting director of the CDC has the final sign-off on the recommendation. The new guidance also suggests that babies who do not receive a birth dose of the vaccine should get their initial dose of the shot \"no earlier than two months of age\", a recommendation that several members of the group opposed. Public health experts worry the vote could raise unfounded safety concerns about the vaccine and encourage some people to opt out, leading to more sickness.The concern was shared by some members of the Acip panel.\"The hepatitis B vaccine recommendation is very well established,\" Dr Cody Meissner said before voting no. \"We know it's safe and we know it's very effective. And to make the changes that are being proposed, we will see more children and adolescents and adults infected with hepatitis B.\"The panel continues to recommend that babies born to mothers who have tested positive for hepatitis B be given a birth dose of the vaccine. The move is not expected to affect insurance coverage of the shot. Hepatitis B is a liver infection that spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids, and can lead to dangerous liver conditions including cancer, liver failure and cirrhosis. Pregnant people who have hepatitis B also can transmit the virus to newborns during delivery, which can lead to chronic infections that can damage the liver.People infected with HBV do not always have symptoms, meaning they may not even be aware they are carrying the virus and can spread it while caring for children and infants.Friday's decision came after a tense two-day meeting on the issue, after the Acip decided to postpone a vote on the hepatitis B shots two times.  On Friday, several members of the panel voiced their objections to the new guidelines, and in particular, that shots be recommended no sooner than two months of age. The voting choices are \"incredibly problematic\", Dr Joseph Hibbeln said, while Dr Meissner said members were acting on \"baseless sceptisicm\".One committee member in favour of the change, Retsef Levi, said the US hepatitis B vaccine policy was \"misaligned\" with other countries around the world.The World Health Organization recommends vaccinating children against HBV at zero, one and six-months old. In the UK, vaccines are recommended at eight weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks old, unless a mother has tested positive for the virus.During hours of meetings on Thursday and Friday, the committee heard from several physicians, including many who criticised the panel for considering ending universal vaccination recommendations.Committee members who voted in favour of the new recommendations argued that the risk of catching the virus was low and that vaccines should be tailored to individual patients.Critics of the birth dose have argued that babies should only be vaccinated as newborns if their mother tests positive for the virus. But doctors say this leaves some babies at risk, because not all pregnant people have reliable access to testing, while others could receive a false negative test for hepatitis B.Kennedy and his allies have questioned the safety of the hepatitis B vaccine and have argued it is primarily spread through sexual contact and sharing needles.Research has shown, however, that it can also spread through indirect contact such as shared toothbrushes and razors.Since taking office, Kennedy has made a number of changes to US vaccine policy. The Acip's decision to revisit the vaccine recommendations sparked anger from Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician who cast a deciding vote in confirming Kennedy as health secretary despite worries about his previous stances on vaccines.\"As a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B for decades, this change to the vaccine schedule is a mistake,\" Cassidy said in a statement. \"The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. The birth dose is a recommendation, NOT a mandate.\"In response to the committee's vote, Maryland's state health department issued an issued an advisory on Friday, citing a recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics, urging health care providers and hospitals to continue to offer the hep B vaccines at birth and said it was working to secure access to the vaccine for all infants and children in the state.",

    "body": "North American leaders take stage together for the first time21 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,at the White HouseandNadine Yousif,in Toronto Watch: World Cup hosts Trump, Sheinbaum and Carney take stage togetherIt was all smiles at Washington DC's Kennedy Centre as the leaders of the US, Mexico and Canada took the stage for the 2026 World Cup draw, even as trade tensions simmered in the background.For Donald Trump, the brief interaction marked his first meeting with Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum, who leads the largest trading partner for the US. While Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has already met with Trump several times, trade talks have been halted. Trump this week signalled that the US is still weighing whether it will leave in place a single long-standing free trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico or look at separate bilateral deals.The agreement - known as the USMCA - is up for a mandatory review next year. Carney has credited it with shielding Canadian businesses from the bulk of US-imposed tariffs on Canada. Those underlying tensions seemed distant on Friday, when the leaders took the stage together to select the balls of their own countries from bowls, marking the beginning of a process to select groups for the initial stage of the jointly-hosted tournament. The leaders' body language appeared cordial and warm. Collectively, they posed for a selfie with Fifa President Gianni Infantino on stage. Reporters later saw Trump sitting with Sheinbaum, who had said earlier in the week that she planned to have a brief one-on-one with Trump to discuss trade matters, including steel, aluminium and automobile tariffs, on the sidelines of the event.The Trump administration has largely backed away from threats to impose steep tariffs as negotiations continue. Carney was sitting beside Sheinbaum. Both have expressed an interest in securing the future of the USMCA, which has been in place in some form since 1994. Its fate is uncertain pending the outcome of the mandatory review due to be completed in the summer of 2026.Trump also met for a brief 45 minutes with Sheinbaum and Carney on Friday.In a statement, Sheinbaum said they talked about the World Cup and separately  \"agreed to continue working together on trade issues with our teams\".Carney's office said the three agreed to keep working together on the USMCA. Getty ImagesThe US, Mexico and Canada are jointly hosting next year's Fifa World Cup. Trump told reporters in the White House on Wednesday that the US will \"either let it expire, or we'll maybe work out another deal with Mexico and Canada\".He added that he believed both Canada and Mexico had \"taken advantage\" of the US.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told news outlet Politico on Thursday that Trump is considering dividing the agreement into two parts.\"Our relationship with the Canadian economy is totally different than our relationship with the Mexican economy,\" Greer said, adding: \"It actually doesn't make a ton of economic sense why we would marry those three together.\"The current USMCA deal was signed by Trump during his first term. At the time, he praised it as \"the best agreement we've ever made\".American businesses have so far signalled that they want the trade agreement to remain in place.At a three-day public hearing about the coming review of the agreement in Washington this week, speakers from agriculture, business and policy groups said it has allowed them to access Canadian and Mexican markets.The World Cup draw also saw President Trump receive the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize, which Infantino said was \"in recognition of his exceptional and extraordinary actions to promote peace and unity around the world\".In brief remarks, Trump said that award was \"one of the honours\" of his life.

    "body": "4 hours agoNardine SaadandHarry SekulichRussia has launched a major aerial bombardment against Ukrainian infrastructure targets as talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida are set to enter a third day.Overnight Russia launched 653 drones and 51 missiles, most of which were downed, authorities said. One strike hit a railway hub at the town of Fastiv southwest of Kyiv, destroying the main station building and damaging rolling stock.Russia says it targeted military-industrial sites, and energy and port infrastructure.Condemning the new attacks, French President Emmanuel Macron announced he would go to London on Monday for a meeting with Ukrainian, British and German leaders aimed at putting pressure on Moscow. \"We must continue to put pressure on Russia to force it towards peace,\" Macron posted on X.He said he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in London to take stock of the ongoing negotiations being mediated by the US.     Earlier US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\" after talks in Moscow failed to produce a breakthrough.Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy sector and infrastructure in recent weeks. On Saturday Ukraine's energy ministry said Russian attacks had hit energy facilities in eight regions, causing blackouts. Zelensky said the attack on the rail hub had been \"meaningless from a military point of view, and the Russians could not have been unaware of this\".Meanwhile the UN's nuclear watchdog said the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had temporarily lost all external power overnight - the 11th time this has happened since Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour.While it is not currently producing electricity, it needs power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.In Florida, a statement posted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff said two days of talks with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's national security council, had been \"constructive\".Witkoff and Umerov \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" that could such an agreement and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\", their statement said without giving details.The prospect of ending the war depended on Russia's readiness to take \"steps towards de-escalation and cessation of killing\", the statement added.The negotiations, which are also attended by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, will continue for a third day on Saturday. The Florida talks saw Ukraine's team briefed on a recent meeting between Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Witkoff spent almost five hours with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, after which the Kremlin said \"no compromise\" had been reached on a draft US peace plan. The Kremlin said Putin was ready to continue meeting the Americans \"as many times as needed\", but Ukraine and its allies in Europe have called into question the Russian leader's commitment to ending the war.On Friday, Zelensky said he wanted to \"obtain full information about what was said in Moscow and what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war\".Kyiv pushed for revisions to the initial US peace plan, which was widely seen as favourable to Moscow when an initial version leaked to the media. An updated version has not been shared publicly.Major points of contention remain between the two sides, including security guarantees for Ukraine post-war and territorial concessions. Russia currently controls roughly one-fifth of Ukraine's territory, including swathes of the Donbas area in the east – made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In an interview with India Today on Friday, Putin warned Ukrainian troops to withdraw fully from the region this week, saying Russia would otherwise \"liberate these [Donbas] territories by force\".Kyiv and its European allies believe the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato, or to provide comprehensive security guarantees. Russia is staunchly opposed, while Trump too has repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Ukraine join the military alliance.The prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a \"key question\" that was tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.Trump said those talks were \"reasonably good\", but it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoSakshi Venkatraman,US reporterandHarry SekulichREUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoFrank Gehry, one of the most influential architects of the last century, has died aged 96.Gehry was acclaimed for his avant garde, experimental style of architecture. His titanium-covered design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, catapulted him to fame in 1997. His breakthrough in the architectural world came years earlier when he redesigned his own home in Santa Monica, California, using materials like chain-link fencing, plywood, and corrugated steel.His death was confirmed by his chief of staff Meaghan Lloyd. He is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Leslie and Brina, as well as his wife, Berta Isabel Aguilera, and their two sons, Alejandro and Samuel.Getty ImagesThe Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, one of Gehry's most famous worksBorn in Toronto in 1929, Gehry moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to study architecture at the University of Southern California, before completing further study at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1956 and 1957.After starting his own firm, he broke from traditional architectural principles of symmetry, using unconventional geometric shapes and unfinished materials in a style now known as deconstructivism. Through blending unexpected materials and sheathing buildings in stainless steel to create curvy exteriors, Gehry created buildings that took on arresting sculptural shapes.Later in his career, Gehry used 3D modelling similar to that used by aerospace engineers to shape windy buildings, a practice largely avoided by other architects because of the complexity and costliness of construction.In 1989, at the age of 60, Gehry was awarded the industry's top accolade, the Pritzker Architecture prize, for lifetime achievement.The Pritzker jury said his work possessed a \"highly refined, sophisticated and adventurous aesthetic\".\"His designs, if compared to American music, could best be likened to Jazz, replete with improvisation and a lively unpredictable spirit,\" the panel said at the time.Gehry's international breakthrough with the Guggenheim transformed the city of Bilbao, boosting tourism to the city and the local economy. Crafted out of titanium sheets, limestone, and glass, the museum was instantly celebrated as a modern marvel.Architect Philip Johnson, Gehry's American contemporary, described the structure as \"the greatest building of our time\". Other cities tried to replicate its success, branded the \"Bilbao effect\", where investment in daring art could revitalise ailing economies.The cultural phenomenon was parodied in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, in which the fictional town of Springfield invites Gehry, who voiced himself in the cartoon TV show, to design a new concert hall. In the episode, the shape of the concert hall is jokingly inspired by a letter Gehry had scrunched up.The guest appearance later \"haunted\" Gehry, who told the Observer in 2011 that people sincerely believed his real-life designs were inspired by crumpled paper instead of complex computations.'Pushing the envelope'His work in Bilbao put him in high demand, and he went on to design iconic structures in cities all over the world: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park, the Gehry Tower in Germany, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. \"He bestowed upon Paris and upon France his greatest masterpiece,\" said Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, the worlds largest luxury goods company which owns Louis Vuitton.With a largely unpredictable style, no two of his works look the same. Prague's Dancing House, finished in 1996, looks like a glass building folding in on itself; his Hotel Marques in Spain, built in 2006, features thin sheets of wavy, multicoloured metal; his design for a business school in Sydney looks like a brown paper bag.Gehry also designed the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, layered in metal resembling sails billowing in the wind. After it opened in 2003, critics described it as a \"pile of broken crockery\", a \"fortune cookie gone berserk\" and an \"emptied waste basket\".In a 2007 interview with the New Yorker, Gehry shrugged off the concert hall's critics: \"At least they're looking!\" he quipped. Tributes are celebrating his eagerness to discard convention - and forge his own creative legacy.Paul Goldberger, author of Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry, came to know Gehry closely, and said he wanted to work \"until the day he died\".\"He was one of the very few architects of our time to engage people emotionally,\" Goldberger told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.\"He was all about pushing the envelope... wanting to use the most advanced technology to do the most adventurous things.\"In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney extended his \"deepest condolences\" to Gehry's family and the \"many admirers of his work\". He added: \"His unmistakable vision lives on in iconic buildings around the world.\"Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum posted a video tribute to Gehry.\"We will be forever grateful,\" the museum wrote on Instagram, \"his spirit and legacy will always remain connected to Bilbao\".",

    "body": "21 hours agoNatalie Sherman,Business reporter,Danielle Kaye,Business reporterandChristal Hayes,Los Angeles senior reporterWarner Brothers DiscoveryNetflix is buying Warner Brothers' streaming services, including HBO, known for shows like Game of Thrones It sounds like a simple merger deal, but it's got all the ingredients of a Hollywood drama: a rich and powerful suitor, political intrigue, and plenty of cliff-hangers.Netflix's deal to buy Warner Brothers Discovery's storied movie studio and popular HBO streaming networks, is a real-life tale of a conquering giant.But with regulators and rivals still waiting in the wings, it's probably just the start of the saga.As the story unfolds, here are five key things to look out for.1. Netflix is becoming even more powerfulNetflix has been pulling ahead in Hollywood for years now, ranking as the world's biggest streaming subscription service and largest producer of new content in California. But this deal - the biggest in the industry for years - would confirm its position at the head of the pack, handing the company a catalogue with nearly a century's worth of titles and beefing up its already formidable production capacity.  That's not to mention its sheer subscriber might, as Netflix prepares to add some of HBO's 128 million subscribers to its already more than 300 million-strong base.\"Netflix is already the biggest streaming service and now you add HBO Max to that and it becomes arguably untouchable,\" said Mike Proulx, vice president at research firm Forrester.Murray Close/Getty ImagesWarner Bros owns the rights to the Harry Potter filmsThe deal will unite beloved historic franchises like Looney Tunes, Harry Potter and Friends and HBO hits like Succession, Sex and the City and Game of Thrones under the same roof as Netflix's less conventional output, including Stranger Things and KPop Demon Hunters.The purchase also includes TNT Sports outside the US.2. It could mean prices go up.... or downNetflix said it hopes to complete the deal in the next year to 18 months.  But executives are coy about how - or whether - they plan to incorporate Warner Brothers and its flagship HBO brand into the existing Netflix service.Netflix's co-chief executive Greg Peters said the HBO name was \"very powerful\" and would give the firm \"a lot of options\", but would not elaborate further.Netflix could package up films and programmes into different bundles, although analysts say they would be surprised to see the HBO brand disappear altogether.The impact on prices is also unclear. Netflix's dominance could allow it to charge customers more. But if viewers find they are paying for one streaming service rather than two, it could cost them less.3. Streaming is the future and Hollywood feels cast asideWarner Bros is one of the studios that defined Hollywood, creating classics such as Casablanca and the The Exorcist.But this takeover is an illustration of how cinema's golden age has faded.The trajectory is clear, Forrester's Mr Proulx said, the future is \"all-streaming\".\"With this deal it is official: legacy media is ending.\"Netflix has promised to keep releasing films in cinemas, a decision that makes some sense as it will be acquiring the DC superhero franchise, films that do very well in movie theatres.But not everyone believes that will remain a priority for the streamer.After all, earlier this year Netflix's co-chief executive officer Ted Sarandos said he believed movie-going was an \"outdated concept\". And the consolidation touches a nerve in an industry already wrestling with earlier job cuts, decline in productions and the threat of artificial intelligence.Titanic director James Cameron was one of many in Hollywood to greet the deal with dismay, warning just before it was announced, that he thought it would prove a \"disaster\"  for the industry.4. The deal is not yet doneCompletion of the deal is far from certain.  First, Warner Brothers Discovery has to complete the spin-off of the parts of its business that it is not selling to Netflix, including CNN, Discovery and Eurosport. Meanwhile rival suitor Paramount Skydance, which had hoped to buy the entire Warner Brothers Discovery business, may yet try to convince shareholders it can offer a better alternative. Warner Brothers DiscoverySuccession, starring Jeremy Strong and Sarah Snook, drew large audiences for HBOThe biggest question however, is whether the deal will get approval from competition regulators in the US and Europe - something that could pose a major challenge.In Washington lawmakers from both parties have already chimed in against the deal, citing worries it will lead to fewer choices for consumers and higher prices. Mr Sarandos said Netflix, which has to pay Warner Brothers $5.8bn if the deal falls apart, was \"highly confident\" it would win approval. It will hinge in part on how regulators define the competitive landscape, said Jonathan Barnett, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. If regulators only look at video streaming, Netflix's increased share of the market could raise significant red flags. But if regulators adopt a broader definition, one that includes cable and broadcast TV and even YouTube as Netflix's competitors \"the concentration concerns become less and less\", he said. Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, said usually a merger like this would be a \"clear-cut case for a challenge\", typically pushing for better terms for consumers.This time, she is worried the Trump administration might put pressure on Netflix over questions like diversity and political bias, as has happened in other cases.5. Donald Trump is another wild cardLooming over the debate is whether President Donald Trump will weigh in. This administration has promised a lighter regulatory touch when it comes to mergers.But the president has spoken highly of Paramount Skydance's owners, the tech billionaire and Republican donor Larry Ellison and his son David who are behind the rival bid for Warner Bros. And Trump has always shown a keen interest in the media and entertainment industry.There has been no comment from competition regulators in the US, but a senior Trump administration official told CNBC that it views Netflix's bid for Warner Bros with \"heavy scepticism\".",

    "body": "Single women risk rape and exploitation in search for better life in Europe20 hours agoSofia BettizaGlobal Health Reporter in Trieste, ItalyBBCEsther fled Lagos in 2016Esther was sleeping on the streets of Lagos when a woman approached her with the promise of a route out of Nigeria to a job and a home in Europe.She had dreamt of a new life, especially in the UK. Thrown out of a violent and abusive foster home, she had little to stay for. But when she left Lagos in 2016, crossing the desert to Libya, she had little idea of her traumatic journey ahead, forced into sex work and years of asylum claims in country after country.The majority of irregular migrants and asylum seekers are men - 70% according to the European Agency for Asylum - but the number of women like Esther, who have come to Europe to seek asylum is on the rise.\"We are seeing an increase in women travelling alone, both on the Mediterranean and the Balkan routes,\" says Irini Contogiannis from the International Rescue Committee in Italy.Its 2024 report highlighted a 250% annual rise in the number of single adult women arriving in Italy on the Balkan route, while families grew by 52%.Migrant routes are notoriously treacherous. Last year 3,419 migrant deaths or disappearances in Europe were recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - the deadliest year on record.But for women, there is the added threat of sexual violence and exploitation, which happened to Esther after she was betrayed by the woman who had promised her a better life.\"She locked me up in a room and brought in a man. He had sex with me, with force. I was still a virgin,\" Esther says. \"That's what they do… travel to different villages in Nigeria to pick young girls, and bring them to Libya to become sex slaves.\"\"Their experiences are different and often riskier,\" Ugochi Daniels of the IOM told the BBC. \"Even women travelling in groups often lack consistent protection, exposing them to abuse by smugglers, traffickers, or other migrants.\"Many women are aware of the risks but go anyway, packing condoms, or even getting contraceptive devices fitted in case they are raped on the way.\"All migrants have to pay a smuggler,\" says Hermine Gbedo of the anti-trafficking network Stella Polare. \"But women are often expected to offer sex as part of the payment.\"Ms Gbedo supports women migrants in Trieste, a port city in north-east Italy which has long been a crossroads of cultures and serves as a major entry point to the European Union for those crossing from the Balkans. From here, they continue to countries like Germany, France, and the UK.Barbara Zanon/Getty ImageMost migrants who arrive in Trieste via the Balkan route are maleAfter four months of being exploited in Libya, Esther escaped and crossed the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy from which she was rescued by the Italian coast guard and taken to the island of Lampedusa.She claimed asylum three times before she was granted refugee status.Asylum seekers from countries viewed as safe are often rejected. At the time Italy viewed Nigeria as unsafe, but two years ago it changed that assessment as governments across Europe began tightening their rules in response to the big migrant influx into Europe of 2015-16. Voices calling for further restrictions on asylum claims have only grown louder since.\"It's impossible to sustain mass migration -- there is no way,\" says Nicola Procaccini, an MP in Giorgia Meloni's right wing government. \"We can guarantee a safe life to those women who are really in danger, but not to all of them.\"\"We have to be hard-headed,\" warns Rakib Ehsan at the conservative think tank Policy Exchange. \"We need to prioritise women and girls who are at immediate risk within conflict-affected territories, where rape is being used as a weapon of war.\"Currently this is not happening consistently, he argues, and while he sympathises with the plight of women facing hazardous routes into Europe \"the key is controlled compassion\".However, many women arriving from countries considered safe claim that the abuse they suffered on account of being a woman has meant that life in their home countries has become impossible.This was the case for Nina, a 28-year-old from Kosovo.\"People think everything is well in Kosovo, but that's not true,\" she says. \"Things are terrible for women.\"Nina says she and her sister were sexually abused by their boyfriends who forced them into sex work.A 2019 report by Europe's OSCE security organisation suggested that 54% of women in Kosovo had experienced psychological, physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner since the age of 15.Women who face persecution on the grounds of gender-based violence are entitled to asylum under the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention, and that was backed up by a landmark ruling by the EU's top court last year. The Convention details gender-based violence as psychological, physical and sexual - and includes female genital mutilation (FGM).However, its terms are not yet applied consistently, according to charity groups.\"A lot of asylum officials in the field are men who are insufficiently trained to deal with such a delicate issue [as female genital mutilation] - both medically and psychologically,\" says Marianne Nguena Kana, Director of End FGM European Network.Many women have their asylum claims denied, she says, on the mistaken assumption that, because they have already undergone FGM, they face no further risk.\"We've had judges saying: 'You've already been mutilated, so it's not dangerous for you to go back to your country, because it's not like they can do it to you again,\" Nguena Kana says.International Rescue CommitteeThe International Rescue Committee works with migrants and refugees in ItalyWhen it comes to sexual violence, Carenza Arnold from UK charity Women for Refugee Women says it is often harder to prove, as it does not leave the same scars as physical torture - and the taboos and cultural sensitivities for women make the process even harder.\"Women are frequently rushed through the process and may not disclose the sexual violence they have suffered to an immigration officer they have just met,\" Arnold explains.Much of the violence faced by women takes place during their journey, the International Organization for Migration has told the BBC.\"Women usually escape sexual violence from their partners in their country of origin, and then during the journey, they experience the same again,\" says Ugochi Daniels.This was the case for Nina and her sister on their journey away from their abusive partners in Kosovo to a new life in Italy. Travelling with other women, they trekked through the forests of Eastern Europe trying to avoid the authorities. There, they said they were attacked by male migrants and smugglers.\"Even though we were up in the mountains, in the dark, you could hear the screams,\" Nina recalls. \"The men would come up to us with a torch, shine it in our faces, pick who they wanted, and take them further into the forest.\"At night, I could hear my sister crying, begging for help.\"Nina and her sister told Italian authorities that if they returned home they would be killed by their ex-boyfriends. They were eventually granted asylum.Esther's fight for refugee status took much longer.She first claimed asylum in Italy in 2016, but after a long wait there she moved to France and then Germany, where her asylum claims were rejected as according to the EU's Dublin regulation an asylum seeker is usually expected to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.She was finally awarded refugee status in Italy in 2019.Almost a decade on from leaving Nigeria, she wonders if her current existence in Italy was worth the pain she endured to get there: \"I don't even know the reason why I came to this place.\"",

    "body": "What should you do if you dislike your friend's partner?20 hours agoAnnabel RackhamCulture reporterNetflixOn the Netflix show Selling Sunset, Chrishell Stause (right) has fallen out with Emma Hernan (left), which has started a debate about friends' partnersIt's supposed to be a TV series about Los Angeles' biggest and most beautiful homes - but the people selling them often steal the show. And the latest episodes of Netflix reality series Selling Sunset, now in its ninth season, have started a debate about how to deal with a friend's \"toxic\" partner.Two stars of the programme - real estate agents Chrishell Stause and Emma Hernan - have been feuding on and off-camera over Emma's boyfriend Blake Davis, who Chrishell dislikes.It boiled over during an end-of-season reunion and led to online debates about how, or even whether, you can stay friends with someone whose partner you dislike.We've spoken to a woman with first-hand experience of that dilemma and two relationship experts about what to do in this tricky situation.Friends falling outNetflixStause and Hernan became friends by starring on Selling Sunset togetherIn the show, Stause, 44, says she's never approved of Hernan's relationship with property developer Davis. She claims he \"love-bombed\" Hernan early in the relationship and that there were \"huge red flags\". Love bombing often involves someone showering a partner with gifts, attention and various promises.Hernan has told Netflix's online publication she \"doesn't fault\" Stause for trying to protect her but that she would like Stause to \"step back and realise\" her level of love and support. She has also said: \"I have enjoyed my time with him... Everyone can say what they want - or they can either love him or hate him. But ultimately, it's my choice who I end up with.\"Some of us will have experienced similar situations first-hand. Hannah, who didn't want to give her last name, told BBC News she fell out with her long-time friend, Georgia - not her real name - over a partner.Hannah says Georgia \"had a history of dating not very nice people\" and moved away from London with a new partner who \"proposed to her fairly quickly, I think within about a year\".It felt like Georgia was \"under his spell\" - and then on a night out before the wedding, Hannah says, Georgia's fiancé made sexual comments about Hannah. \"He came over to me and started to tell me all the things he wanted to do to me in a very graphic, explicit way.\"She says the experience was \"very uncomfortable\" and \"came out of nowhere\".When Hannah told Georgia about it a few days later, Georgia \"tried to minimise it and was saying things like 'he does that with all his female friends' and I was trying to explain to her that he was saying really inappropriate things\", Hannah says.What you can do, according to a relationship expertJames RudlandAnna Williamson says it is important to be careful when dealing with friends whose partners we don't likeRelationship expert and counsellor Anna Williamson, who works as a dating expert on Channel 4's Celebs Go Dating, says trying to support a friend if you're concerned about their partner can be difficult.It's important not to judge or tell them what to do, she says. Judging your friend can lead to them behaving defensively, but finding the line between supporting and judging is a \"real challenge\".\"We need to be really careful to compartmentalise our own emotions and not project onto a friend, as they might not recognise they're in a toxic relationship,\" she tells the BBC. \"They might be carrying feelings of shame and masking it.\"She advises starting a conversation with a friend by telling them something like: \"I care about you so much but I want to check in because I've noticed that you seem really stressed lately.\"Williamson adds it is important to \"stick to facts\" and only discuss things with them that you have observed. She recommends avoiding phrases such as \"I really don't like them\", \"I think they're toxic\" or \"I think they're abusive\".If you still want to see your friend but don't want to be around their partner, Williamson says it can be handled delicately. \"I'd say something like, 'I really care about you, but I need to take some space from your partner because I'm not comfortable with their behaviour, but I really want to spend time with you.'\"It's also important to make sure you have support around you, as looking out for someone else all the time can be draining, she says.Yasmin Shaheen-Zaffar, a relationship and trauma counsellor, says that from watching Selling Sunset, some of the tension comes from cast members talking behind each other's backs and then being confronted about it later on.\"Avoid gossiping and talking about your friend or about their partner to others who could whip up hysteria,\" Shaheen-Zaffar tells the BBC. She says it's important to \"keep yourself safe\" because anything you say \"could be taken out of context or used against you\".'Try to remain civil'What if you disagree with the views or values of a friend's partner?On Selling Sunset, Stause and Hernan argue over Davis's views on politics. Davis was set to appear on the ninth season of Selling Sunset, but had his scenes cut after another storyline involving Hernan was deemed more relevant. It's not known whether any of the scenes featured disagreements between Davis and Stause, but Hernan has denied that Davis expressed \"political views\" in front of Stause.Shaheen-Zaffar says that ultimately you \"have to respect individual people's decisions\" and \"try to remain civil\" if you still want that friend to be part of your life. \"I think we have developed a culture where if someone doesn't agree with what we think we don't like them,\" she says.This is not the advice she says she would give if someone is being openly \"bigoted\", but more if they just have views you don't agree with. \"It takes a lot of self-development and digging deep to understand and accept other people's views,\" she adds.Whether you can cope with a friend's partner's conflicting views depends on what \"aligns with your values\", she says.Sometimes, a partner's actions may be too much for you - and it can break friendships entirely.After what happened with Georgia's partner, Hannah came to the conclusion that she could not see her friend again if she chose to stay with him.\"I told her 'I love you, the door is always open but I can't have him in my life' - he wasn't a good, healthy presence and I was very uncomfortable and frightened,\" Hannah adds.She says Georgia and her haven't spoken since and the friendship ending \"really hurt\". She and Georgia had \"been friends for a long time and had a lot of fun together\" - although she ultimately wouldn't have done anything differently in hindsight, she says.More weekend picks",

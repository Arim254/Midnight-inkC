    "body": "Scientists believe they have recorded electrical activity in the Martian atmosphere for the first time, suggesting the planet is capable of lightning.Nasa's Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology and has spent the last four years exploring the Jezero Crater region.Electrical discharges nicknamed \"mini lightning\" were picked up from audio and electromagnetic recordings made by the rover's SuperCam instrument.Scientists hope new instruments for measuring atmospheric discharges and more-sensitive cameras could be sent to Mars to try to confirm the findings.A team of researchers from France analysed 28 hours of microphone recordings made by the Nasa rover over two Martian years (or 1,374 Earth days).They found that electrical discharges were normally associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts.Dust devils are small whirlwinds that form from hot air rising from the ground, and their internal movements can give rise to electrical discharges.Lead author of the research Dr Baptiste Chide told news agency Reuters: \"These discharges represent a major discovery, with direct implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability and the future of robotic and human exploration.\"He and other scientists at the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in France believe that Mars now joins Earth, Saturn and Jupiter as planets known to have atmospheric electrical activity.Particle physicist Dr Daniel Pritchard wrote in scientific journal Nature that, although the recordings would \"provide persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges\", because the discharges were only heard and not seen, \"some doubt will inevitably remain as to whether this really was Martian lightning\". He added: \"Given the history of this field, the debate is likely to continue for some time.\"In September this year, scientists found rocks with unusual markings on Mars. The intriguing markings, nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds, contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient microbes.It is possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found.Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life.Perseverance was dispatched to the Jezero Crater because it showed qualities that may have meant it was once conducive to life, including signs it was once a delta when Mars could sustain liquid surface water.",

    "body": "23 hours agoJon Donnison,JerusalemandDoug FaulknerWatch: BBC correspondent examines footage showing moments leading up to shooting in the occupied West BankVideo has emerged showing Israeli security forces shooting dead two Palestinians who appeared to have surrendered in the occupied West Bank.The incident happened during an ongoing Israeli military operation in the city of Jenin. The Palestinian Authority (PA) accused Israeli forces of committing a \"war crime\" and described the killings as \"brutal\" field executions.The Israeli military and police say the men were wanted men \"affiliated with a terror network\" and the incident is under review. Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has given his full backing to the officers involved, adding that \"terrorists must die\".The video shows two Palestinian men come out of a building with their hands up. They are surrounded by a number of Israeli border guards. They then kneel on the ground. One of them lifts his t-shirt, apparently to show that he is not armed.After a short period, they move back into the building. Border police then open fire, killing them.A joint statement from the IDF and police said forces had been trying to apprehend wanted individuals who had carried out \"terror activities\", including throwing explosives and firing at security forces.\"The forces entered the area, enclosed the structure in which the suspects were located, and initiated a surrender procedure that lasted several hours,\" the statement said.\"Following the use of engineering tools on the structure, the two suspects exited. Following their exit, fire was directed toward the suspects.\"Writing on X, Ben-Gvir said \"the fighters acted exactly as expected of them\".The raid in Jenin is the latest in a months-long Israeli campaign in cities in the northern West Bank, which Israel says is necessary to tackle Palestinian armed groups it says were responsible for attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers. On Wednesday the Israeli military launched an operation in the nearby city of Tubas.Violence in the West Bank has spiked since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which led to a devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza.Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, including members of armed groups and civilians, in the West Bank since then, the UN says. At least 44 Israelis, including soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during Israeli military operations, Israel says. ",

    "body": "Venezuela has banned six major international airlines from landing in the country after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights there.The airlines had temporarily suspended their routes into the capital, Caracas, after the US warned of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.Angered by this, the Venezuelan government issued the carriers with an ultimatum that expired on Wednesday. While a number of smaller airlines continue to fly to Venezuela, thousands of passengers have been affected.The US has deployed a large force to waters off Venezuela, which it says is to combat drug trafficking but which Venezuela's leader has denounced as an attempt to overthrow him. Venezuela's civil aviation authority, which reports to the country's ministry of transport, announced on Wednesday that Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines would lose their landing and take-off rights with immediate effect.In a reference to the heightened US military activity off the coast of Venezuela, it also accused the airlines of \"joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government and unilaterally suspending air commercial operations\".The US has deployed 15,000 troops and the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, to within striking distance of Venezuela.Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near VenezuelaThe US says the aim of the deployment, the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989, is to combat drug trafficking.US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they say were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, they have not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs and many analysts have pointed out that the US deployment is unusually large for a counter-narcotics operation. The Venezuelan government thinks the aim of the operation is to depose President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged. Amid the rising tensions, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued a warning on Friday to flight operators operating in Maiquetía, the international airport serving Caracas. It urged airlines \"to exercise caution... at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".It was in the wake of that warning that the now-banned airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela. An attempt by aviation industry body Iata to defuse the situation - by stressing that its member airlines were keen to restore operations - failed to appease the Venezuelan government.In recent days, both Maduro and his US counterpart Donald Trump have signalled a willingness to hold direct talks.Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said that he \"might talk\" to Maduro, but also warned that \"we can do things the easy way, that's fine, and if we have to do it the hard way that's fine, too\".Maduro, meanwhile, uploaded a video of himself driving around Caracas pointing to Christmas decorations, in what appeared to be an attempt to show that life in the city was going on as normal.",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has doubled down on his core demands for ending the war in Ukraine, saying Russia will lay down arms only if Kyiv's troops withdraw from territory claimed by Moscow.Putin has long pushed for legal recognition of the Ukrainian territories Russia has seized by force. They include the southern Crimean peninsula, annexed in 2014, and the eastern Donbas region, which Moscow now occupies for the most part.For Kyiv, which has ruled out relinquishing the parts of the Donbas it still holds, rewarding Russia for its aggression is a non-starter.Speaking after Putin's address, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia \"scorned\" efforts \"to truly end the war\".Speaking to reporters during a trip to Kyrgyzstan, Putin accused Kyiv of wanting to fight \"to the last Ukrainian\" - which he said Russia was \"in principle\" also ready to do. He repeated his view that Russia has the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from Donbas, which is made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" he said.Yet Russia's slow gains in eastern Ukraine have come at significant cost of manpower. According to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, at this rate it would take Moscow almost two more years to seize the rest of the Donetsk region. Thursday's remarks were the first time that Putin addressed the hectic diplomatic moves of the last week, which saw the US and Ukraine hold intense discussions over a peace plan reportedly drafted in October by American and Russian officials.The plan, which was heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, was subsequently revised during talks between Ukrainian and US negotiators in Geneva. European representatives were also in the Swiss city.But it is thought it does not address the issue of the occupied territories which - alongside security guarantees for Ukraine - is the biggest sticking point between Moscow and Kyiv.Putin said that new draft plan has now been shown to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.However, he added it was \"absolutely necessary\" to discuss \"certain specific points that need to be put in diplomatic language\".Asked about the possibility of Crimea and the Donbas being recognised as under Russian de facto control but not legally, Putin said: \"This is the point of our discussion with our American counterparts\".A US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week, he confirmed. US President Donald Trump told reporters that Witkoff may be joined in Moscow by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Zelensky said in a video address late on Thursday that Ukrainian and US delegations would meet \"to translate the points we secured in Geneva into a form that puts us on the path to peace and security guarantees.\" The Ukrainian president did not mention any names, but his chief of staff Andriy Yermak had said US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was due to visit Kyiv later in the week.On Wednesday Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement\" between Russia and Ukraine – indicating that any meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss these points was contingent on a peace deal being agreed upon.During his comments to reporters Putin again expressed his contempt for the Ukrainian leadership, which he said he considered illegitimate. There was therefore \"no use\" signing any documents with them, he added.Ukraine has been under martial law since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has therefore been unable to hold scheduled elections. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament voted unanimously to affirm the legitimacy of President Zelensky, whose term in office ended in the spring. Putin also dismissed warnings by European leaders that Russia could attack the European continent within the next decades.\"That sounds laughable to us, really,\" he said.The White House and Donald Trump have sounded optimistic about the recent diplomatic push for peace talks, but Europeans have repeatedly expressed their scepticism over whether Putin truly intended to end the war. On Wednesday European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of upholding a post-World War Two mindset and of seeing the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\" in which sovereign nations could be \"carved up\".",

    "body": "Peru's former President Pedro Castillo is among two of the South American nation's ex-leaders to be handed prison sentences in as many days.The left-wing leader was given 11 years in jail on Thursday for attempting to disband Peru's Congress and rule by decree in 2022. The gamble failed, and he was impeached and arrested.He was found guilty of \"conspiracy to commit rebellion\" by the Supreme Court, which handed down the sentence at the same time as convicting him.Castillo's sentence comes just a day after another former Peruvian president, Martín Vizcarra, was handed 14 years' in prison for bribe-taking while serving as a regional governor.The centrist politician, who had championed the fight against corruption during his term in office, was found guilty of taking bribes while governor of the Moquegua region between 2011 and 2014.Prosecutors said he received bribes worth more than $600,000 (£453,753) from construction companies who were seeking contracts for public works. Vizcarra has always maintained his innocence.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court acquitted Castillo of two other charges.Dubbed Peru's first poor president, Castillo, a former trade unionist and rural schoolteacher, won power in 2021 on a wave of frustration with conventional politics.His arrest and impeachment sparked deadly mass protests in 2022 among his working-class rural base. The protests were brutally repressed by security forces, leaving at least 50 dead.On Thursday, dozens of Castillo's supporters gathered outside the prison he is being held in to await the verdict, according to AFP.One supporter, Julia Buendia, told the news agency she still believed Castillo was innocent.Vizcarra and Castillo are the latest in a series of former Peruvian presidents to be jailed for misconduct. Ollanta Humala, who served as the nation's president between 2011 and 2016, was found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison earlier this year.Meanwhile, Alejandro Toledo, who governed it from 2001 to 2006, was sentenced last year to more than 20 years in prison for taking $35m (£26m) in bribes from a construction company.Peru has been beset by political crises in recent years.In October, clashes between anti-government protesters and riot police in the Peruvian capital, Lima, left one man and more than 100 injured.The protests came after the current President José Jerí was sworn in on an interim basis following the impeachment of his predecessor, Dina Boluarte.Boluarte was ousted by lawmakers on grounds of \"permanent moral incapacity\" amid soaring crime rates in Peru. Her presidency was overshadowed by several investigations, including a corruption inquiry dubbed \"Rolexgate\", concerning allegations she accepted Rolex watches as bribes.",

    "body": "24 hours agoJon Donnison,BBC News, JerusalemandTom McArthur,BBC NewsWatch: Mohammed Ibrahim, 16, reunites with family after release from Israeli jailA Palestinian-American teenager who spent nine months in Israeli detention without charge has been freed.Mohammed Ibrahim was 15 when he was arrested in February in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where he was visiting on holiday from Florida, for allegedly throwing stones at Jewish settlers, which he previously denied.The US state department said it welcomed the news of Mohammed's release.The BBC has contacted the Israeli authorities but has not received a reply.Mohammed, now 16, was taken to hospital for treatment immediately after release, relatives told the media. They said he is, pale, underweight and is suffering from conditions contracted in captivity.In a statement, Mohammed's uncle spoke of the family's \"immense relief\". Zeyad Kadur said the family had been \"living a horrific and endless nightmare\" over the last nine months.\"Right now, we are focused on getting Mohammed the immediate medical attention he needs after being subjected to Israel's abuse and inhumane conditions for months. We just want Mohammed to be healthy and to have his childhood back,\" he said.\"Israeli soldiers had no right to take Mohammed from us in the first place,\" he added.The state department said it would continue to provide consular support to Mohammed's family. \"The Trump Administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens,\" it added.Earlier this week Mohammed's father Zahar Ibrahim told the BBC he was frustrated that the US government was not doing more to get his son out of jail.Twenty-seven US lawmakers had signed a letter to the state department and President Donald Trump, demanding more be done to release him.Mr Ibrahim, a father-of-four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, previously said his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.He had not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February, and only heard what had happened to him in detention through court documents.Mohammed was held without charge in Ofer prison on the West Bank. It is also home to adult prisoners, some of whom have been convicted of serious terrorism offences and murder.There are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.Following Mohammed's release, Mr Kadur said the family would also continue fighting for justice for his cousin Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old dual US citizen who the Palestinian health ministry said was beaten to death by Israeli settlers during a confrontation in July. At the time the Israeli military said authorities were looking into reports a Palestinian civilian had been killed.Mohammed and Sayfollah had worked together in the family ice cream shop in Tampa, Florida. No one has been charged with Sayfollah's killing.\"We expect the American government to protect our families,\" Mr Kadur said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJames FitzGeraldandMahfouz ZubaideAFP via Getty ImagesTens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the US withdrawal from the country in 2021Afghans living in the US have condemned Wednesday's \"deeply tragic\" deadly shooting attack in Washington DC, while stressing that the suspect - who moved to the US from Afghanistan four years ago - does not represent them.The alleged gunman, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered America under a programme that offered special immigration protections to Afghans who worked with the US in the wake of the its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in Wednesday's shooting, and a colleague, Andrew Wolfe, 24, is said to be fighting for his life.In response, US President Donald Trump has halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghans, ordered a review of green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries, and threatened a wider crackdown on migrants from what he calls \"third-world countries\".The Afghan Community Coalition of United States expressed its sympathy for families of the victims, calling for a \"comprehensive investigation\" but urging the US government not to delay or suspend Afghan immigration claims.\"Twenty years of Afghan-US partnership must not be forgotten,\" the coalition's statement said, nodding to the two-decade effort launched by the US in 2001 to overthrow Afghanistan's Taliban rulers and establish security in the country.Afghans living in America told the BBC they had been horrified by the Washington DC attack, which they emphasised was the act of just one person.They spoke anonymously out of fear of reprisals by the Taliban, which took back control of Afghanistan following the US troop withdrawal in 2021.One of the Afghans, who made his move after the US withdrawal, described Wednesday's incident as \"deeply tragic\". He noted the timing ahead of Thanksgiving, and amid a \"highly charged political environment in Washington DC\".But he highlighted that the shooting was an \"individual criminal offence, not representative of a community\".\"Afghans in the United States are hardworking, tax paying members of society,\" he added. \"They remain grateful to America for the evacuation efforts during the crisis in Kabul.\"Thousands of Afghans scrambled to escape the country in 2021, many via Kabul, as the US withdrew its troops and the Taliban swept in. The suspect, Mr Lakanwal, is said by US officials to have had a relationship with US forces in Afghanistan while they were stationed there. He helped guard US forces at Kabul airport at the time of the withdrawal, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC.He came to the US the same year.

    "body": "Zambia's parliament has declared vacant the seat held by the daughter of the late ex-President Edgar Lungu, because of her continued absence in the wake of his death.Until her dismissal, Tasila Lungu had been the MP for Chawama constituency in the capital, Lusaka, representing the opposition Patriotic Front.In a message to her voters, she hinted she may try and challenge the decision saying: \"Where there is a will there is a way\".Her father died in June at the age of 68 in South Africa, where he was seeking medical treatment. This sparked a bitter legal row with his successor, President Hakainde Hichilema, who wanted to repatriate the body for a state funeral against the family's wishes.Ms Lungu has been attending court in South Africa challenging an earlier ruling in August that sided with Hichilema's government.The government had successfully argued in a Pretoria court that Hichilema must be able to attend the funeral because he is the head of state. Yet the Lungu family says the deceased gave instructions that the president \"should not be anywhere near\" his body.The former president's remains are still in South Africa as the impasse continues.Calls for her to lose her parliamentary seat first came from the ruling United Party for National Development. Brian Kambita MP questioned the speaker in July about whether Ms Lungu was still qualified to hold office because of her prolonged absence.Speaker Nelly Mutti initially granted Ms Lungu 14 days of compassionate leave to mourn her father and return to parliament when it resumed in September.However, she did not return within the given time.Parliament wrote to Ms Lungu again, but instead of resuming her duties, she requested more time until the court case over the burial was resolved.She also asked to be allowed to attend parliamentary sessions virtually.The matter was referred to the parliamentary committee on privileges and absences, which invited Ms Lungu to appear on 18 November. She did not attend that meeting either.The committee later suggested allowing her to represent her Chawama constituency online until her father's burial arrangements were concluded.But Ms Mutti rejected that proposal, saying virtual attendance could not replace physical representation.In a Facebook statement to her constituents on Friday, Ms Lungu thanked her \"wonderful team of councillors, community members and constituency staff who continue to coordinate and work tirelessly to serve you\".Elections for the seat are expected to be held within 90 days, despite Zambia holding a general election next August.The decision to declare Ms Lungu's vacant has been received with mixed feelings - some argue that she should be allowed the time to mourn her father, while others say her constituents have been deprived of representation.Independent MP Binwell Mpundu has accused the government of hypocrisy, saying it was wrong for them to claim solidarity with the Lungu family.\"You dragged [them] to court and today you nullify the parliamentary seat for the daughter who is mourning the late father. Hypocrites.\"",

    "body": "Quebec expands secularism law and limits public prayer24 hours agoJessica MurphyTorontoBloomberg via Getty ImagesQuebec Premier Francois Legault's government has passed a number of secularism laws in the Canadian provinceThe Canadian province of Quebec plans to impose restrictions on public prayer and limit the exclusive offering of religion-based menus, like kosher and halal meals, in public institutions.The latest efforts to strengthen state secularism, dubbed \"secularism 2.0\", are part of a new bill introduced by the governing Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) on Thursday, expanding on a 2019 religious symbols law that has fuelled fierce debate throughout the country. The original law prevents judges, police officers, teachers and public servants from wearing symbols such as the kippah, turban or hijab while at work.Canada's Supreme Court will hear a legal challenge of that law early next year. Jean-François Roberge, the minister responsible for secularism, told a news conference in French on Thursday that the bill was \"part of an approach that respected individual as well as collective rights\". The measures proposed in Bill 9 would: extend the ban on wearing religious symbols to staff in subsidised daycares bar \"collective religious practices\" like prayer in public spaces, such as parks, without prior authorisation from municipalitiesprevent students and staff from wearing face coverings in daycare all the way through to post-secondary educationRoberge said the limits on public prayer were in reaction to recent protests in the province, where there has been debate over groups praying at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. \"It's shocking to see people blocking traffic, taking possession of the public space without a permit, without warning, and then turning our streets, our parks, our public squares into places of worship,\" he said. The decision to strengthen the law has already faced criticism from the opposition Parti Québecois, which earlier this week accused the CAQ of creating division in an attempt to bolster support ahead of next year's provincial election. The National Council of Canadian Muslims also criticised the bill, accusing the CAQ of \"doubling down on identity politics and division in a desperate attempt to regain the public's trust\". Since Bill 21 was passed six years ago, the issue of secularism has continued to simmer in Quebec. Last year, 11 teachers - primarily of North African descent - at a Montreal elementary school were suspended after a government report said they had created a toxic environment for students and staff, and largely avoided certain subjects like science and sex education.Quebec Premier Francois Legault said the teachers had tried to introduce \"Islamist\" beliefs and vowed to strengthen secularism measures in schools.In August, a government-mandated committee released a report with recommendations including a ban on religious symbols for daycare workers and the phasing out of public funding for private religious schools.And last month, the Legault government passed a law extending secularism rules to staff who interact with students in public primary and high schools, and barring students from wearing face coverings. NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA sign for the federal Bloc Québécois that reads in French \"I choose secularism\"What is Quebec's secularism law?Bill 21 prohibits public officials in positions of authority - such as judges, police officers, teachers and public servants  - from wearing religious symbols such as the kippah, turban or hijab while at work.It also requires public services to be provided and received with the face uncovered.For Bill 21, the Quebec government invoked the \"notwithstanding clause\" - a part of the Canadian constitution that allows government to override \"fundamental freedoms\" of religion, expression, and association, as well as the right to life, liberty and security of the person, and freedom from discrimination. It essentially serves an opt-out that prevents courts from striking down the legislation on constitutional grounds.Bill 21 does not mention any specific religion and would include symbols worn by a person of any faith, including Christians, and affirms the religious neutrality of the province.But critics argue it targets mostly religious minorities, especially women of Muslim faith. The law has faced a number of legal challenges in Quebec. Canada's Supreme Court has now agreed to take up the case, which will hinge both on the law itself and the use of the notwithstanding clause. The debate over secularism - broadly, the principle that religion and government institutions should be separate - has played a significant role in the province's public discourse for almost two decades. Known in the majority French-speaking province as laïcité, it has been an important value in Quebec society since the 1960s as the Catholic Church's strong influence began to wane in the province.  A September survey by polling firm Leger, commissioned by media outlets Le Journal de Montréal and TVA, indicated that 68% of respondents thought secularism was an important value. Similar legislation to Bill 21 is in place in various countries across the EU.France passed a ban on veils, crosses and other religious symbols in schools in 2004 and on face covering in public spaces in 2010.

    "body": "Pope Leo on first foreign trip says future of humanity at stake from conflict1 day agoAleem MaqboolReligion editor, travelling with Pope Leo XIVAnadolu via Getty ImagesPope Leo (C) was welcomed to Ankara by Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip ErdoganPope Leo XIV has warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", at the start of his foreign trip in Turkey.\"The future of humanity is at stake, said the Pope, urging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to act as a source of stability because of the need to promote dialogue and stability.The Pope will mark a historic Christian anniversary during his visit to Turkey, before heading to Lebanon days after Israeli airstrikes on its capital, Beirut.The visits had been planned by late Pope Francis, but their main theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.Leo warned that today's wars were like a \"third world war fought piecemeal\", repeating a phrase that his predecessor had himself used several times, referring to conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, Myanmar and elsewhere. Since he became pontiff six months ago, he has conveyed a sense of being extremely measured, even cautious. But on this trip, his powers of diplomacy will be closely scrutinised.A key moment of the trip will take place in the Turkish town of Iznik, the site of the ancient city of Nicaea. Pope Leo and leaders of other Christian traditions will gather to mark the anniversary of an ancient council that took place there 1,700 years ago.  In 325 AD, among other key decisions, more than 200 bishops at the council affirmed the belief that Jesus was the son of God, eventually leading to what is known as the Nicene Creed.Eastern and Western branches of Christianity later dramatically split, but during this trip there will be messages of togetherness and healing divisions.In Turkey the Pope will also visit the Blue Mosque, as both his immediate predecessors Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI had done. He will have meetings with other religious leaders in a gesture of inter-religious dialogue before flying on to the second leg of the trip.EPAThe Pope plans to visit the Blue Mosque in IstanbulThe Vatican says plans for the Pope's visit to Lebanon have not changed following the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut earlier in the week.He will meet more faith leaders and hear from young people in Lebanon, his visit giving a boost in particular to the estimated third of the country that is Christian.On the final day of the trip, Pope Leo will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.Over recent months, though he has spoken out on some issues dear to him such as the dignity of migrants, he has certainly not been as overtly political as his predecessor could be.He has walked such a fine line that in some cases both progressives and traditionalists within the Catholic Church have made the case that he supports their school of thought.It was for similar reasons that cardinals of different persuasions were thought to have coalesced around him at conclave.Pope Francis was seen as a visionary but one who was not overly worried about creating consensus, leaving behind a somewhat divided Church. Pope Leo has so far operated very differently, gently holding on to some of the progressive ideals of his predecessor while paying heed to the views of traditionalists.He has repeatedly called for an end to war, but in a different way to Pope Francis, who memorably made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza to offer his support.ReutersThe Pope met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Presidential Palace in Ankara on ThursdayIn meetings on this trip - with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Lebanese civic leaders - Pope Leo may be drawn to comment on his views on conflict in the region.We may hear something of his impressions at the end of his trip, as it is customary for the Pope to hold a news conference with travelling press on the return flight to Rome.What we will hear more of on this trip is a pope speaking in a Chicagoan accent. Although Pope Leo, who speaks several languages fluently, has mainly given public addresses in Italian up to this point, the Vatican has confirmed that he will speak English throughout the Turkish leg of his trip, with some French too during his time in Lebanon.",

    "body": "Eight more arrested over fire in Hong Kong that killed at least 128 people5 hours agoHafsa Khalil'Solemn scenes': BBC reports from outside Hong Kong's scorched buildingsAt least 128 people are now known to have died in a devastating fire that engulfed multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong.Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovation works the blocks had been undergoing before the fire. Three others were detained earlier on manslaughter charges.The cause of the fire remains unclear, though officials said that polystyrene and protective netting placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its spread.A further 79 people were injured in the blaze - the city's deadliest in more than 70 years. Dozens remain missing.Police went into the buildings to start gathering evidence, after authorities said that an investigation would take place over the next three to four weeks.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said that those arrested in the corruption probe on Friday included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors. Some 2,311 firefighters worked to bring the fire under control after it spread across seven of Wang Fuk Court's eight apartment blocks. Firefighting efforts have now ceased. The fire was fully extinguished by 10:18 local time (02:18 GMT) on Friday, the fire department said at a news conference.It also said 89 bodies have yet to be identified, and 16 bodies remain inside the buildings.Meanwhile, crowds have been gathering at a nearby community hall that has been opened to families looking for missing loved ones. Relatives are being asked to help with the identification process by bringing in family photos.The Hong Kong government has also set up shelters and support centres for displaced residents. Groups of volunteers have been packing and organising supplies for those affected, including clothing and hygiene products.The blaze started at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, and by 18:22 local time it had been upgraded to the most serious category by fire officials.The fire department said the fire started at a lower level before moving upwards, and reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F).As a result, the blaze reignited in some places after being doused, they said.One former resident, who moved out earlier this year and only gave his surname, told the BBC: \"There was nothing we could do. Together we watched our homes burn gradually.\"The fire spread quickly across the separate blocks due to the presence of flammable netting and other materials on the outside of the buildings.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.Twelve other firefighters have also been injured, authorities said.Two Indonesian nationals who had been working on the buildings were also killed in the fire, a migrant charity said. Indonesian and Filipino workers are among those still unaccounted for.Indonesian worker Fita had been inside the building with her employer when she heard the fire brigade siren. She described it as scary and confusing, but added that she felt \"so grateful\" to be safe.\"But I'm concerned about friends I know... Usually we talk, and then I haven't met them [since the fire],\" she told news agency Reuters.Many of those in the shelters have been unwilling to speak to the media while reeling from the trauma.Shock has quickly shifted to anger in Hong Kong, as questions grow on who should be held accountable for the blaze.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.Meanwhile, one resident told the BBC that some of the alarms had been turned off by construction workers.Reports of residents' prior complaints over high renovation fees and whether the materials used complied with fire-safety regulations have also resurfaced and are circulating widely online. \"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" a police spokesperson said.ReutersReutersAs firefighters bring the blaze under control, the extent of the damage is yet to be assessedThick smoke billowed into the sky as bystanders watched onWang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse.Additional reporting by Martin Yip and Gemini Cheng in Hong Kong",

    "body": "Zelensky's top adviser resigns after Ukrainian anti-corruption raid on his home2 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor andJaroslav LukivReutersYermak has for years been Zelensky's closest aide and has played a key role in talks towards ending the warUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Yermak, a towering figure with enormous political influence, has been Zelensky's closest adviser throughout Russia's full-scale war, but has come under increasing pressure over an escalating scandal - even though he is not accused of any wrongdoing.Zelensky had recently appointed him to head crucial negotiations, with US President Donald Trump leading a new drive to end the Russia-Ukraine war.In a stark address to the nation outside his presidential office, Zelensky called for unity, warning: \"We risk losing everything: ourselves, Ukraine, our future.\"The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine for weeks, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position with the US at a delicate time.Ukraine, backed by its European allies, has sought to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Early on Friday Ukraine's two anti-corruption agencies raided Yermak's apartment in Kyiv's government quarters and the chief of staff said on social media that \"from my side there is full co-operation\".\"I'm grateful to Andriy that Ukraine's position on the negotiating track was always presented as required: it was always a patriotic position,\" Ukraine's president said during his video address in Kyiv.Zelensky said he would start consultations on Saturday on who would replace Yermak as his top adviser: \"When all the attention is focused on diplomacy and the defence in a war, inner strength is required.\"\"Russia wants Ukraine to make mistakes – there won't be any mistakes from our side. Our work continues, our fight continues. We have no right... to retreat, to quarrel [among ourselves].\"Yermak's departure from Ukraine's leading circle will come as a major blow for Zelensky, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as part of Trump's draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week and Russia's Vladimir Putin said on Friday he backed a Hungarian offer to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest.Putin has continued to promote Russia's maximalist demands to bring an end to the war. He claimed on Thursday that Russian forces had the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from the entire eastern Donbas region, including several strategically important cities under Ukrainian control.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Putin said.Hours before the raid on his flat, Yermak continued to explain his government's position as it comes under US pressure to make territorial concessions to Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\"As long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory,\" Yermak told The Atlantic website.Yermak, 54, admitted during his interview he was under \"enormous\" pressure to stand down, adding \"the case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\".AFP via Getty ImagesEarlier this week, Yermak took part in talks in Geneva with US Secretary of State Marco RubioUkraine's anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) did not explain why they searched his flat.In the past few weeks investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.Russian officials involved in Trump's draft peace plan have talked up the corruption claims, which have alarmed European Union allies. Ukraine is a candidate to join the EU and a report earlier this month highlighted doubts over \"commitment to its anti-corruption agenda\".Earlier this year Zelensky sought to curb the powers of the two anti-corruption agencies, but he was forced to backtrack almost immediately after widespread protests and objections from Kyiv's Western allies.Zelensky has already fired Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and several suspects have been detained in the burgeoning corruption scandal that has outraged public opinion because of allegations that money was diverted from key infrastructure projects vital for safeguarding Ukrainian power supplies.As winter starts in Ukraine, Russian attacks have already badly damaged its energy infrastructure and Ukrainians across the country have had to cope with only a few hours of electricity a day.One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has left the country in the wake of the corruption allegations.Mindich was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.In recent weeks Andriy Yermak's popularity has nose-dived and MPs from all parties, including his own, have been calling for his sacking, initially for what they saw as his inflated power for an unelected official, but more recently, the burgeoning corruption scandal.Recent polling suggested 70% of the public wanted him to resign.Zelensky and his now-former chief of staff became friends about 14 years ago, while the future president was a senior media executive and Yermak worked for him as a lawyer. Yermak was made chief of staff a year after Zelensky was elected president in 2019.On the first night of Russia's invasion, they appeared together with colleagues delivering a defiant video message outside the presidential office on Kyiv's Bankova Street, vowing to stay and fight.\"We are all here,\" Zelensky told Ukrainians. \"Our soldiers are here, the citizens are here and we are all here. We are defending our independence, and that's how it will continue.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoAna FaguyWashingtonWatch: How the shooting of two National Guard members unfoldedTwo members of the National Guard were shot and seriously wounded on Wednesday just blocks from the White House in Washington DC. One died on Thursday while the second remains in a critical condition, US President Donald Trump said the following day. The suspect, an Afghan national, is in custody. In response to the attack, Trump said he would deploy another 500 troops to the streets of the nation's capital. What happened in the shooting near the White House?Just after 14:00 EST (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday, two members of the National Guard, both from West Virginia, were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown Washington DC. The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets, an area where many office workers mill around at lunchtime. Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect \"came around the corner\" and \"immediately started firing\", adding that the soldiers had been \"ambushed\".Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington DC, said the incident was a targeted attack. The location of the shooting, just blocks from the White House, meant a number of law enforcement officials were quickly on the scene to treat the two victims and apprehend the gunman. The guard members were taken to hospital, where one later died. Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday and not at the White House at the time.Patel: National Guard members 'brazenly attacked' and in critical conditionWhat do we know about the victims?The victims have been named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24 - both uniformed members of the West Virginia National Guard. Ms Beckstrom died on Thursday, Trump said while on a Thanksgiving call with US service members.He said Mr Wolfe remains in critical condition after being shot multiple times. ReutersAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that Ms Beckstrom had volunteered to work in the nation's capital over the Thanksgiving holiday.\"She volunteered, as did many of those guardsmen and women, so other people could be home with their families,\" she said.What do we know about the suspect?The Department of Homeland Security named the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, and described him as \"a criminal alien from Afghanistan\".During his apprehension, the suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.ReutersMr Lakanwal is 29 years old and not co-operating with authorities, officials said.He is said to have come to the US in 2021. He lived with his wife and five children on the other side of the country, in the state of Washington.How did he come to the US?Mr Lakanwal reportedly came to the US in September 2021, under a programme for Afghans named Operation Allies Welcome that existed during the presidency of Joe Biden. This was during the time period that followed a chaotic withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. As the Taliban took back control of the country, there were fears of retribution against those who had co-operated with the US.The Congressional Research Service has estimated that around 77,000 Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections, in place for about a year following the US withdrawal.Mr Lakanwal had a relationship in Afghanistan with the US forces, FBI Director Kash Patel said. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said he had worked with the intelligence agency.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told CBS. What will he be charged with? The US attorney for Washington DC, Jeanine Pirro, said the initial charges of assault against the suspect will be upgraded to murder in the first degree.Initially, the administration had announced that Mr Lakanwal would be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, along with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. \"It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn't know what was coming,\" Pirro told Fox and Friends on Friday. \"And that is the homicide, and that is the murder that we're looking at right now.\"Watch: Police chief describes how shooting of National Guard members unfoldedHow has the Trump administration responded?Just hours after the shooting, Trump posted a video speaking from Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. He described the shooting as an \"act of terror\" and \"a crime against humanity\". Trump said he would deploy an additional 500 National Guardsmen to Washington DC - where there are currently nearly 2,200 troops.National Guard troops are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.Trump deployed troops in August to tackle what he called \"out of control\" crime in the nation's capital.Overall crime in the nation's capital has fallen since the force was sent, which Trump credits to the troops' presence on the streets.The Trump administration has also highlighted the suspect's background, and announced a range of measures aimed at toughening the US approach to migration from Afghanistan and other nations.The day of the shooting, it suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans.The next day, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it would re-examine green cards [permanent US residence cards] issued to individuals who migrated to the US from 19 countries.And Trump went on to say he would \"permanently pause migration\" to the US from all \"third-world countries\" - using a term that was used in the past to describe poorer, developing nations.",

    "body": "'This was preventable': Anger and unanswered questions after Hong Kong fire12 hours agoKoh EweandKelly NgVideo shows how fast fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseShock is giving way to anger in Hong Kong after a massive fire ripped through a densely populated subsidised housing estate on Wednesday, killing at least 128 people and critically injuring dozens.Authorities say substandard mesh and plastic sheets on the buildings' windows may have spread the blaze, which raged for more than a day.Firefighting operations have now ended, with dozens of residents still unaccounted for.Questions are mounting as to how the fire at Wang Fuk Court spread so rapidly and who is responsible, with many calling it a \"man-made disaster\".Three people in charge of renovating the blocks are under arrest for manslaughter, and authorities have launched a corruption inquiry.A post that has gone viral on social media in the wake of the blaze reads: \"It's not an accident.\"Several residents have revealed in interviews that the fire alarm did not sound when the fire broke out. Authorities said on Friday that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working properly. Kiko Ma, who owns an apartment at Wang Fuk Court, says the alarms had been turned off amid renovation works, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to get in and out of the building. Ms Ma lives in Canada with her family, but visits the Hong Kong apartment several times a year.\"This was preventable... A lot of people did not do their duties,\" the 33-year-old tells the BBC, claiming that the renovation firm used \"poor quality, flammable materials\".Residents often saw construction workers smoking and found cigarette butts along their window ledges, she adds.\"People kept asking what would happen if there was a fire. Everyone was very worried about this.\"Getty ImagesThe blaze spread rapidly and went on for more than a day in some blocksThis is Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years - already having surpassed the toll of the August 1962 inferno in the Sham Shui Po neighbourhood, which killed 44 people and displaced hundreds.Built in the 1980s, Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's north-eastern Tai Po district comprises eight 31-storey buildings, seven of which went up in flames. The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.Police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards. In a presser on Friday they attributed the rapid spread of the fire to styrofoam blocks placed outside the windows of the apartments, apparently to \"protect\" them from the debris and dust.Some experts also believe the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks helped fuel the inferno. Such scaffolding is an iconic sight across Hong Kong, and widely used in construction.Earlier this year, authorities announced plans to phase out bamboo in favour of sturdier, fire-resistant steel, citing bamboo's combustibility and deterioration over time.Getty ImagesHundreds of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters while emergency housing units are being allocated to someResidents at Wang Fuk Court had expressed unease about renovation plans when they were announced last year. Reports of those concerns have now resurfaced online, sparking accusations around a lack of transparency.Another homeowner who was abroad when the fire broke out said the plans were \"fundamentally shady\". \"[Those in charge] used small favours to encourage unsuspecting elderly residents to support their plans,\" they wrote in a comment on Instagram.Mr Lai, a sales associate who the BBC agreed to refer to by his last name only, says Wang Fuk Court residents had earlier questioned the high cost of renovation works. Calls from some residents to re-elect the estate's management committee went unheeded, he added. This week's fire is not an isolated incident, Mr Lai said, claiming that construction companies \"often prioritise cost efficiency\" over safety. He noted that a building in Hong Kong's Central district went up in flames last month after its bamboo scaffolding caught fire.\"When similar incidents happen, they raise the question of whether [there are] systemic weaknesses.\"Hong Kong authorities on Thursday ordered inspections of all housing estates undergoing \"major repairs\" to check for the \"safety of scaffolding and building materials\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterTicket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday.From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery.The museum's security and management have faced criticism since a brazen heist in October, when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes.An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure.From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum.Non-EU visitors in groups with accredited guides will also have to pay €28 starting next year, the Louvre told the BBC.The price hike is expected to raise between €15m and €20m each year to support the museum's modernisation plans, it added.The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum.There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues.In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026.Macron also said the Mona Lisa would be moved to a new space to deal with overcrowding.Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo.The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros.Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics due to structural concerns.The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration.",

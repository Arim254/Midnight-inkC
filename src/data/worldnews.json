    "body": "1 hour agoCachella SmithWatch: The bride and groom are cheered and showered with confettiAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has married his partner Jodie Haydon, becoming the country's first leader to marry while in office.The pair tied the knot in the capital, Canberra, on Saturday afternoon local time - the day after the final sitting of the parliamentary year. \"We are absolutely delighted to share our love and commitment to spending our future lives together, in front of our family and closest friends,\" Albanese said in a brief statement.The couple became engaged on Valentine's Day last year. The Labor leader's proposal and the wedding reception both took place at his official residence, The Lodge.ReutersUntil the big day, the wedding plans had been kept under wraps due to concerns about security and potential disruptions.In attendance were Ms Haydon's parents as well as Albanese's son from his previous marriage.Albanese's dog Toto acted as ring bearer while the couple walked back down the aisle to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\".The prime minister also shared a video on his official social media accounts showing the happy couple walking down the aisle as guests showered them in confetti. Several of Albanese's cabinet ministers attended the ceremony. ReutersAt the reception, their first dance was to The Way You Look Tonight by Frank Sinatra.The celebrations also featured custom-made beer cans printed with the image used to announce their engagement.The couple are set to honeymoon in Australia from Monday and Friday next week - plans that were pared back after his re-election in May.Albanese, 62, and Ms Haydon, 47, first met at a business dinner in Melbourne in 2020, while the former was leader of the opposition.ReutersMs Haydon appeared during Albanese's 2022 and 2025 election campaigns, and was seen alongside the PM at major events, including the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and a state dinner hosted by former US President Joe Biden.Albanese also made Australian history by becoming the first prime minister to get engaged while in office.The couple said in a joint statement at the time that they were \"so lucky to have found each other\".",

    "body": "A Tunisian court has handed jail terms to dozens of opposition leaders, lawyers and businessmen accused of attempting to overthrow the nation's president.Forty people including opposition leader Jawahar Ben Mbarek were handed sentences ranging from four to 45 years over the alleged conspiracy to oust President Kais Saied.Twenty of those charged have fled abroad and were sentenced in absentia, while others have been held in detention since 2023.Human rights groups have criticised the trial as politically motivated, characterising the prosecutions as an escalation of Saied's crackdown on dissent since he suspended Tunisia's parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree.Tunisian authorities argue the defendants, who include former head of intelligence Kamel Guizani, attemtpted to destabilise the country and topple Saied. Ben Mbarek and party leaders Issam Chebbi and Ghazi Chaouachi received jail terms of 20 years. All three have been detained since the 2023 crackdown.The maximum sentence, 45 years, was given to businessman Kamel Ltaif, while opposition politician Khyam Turki received a 35-year term.Ben Mbarek has been on hunger strike for over a month and was at risk of dying, news agency AFP reports, citing his sister and lawyer Dalila Ben Mbarek.Among those sentenced in absentia was politician and feminist Bochra Belhaj Hmida, as well as French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, human rights groups say.The final sentences were issued by an appeals court after the opposition figures were initially sentenced in April. Saied had branded them \"terrorists\".A lawyer for the defendants was quoted by Reuters as describing the trial as a \"farce\" that had the \"clear intent to eliminate political opponents\".Human rights groups have also been critical of the prosecutions.Sara Hashash, deputy regional director at Amnesty International, described the sentences as \"unjust\" and \"an appalling indictment of the Tunisian justice system\".She said that while three defendants were acquitted by the appeals court, it had increased others' sentences.\"The Court of Appeal has thereby also rubber stamped the government's use of the justice system to eliminate political dissent.\"After the initial ruling in April, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said the trial had raised \"serious concerns about political motivations\", and urged the Tunisian government to \"refrain from using broad national security and counter terrorism legislation to silence dissent\".On Saturday, thousands of Tunisians marched through the capital, Tunis, in an anti-government protest, accusing Saied of cementing a one-man rule through the judiciary and police.Saied was elected in 2019 after Tunisia emerged from the Arab Spring democracy movement.But the north African nation has since seen democratic backsliding and the re-imposition of aspects of authoritarian rule.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. The US president said Hernández had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly\" in a social media post announcing the move on Friday.Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.Trump also threw his support behind conservative presidential candidate Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura in the Central American nation's general election, due to be held on Sunday.Hernández, a member of the National Party, who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the US in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to smuggle hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. He was convicted by a New York jury two years later. Polls indicate the Honduran election remains a toss-up between three candidates including Asfura, the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and leader of the conservative National Party.Also in the running is Rixi Moncada, a former defence minister standing for the ruling left-wing Libre Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla on Friday, writing that the latter was \"a boderline Communist\" who was only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.He characterised Asfura as \"standing up for democracy\" and praised him for campaigning against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, with whom Trump has engaged in a war of words in recent months.Nasralla has pledged to cut ties with Venezuela if he wins.The Trump administration has accused the left-wing Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as illegitimate by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.It used countering drug trafficking as a justification for a military build-up in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on vessels it says have been used for smuggling - though some analysts have described these moves as a means of pressuring Latin American leaders.Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a co-operative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with it. Her country also hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on vessels suspected of being involved in the transport of narcotics since they began in August.US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" was to eliminate \"narcoterrorists\". But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "Senegal's prime minister and Nigeria's former president have both said they believe the ousting of Guinea-Bissau's president this week was staged.Umaro Sissoco Embaló's apparent removal by the military on Wednesday came a day before authorities were due to announce election results. The military has since suspended the electoral process and blocked the release of the results, insisting it thwarted a plot to destabilise the politically unstable country.Senegal's PM Ousmane Sonko and Nigeria's ex-leader Goodluck Jonathan did not provide evidence to support their claim that the coup was fabricated. Embaló has previously faced accusations of using crises to quash dissent.Some local civil society groups have accused Embaló of masterminding a \"simulated coup\" against himself with the help of the military, saying it was a ruse to block election results from coming out in case he lost.Embaló has not responded to the allegations.The 53-year-old former president arrived in neighbouring Senegal on a chartered military flight late on Thursday following his release by the military forces who toppled his government.Nigeria's Jonathan, who led a team of election observers from the West African Elders Forum to Guinea-Bissau, said the incident \"was not a coup\".He described it as a \"ceremonial coup\", questioning the events that preceded it and why it was Embaló who first announced his own overthrow. The latter phoned French TV station France 24 and said: \"I have been deposed.\"Jonathan contrasted this with how other leaders in the region were ousted in recent coups.Meanwhile, Senegal's Sonko told lawmakers that \"what happened in Guinea-Bissau was a sham\".Both men have demanded the results of the presidential election be released.Their statements add to opposition claims in Guinea-Bissau that the coup was contrived, though no-one has so far presented evidence to support this.Embaló has said he has survived multiple coup attempts during his time in office - though critics have previously accused him of fabricating crises in order to crack down on dissent.He dissolved Guinea-Bissau's parliament after one attempted coup in December 2023 and the country has not had a sitting legislature since then.On Friday, Guinea-Bissau's transitional leader Gen Horta N'Tam appointed Ilidio Vieira Té, previously the finance minister, as the new prime minister.Additionally, the African Union suspended Guinea-Bissau's membership on Friday because of the unconstitutional military takeover, AFP reports. The West African bloc Ecowas took a similar action, while urging the military to return to the barracks.Guinea-Bissau is a coup-prone West African nation which is also strained by drug trafficking. The military said they were taking power to thwart a plot by unnamed politicians who had \"the support of a well-known drug baron\" to destabilise the country.A mother of three told the BBC that it was not the first military takeover she had lived through, but had nonetheless come as a surprise as people were expecting to hear about the outcome of the election, which had an estimated voter turnout of more than 65%.\"We heard gunfire. We ran away. We tried to pack our bags to go home,\" she said.Another resident of the capital, Bissau, said he was unhappy about the situation.\"This doesn't help anyone because it puts the country into chaos,\" Mohamed Sylla told the BBC.But reactions have been mixed, with some residents praising the army and hoping for an orderly transition.\"I am not against the military regime as long as they improve the living conditions in the country,\" Suncar Gassama told the BBC.",

    "body": "Three days of mourning begin after Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades5 hours agoTabby WilsonHong Kong officials mark beginning of official mourning period with moment of silenceHong Kong officials have held a moment of silence at the start of a three-day mourning period to remember those killed after the city's deadliest fire in nearly 80 years.At least 128 people are now known to have died in the fire, which engulfed seven tower blocks on Wednesday. A further 79 were injured and dozens remain unaccounted for.Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovation works the blocks had been undergoing. Three others were detained earlier on manslaughter charges.The cause of the fire has yet to be determined, but officials have said it spread up and between the blocks rapidly because of flammable materials placed on their exterior.Saturday morning's ceremony was held outside government headquarters, and saw city leader John Lee joined by other Hong Kong officials to observe three minutes of silence.The flags of China and Hong Kong were flown at half mast. The government has also set up memorial points across the city, where the public can pay their respects and sign condolence books.Once the fire started, it spread quickly to seven of the eight towers in Wang Fuk Court, in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po distric.It then took more than 2,000 firefighters almost two days to bring the blaze under control.The cause of the fire remains unclear, though authorities have said that polystyrene placed on the outside of the windows and plastic netting around the scaffolding on the buildings facilitated its spread.The tower blocks were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction and renovation work in Hong Kong. The fire has sparked a debate on whether it should still be used.ReutersOfficials have confirmed that an investigation will be taking place over the next few weeks, with police already gathering evidence from the scene.The fire has caused anger throughout Hong Kong - which is known for its high-rise buildings - as questions about who should be held accountable grow.Residents of Wang Fuk Court have reported broken fire alarms and negligence from the company carrying out the renovations on the Wang Fuk Court, while Hong Kong's fire service has said fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) said those arrested in the corruption probe on Friday included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors.Hong Kong's Labour and Welfare Secretary, Chris Sun, told reporters that his department had made 16 checks on the works at Wang Fuk Court since July last year.The housing estate was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.",

    "body": "Runaway nuns can stay in Alpine convent if they leave social media18 hours agoBethany BellIn ViennaBethany Bell/BBCSister Rita (L),  Sister Regina (C) and Sister Bernadette have gained a substantial following for their social media postsThree Austrian nuns in their 80s who ran away from the old people's home where they were placed have been told they can stay in their former convent \"until further notice\".However, Church authorities say they can only stay if they stop posting on social media.Sister Bernadette, 88, Sister Regina, 86, and Sister Rita, 82, are the last nuns at the Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen, near Salzburg.In a statement released in their name, they said they were willing to reach an agreement in principle but their legitimate claims and needs would have to be taken seriously.They indicated they were not entirely happy with the Church's offer, saying it had the \"character of a gagging contract\".The three nuns say they were taken out of the convent against their will in December 2023.In September, they moved back in with the help of former students and a locksmith, angering Church officials.The nuns' superior, Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey, called on them to return to the care home, saying their decision to return to the convent was \"completely incomprehensible\".The nuns' story sparked worldwide interest. Supporters helped them with food, electricity and social media, posting videos of the nuns' daily lives.These feature the nuns at prayer or at lunch, and include Sister Rita's exercise workouts. She was recently given a pair of boxing gloves.The Goldenstein nuns have amassed almost 100,000 followers on Instagram and several thousand on Facebook.Now after almost three months of standoff, a spokesman for the Provost, Harald Schiffl, has told Austrian Press Agency APA that the nuns can stay for now.It follows a meeting earlier this week, where a proposed solution to the standoff was suggested.The nuns could stay at the Kloster Goldenstein, Harald Schiffl told APA, but only under certain conditions. These include giving up their social media activities.Church officials also want the nuns to ensure that the enclosed part of the convent will no longer be accessible to people who do not belong to the order.In return, they will be allowed to stay and be provided with medical care and spiritual support from a priest.BBC/Bethany BellThe three nuns have lived in Schloss Goldenstein for decades\"Now it's up to the sisters,\" Harald Schiffl told APA.According to the statement released on Friday, the three sisters would have no future recourse to advice from lawyers and the requirement for them and their helpers to cease their social media activity had \"no legal basis and... would deprive the sisters of their only remaining protection from the interested public\".The three nuns have spent much of their lives at Schloss Goldenstein, a castle which has been a convent and a private girls' school since 1877. The school, which started accepting boys in 2017, is still functioning.Sister Bernadette attended the school herself, arriving as a teenager in 1948. One of her fellow students was Austrian actress Romy Schneider, one of the world's biggest film stars of the 1960s and 70s.Sister Regina arrived at the convent in 1958 and Sister Rita in 1962.All three nuns went on to work at the school as teachers for many years. Sister Regina was headmistress.But the numbers of nuns dwindled. In 2022, the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the Reicherberg Abbey, an Augustinian monastery. Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey became the nuns' superior and the community was officially dissolved at the beginning of 2024.The remaining nuns were granted lifelong right of residence, as long as their health and mental capacity allowed.In December 2023, the decision was made to transfer them to a Catholic care home, where they felt unhappy.At the beginning of September, Sister Bernadette, Sister Rita and Sister Regina moved back, helped by a group of former students.The nuns told the BBC at the time that they were determined to stay.\"Before I die in that old people's home, I would rather go to a meadow and enter eternity that way,\" said Sister Bernadette.",

    "body": "16 hours agoNick Thorpe,Budapest correspondentandPatrick JacksonHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, days before Russia holds talks on a US push to end the war in Ukraine.Orban is seen as one of Putin's closest allies in Europe and he has consistently angered his Nato and EU allies by undermining solidarity against Russia.\"We are aware of your balanced position on the situation in Ukraine,\" Putin told Orban in remarks carried by Russian state TV.Posting later on social media, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the Hungarians had got what they came to Moscow for: guaranteed supplies of Russian oil and gas, and agreement to continue the construction of the Paks nuclear power station.Reacting to news of Orban's visit, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, the EU's biggest member state, told reporters: \"He is acting without a European mandate and he is doing so without consulting us but that is nothing new.\"Referring to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Merz said of Orban: \"He has his own ideas about ending this war. So far, they have not been realised. If someone has a better idea than us, then that is very welcome. Unfortunately I just doubt that this time will be more successful than last time.\"Putin thanked the Hungarian prime minister for proposing Budapest as a potential venue for a Russia-US summit with President Donald Trump. \"Trump immediately said: ''We have good relations with Hungary, you have good relations with Viktor, and I do too, so I suggest this option.' Of course, we happily agreed,\" Putin said.According to Reuters news agency, Orban told Putin that Hungary was \"interested in peace\" and added: \"Our meetings today give me the  opportunity to confirm, Mr President, that Hungary is ready to provide a platform for such negotiations.\"However, the atmosphere when the delegations met in Moscow appeared surprisingly frosty and at one point Orban inadvertently bumped into his Russian host, after shaking hands with other members of the Russian delegation. One independent Hungarian media outlet also suggested that Putin's words had been mistranslated into Hungarian, to sound more positive.Plans for a Budapest \"peace summit\" were proposed last month but they were shelved, reportedly because the Russian side had refused to compromise on Putin's maximalist demands for an end to the war.The Hungarian leader's Fidesz party faces parliamentary elections in April and polls suggest that for the first time in 15 years it could be defeated at the ballot box. If he were to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, it could help boost his chances of re-election.Orban, who last visited Moscow in July 2024, has repeatedly challenged EU attempts to end European imports of Russian oil and gas.He billed Friday's visit as the second leg of a strategy to ensure Russian energy supplies this winter, for Slovakia and Serbia as well as Hungary.Earlier this month in Washington, he secured exemption from US sanctions on Russian fuel - but only as long as he remains in power.Ever since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Orban has claimed to have been on the side of peace and told Hungarian state radio last week that \"Europe has decided to go to war in Ukraine\".He has strongly backed Trump's 28-point peace plan to end the war and during frantic diplomacy after it emerged, the Orban government and pro-Orban media have accused EU leaders of \"war-mongering\" for trying to adapt the plan to take account of Ukraine's objections.Joining Orban and Putin in the Kremlin were leading Russian officials, including Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, who is part of Russia's negotiating team with the US.In a letter this week to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the Hungarian leader called for immediate, unconditional peace talks, for the EU to launch direct negotiations with the Kremlin. He stressed his opposition to further EU funds for Ukraine, and rejected the use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukrainian defence.Now, with little sign of Russian willingness for compromise on Ukraine, Orban is focusing on Russian energy. Deals he struck in Washington to buy US liquefied natural gas and start buying US nuclear fuel mean Hungary will buy less of both from Russia, potentially annoying his Russian hosts.Orban argues that without deals with the US and Russia, heating prices would triple next month.Hungary is under pressure from the EU to end all imports of Russian energy by 2027 and is likely to use any agreement in Moscow to continue to defy Brussels.Hungary currently receives over 80% of its oil and gas, and 100% of its nuclear fuel from Russia, and total Hungarian trade contributes approximately $5bn annually to the Russian budget.Like Trump, Putin has made clear he wants Orban to win next April's election, so another diplomatic \"triumph\" for Orban would serve the interests of both sides. At this year's Valdai Forum in Sochi on 29 September, Putin praised Orban personally, and saluted \"nationally oriented political forces\" gaining ground in Europe.\"If these forces in Europe continue to grow stronger, then Europe will be reborn,\" Putin said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoYang TianandJames FitzGeraldWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromThe Trump administration has halted all asylum decisions following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington DC, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director has said.Joseph Edlow said the pause would be in place \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible\".It came hours after US President Donald Trump pledged to \"permanently pause migration\" from all \"third world countries\".The flurry of immigration decisions come in the wake of Wednesday's shooting, which left one soldier dead and another in a critical condition, and which officials have accused an Afghan national for perpetrating.While the first of these specifically targeted Afghans seeking to enter the US, other decisions have been far more wide-reaching.The USCIS - a branch of the Department of Homeland Security - has been told not to approve, deny or close asylum applications it receives for all nationalities, according CBS News, the BBC's US partner.Its officers can continue to work on asylum applications and review cases up to the point of making a decision, CBS reported.But few details are known about Friday's directive.Trump did not name which countries might be affected by his migration pause, which could face legal challenges and has already prompted pushback from UN agencies.The US president's recent announcements represent a further toughening of his stance towards migrants during his second presidency.Trump has also sought to enact mass deportations of illegal migrants, cut the annual number of refugee admissions, and to end automatic citizenship rights currently applicable to many born on US territory.Following Wednesday's fatal attack, the Trump administration temporarily stopped issuing visas to Afghans through the same programme the shooting suspect had, before suspending all immigration requests from Afghans pending a review.Then on Thursday, the USCIS said it would re-examine green cards issued to individuals who had migrated to the US from 19 countries, without mentioning Wednesday's attack.The agency referred to a June proclamation that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela. Details on what re-examination would look like were not provided.Trump then pledged to \"end all federal benefits and subsidies to non-citizens\" on Thursday. 'Third-world countries'Trump blamed refugees for causing the \"social dysfunction in America\" and vowed to remove \"anyone who is not a net asset\" to the US.\"Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia were completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota,\" he said.\"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"The phrase \"third world\" is one previously used to describe poorer, developing nations. Earlier this year, a travel ban was imposed on nationals primarily from 11 African and Asian nations, including Afghanistan. During Trump's first term, he enacted a travel ban targeting multiple Muslim-majority countries.The UN has urged the US to observe international agreements on asylum seekers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump's reaction to the shooting amounted to a \"scapegoating\" of migrants in the US, argued Jeremy McKinney, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.He told the BBC World Service's Newsday before Trump's latest remarks that the attacker's motive were unclear, and that radicalisation and mental illness could affect anyone. \"These types of issues - they don't know skin colour, they don't know nationality.\"Suspect in DC shooting is AfghanOfficials said the shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, came to the US in 2021.He travelled under a programme that offered special protections to Afghans who had worked with US forces in Afghanistan before their chaotic withdrawal and the return to power of the Taliban. Mr Lakanwal had been a member of a \"Zero Unit\" - an Afghan intelligence and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA - a former Afghan defence and security forces member told CBS.The US considered Zero Units to be among the most respected domestic forces in Afghanistan.The CIA's current director has confirmed that he previously worked with the US intelligence agency.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanHe would have been vetted by the US both when he started working with the CIA and when he travelled to the US, a senior US official told CNN.A childhood friend told the New York Times that Mr Lakanwal had experienced mental health issues after his work with his unit.Mr Lakanwal was reportedly granted asylum after Trump returned to office, having applied in 2024.But his request for a green card - which shows a person has permanent residence in the US - is pending, an official told CBS.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Fall of Zelensky's top aide - reboot for Kyiv or costly shake-up?54 minutes agoJames WaterhouseUkraine correspondent, in KyivGetty ImagesAndriy Yermak was one of Ukraine's most powerful figuresAndriy Yermak was a constant, looming presence in Ukraine's government - a seemingly immovable figure on the political stage.Despite his towering frame, you might not always have spotted him. Yet, wherever President Volodymyr Zelensky was, Yermak was often not far away.As his chief of staff, Yermak wielded enormous power at the top of government and was even trusted to negotiate on Ukraine's behalf at peace talks with the US.But as his influence grew, so did public resentment of the power this unelected official held. His political career came to an abrupt end on Friday, hours after anti-corruption investigators raided his home in Kyiv.Yermak and Zelensky first met in 2011 when the former was an intellectual property lawyer and the latter a TV producer.After working together during the successful presidential campaign of 2019, Yermak became Zelensky's chief of staff. He stood next to the president as he gave his now famous \"we are still here\" speech as the Russians descended on Kyiv at the start of their full-scale invasion in February 2022.As Zelensky concentrated his power over time, Yermak was widely viewed as the second most powerful person in Ukraine. He reportedly helped shape foreign policy, ousted political rivals and even made battlefield decisions.ReutersYermak (right) was always at the centre of the action in Ukraine's governmentUkrainian politics is shaped by big characters, and Zelensky's administration had not one, but two of them.Despite the favourable conditions Yermak enjoyed within the sprawling Presidential Office, the same couldn't be said outside its steep walls.His popularity was nosediving.A widening scandalZelensky had successfully grappled with corruption scandals in the past, but in July a chain of events began that has shaken the current government to its core, weakening him politically and costing him his right-hand man.That month, the president convinced parliament to formally remove the independence of Ukraine's two anti-corruption bodies and bring them under direct government control.At the time, Zelensky said it was to limit Russian interference. But the public - as well as the European Union - disagreed, and he was forced to U-turn after mass demonstrations.Getty ImagesThe decision to strip anti-corruption bodies of their independence sparked mass protests, which in turn forced a government U-turnBy the autumn, those same agencies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sapo), released the findings of a lengthy investigation that implicated members of Zelensky's inner circles.Senior figures - including two ministers, a former deputy prime minister and a one-time business partner of Zelensky's - were accused of syphoning $100m (£75m) from public projects in the energy sector.At a time when Russia is pummelling Ukraine's energy grid with missiles and drones ahead of a fourth winter of war - forcing the entire country to endure daily power cuts - public anger at these corruption allegations has soared. Just on Friday night alone, Kyiv endured a nearly 11-hour-long Russian air raid, which left more than half a million people without power.\"We're going through one of the most difficult times in our history,\" Iryna, a Kyiv resident, told the BBC this week. \"Unfortunately, lots of families will not see their loved ones, their men, brothers or husbands, because of the war.\"Despite not being named as a suspect and denying any involvement in the scheme, Andriy Yermak couldn't distance himself. There was a suspicion he may have known something. Local media reported on Saturday that investigators were combing through several laptops and mobile phones they had seized from his flat during their search.Yermak led last week's talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Geneva, apparently securing some concessions for his country in a US-drafted peace proposal which many feared heavily favoured Russia.Getty ImagesMr Yermak was a key figure in negotiations with the USYermak resigns after anti-corruption raidAt a time when Ukraine is fighting and negotiating for its very survival, his resignation is hugely destabilising.Talks will continue next week. Ukraine's presidential office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Rustem Umerov was the head of a delegation heading to the US.What is not known is whether this will be a timely reboot for Kyiv, or a costly lack of continuity.It is also not known how Yermak is taking his sudden departure from government. The New York Post reported on Saturday that he had texted their paper and vowed to go to the front line. He also declared his innocence. \"I'm going to the front and am prepared for any reprisals,\" he reportedly said. \"I am an honest and decent person.\"But there is a feeling that Yermak's departure is a sign of positive change.\"Let's call it what it is: good news,\" says Olga Rudenko, editor of the Kyiv Independent.\"Think about it: a young democracy like Ukraine has independent institutions that are strong enough to investigate the most powerful man in the country - and to do so during the war.\"People rooting for Ukraine around the world aren't rooting for a place on the map, but for a place living by certain values - and fighting for them. Today we see these values in action.\"This shows why Ukraine is exactly the country worth supporting.\"Additional reporting by Toby Luckhurst",

    "body": "'This was preventable': Anger and unanswered questions after Hong Kong fire1 day agoKoh EweandKelly NgVideo shows how fast fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseShock is giving way to anger in Hong Kong after a massive fire ripped through a densely populated subsidised housing estate on Wednesday, killing at least 128 people and critically injuring dozens.Authorities say substandard mesh and plastic sheets on the buildings' windows may have spread the blaze, which raged for more than a day.Firefighting operations have now ended, with dozens of residents still unaccounted for.Questions are mounting as to how the fire at Wang Fuk Court spread so rapidly and who is responsible, with many calling it a \"man-made disaster\".Three people in charge of renovating the blocks are under arrest for manslaughter, and authorities have launched a corruption inquiry.A post that has gone viral on social media in the wake of the blaze reads: \"It's not an accident.\"Several residents have revealed in interviews that the fire alarm did not sound when the fire broke out. Authorities said on Friday that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working properly. Kiko Ma, who owns an apartment at Wang Fuk Court, says the alarms had been turned off amid renovation works, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to get in and out of the building. Ms Ma lives in Canada with her family, but visits the Hong Kong apartment several times a year.\"This was preventable... A lot of people did not do their duties,\" the 33-year-old tells the BBC, claiming that the renovation firm used \"poor quality, flammable materials\".Residents often saw construction workers smoking and found cigarette butts along their window ledges, she adds.\"People kept asking what would happen if there was a fire. Everyone was very worried about this.\"Getty ImagesThe blaze spread rapidly and went on for more than a day in some blocksThis is Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years - already having surpassed the toll of the August 1962 inferno in the Sham Shui Po neighbourhood, which killed 44 people and displaced hundreds.Built in the 1980s, Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's north-eastern Tai Po district comprises eight 31-storey buildings, seven of which went up in flames. The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.Police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards. In a presser on Friday they attributed the rapid spread of the fire to styrofoam blocks placed outside the windows of the apartments, apparently to \"protect\" them from the debris and dust.Some experts also believe the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks helped fuel the inferno. Such scaffolding is an iconic sight across Hong Kong, and widely used in construction.Earlier this year, authorities announced plans to phase out bamboo in favour of sturdier, fire-resistant steel, citing bamboo's combustibility and deterioration over time.Getty ImagesHundreds of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters while emergency housing units are being allocated to someResidents at Wang Fuk Court had expressed unease about renovation plans when they were announced last year. Reports of those concerns have now resurfaced online, sparking accusations around a lack of transparency.Another homeowner who was abroad when the fire broke out said the plans were \"fundamentally shady\". \"[Those in charge] used small favours to encourage unsuspecting elderly residents to support their plans,\" they wrote in a comment on Instagram.Mr Lai, a sales associate who the BBC agreed to refer to by his last name only, says Wang Fuk Court residents had earlier questioned the high cost of renovation works. Calls from some residents to re-elect the estate's management committee went unheeded, he added. This week's fire is not an isolated incident, Mr Lai said, claiming that construction companies \"often prioritise cost efficiency\" over safety. He noted that a building in Hong Kong's Central district went up in flames last month after its bamboo scaffolding caught fire.\"When similar incidents happen, they raise the question of whether [there are] systemic weaknesses.\"Hong Kong authorities on Thursday ordered inspections of all housing estates undergoing \"major repairs\" to check for the \"safety of scaffolding and building materials\".",

    "body": "17 hours agoImogen FoulkesGeneva CorrespondentThe United Nations committee on torture says there is evidence that Israel is operating a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\". The committee regularly reviews the records of all countries which have signed the convention against torture, taking testimony from their governments, and from human rights groups.During Israel's review both Israeli and Palestinian rights groups gave harrowing details about conditions in Israeli detention centres. It is alleged that thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel since the Hamas attacks of October 7th 2023. Under Israel's laws on administrative detention and on Unlawful Combatants – suspects who cannot be classed as prisoner of war - they can be held for long periods without access to a lawyer or family members. Many Palestinian families say they have waited months to even find out that a loved has been detained, amounting, the UN committee said, to \"enforced disappearance\".The committee was particularly critical of Israel's reported use of the Unlawful Combatants law to detain whole groups of Palestinians, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.But it is the reported conditions in detention which make the grimmest reading in the committee's conclusions, published today. Palestinians, the evidence suggests, are regularly deprived of food and water, and subjected to severe beatings, attacks by dogs, electrocution, water boarding, and sexual violence. Some are allegedly permanently shackled, denied access to a toilet, and forced to wear diapers.The committee concluded that such treatment \"amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity\". It said evidence of a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\" by Israel was one of the acts which constitute the crime of genocide under international law. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.One committee member, Peter Vedel Kessing of Denmark, said he and his colleagues were \"deeply appalled\" by what they heard. Committee members also said they were very concerned at the lack of investigations or prosecutions into allegations of torture. They called on Israel to launch independent investigations, and to ensure those responsible, including senior military officers, are held accountable.Israel, which has long accused the UN of bias against it, did not comment publicly today on the committee's findings, but during the committee hearings its ambassador, Daniel Meron, described the allegations of torture as \"disinformation\". He said that Israel was \"committed to upholding its obligations in line with our moral values and principles, even in the face of the challenges posed by a terrorist organisation\".In its conclusions, the UN committee took care to unequivocally condemn the Hamas attack of October 2023, and acknowledged the security challenges Israel faces. But it also warned that violations of international law by one side did not justify the other side doing the same. Under the convention, to which Israel is a party, the prohibition on torture is absolute: it is not allowed under any circumstances.Israel's domestic law is less clear however, suggesting that the convention only applies to Israeli territory, and not to the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank – an interpretation that many international lawyers dispute.The findings come amid increasing pressure on Israel over its human rights record. On Friday in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Office said the killing by Israeli soldiers of two Palestinians in the West Bank looked like a \"summary execution\". Video of the killing showed the two men with their hands up, apparently surrendering to Israeli forces.And UN aid agencies say conditions for people in the Gaza strip remain dire, despite the ceasefire. Thousands of families are facing the winter cold and rain in tents, they warn, not enough aid supplies are getting in, and Israeli air strikes against what Israel says are Hamas targets continue.",

    "body": "Ex-president's daughter resigns over allegations she duped South Africans to fight for Russia22 hours agoNomsa Maseko,BBC AfricaandKhanyisile Ngcobo,JohannesburgGallo Images/Getty ImagesThe daughter of South Africa's ex-President Jacob Zuma denies tricking people into joining the Russia-Ukraine warThe daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma has resigned as an MP following allegations that she tricked 17 men to fight for Russia as mercenaries in Ukraine.Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, who became a member of parliament for the main opposition party uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) last year, has said in an affidavit that she thought the men were going to Russia for \"lawful\" training.MK says it was her decision to resign as she wants to focus her efforts on ensuring the return of those trapped in Ukraine's war-torn Donbas region.The brother of one of the men, who has been sending desperate voices notes about his situation, has told the BBC the family wants accountability and his safe return.\"Things you see in the movies, we're seeing it live,\" the 40-year-old said in one of the messages shared with the BBC by his family about the horrors they were being subjected to in Ukraine.The BBC is withholding his identity for his safety, and has called him Sipho and his brother - who is in South Africa, trying to help secure his return - Xolani.\"He's living in fear because he doesn't know what the future holds or what will happen to him when night approaches because they are always in a war zone,\" says Xolani, adding that the resignation of Zuma-Sambudla, whose father now leads MK, means nothing to the family.\"She's just trying to save the reputation of her father's political party… The families want accountability and the return of the men who were tricked into fighting for Russia.\"The BBC has heard voice notes Sipho sent in which he says he was recruited by two people - one of them being Zuma-Sambudla.\"They [the alleged recruiters] even bought us flight tickets to get here [Russia],\" Sipho says in one of the voice notes. Zuma-Sambudla has denied intentionally misleading anyone and says she is \"profoundly shocked\", adding that she herself is  a victim of deception and manipulation.Xolani says that his brother left South Africa on 8 July, thinking he was going to be trained as a bodyguard for MK. The party has distanced itself from the controversy. \"The national officials have accepted comrade Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla's decision to resign and support her efforts to ensure that these young South Africans are brought back safely to their families,\" MK chairperson Nkosinathi Nhleko said at a press conference on Friday.Formed in 2023, MK is named after the now-defunct military wing of the governing African National Congress (ANC) when it was fighting the racist system of apartheid in South Africa. Ex-President Zuma was a long-standing member of the ANC, before breaking away to form MK to contest last year's parliamentary elections after a massive fall-out with his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa.The sister of another South African trapped in Donbas has told the BBC that her brother was recruited to receive \"counter-intelligence\" and \"bodyguard\" training for MK - an offer he took up because he was unemployed.He did not expect to be in the battlefield under the command of Russian men.\"They are treated as slaves, told what to do, and if they don't co-operate they are threatened,\" she tells the BBC.ReutersSouth Africa's ex-President Jacob Zuma has tried to cultivate a revolutionary image for his partyXolani adds that when the group - including his brother - arrived in Russia, they were given contracts to sign but \"unfortunately\" they were written in Russian which they did not understand.According to Xolani, the group then appealed to Zuma-Sambudla and the other alleged recruiter, whom he named, for help.The duo then travelled to Russia, which Xolani says convinced the group to sign the contract as they \"trusted them\", he says.In a voice note to the family that the BBC has heard, Sipho says that he, along with the rest of the group, were taken to Ukraine in early August. They were then separated, and he was among those who ended up in Donetsk in Donbas.\"[We're] close to the front line, maybe about 10km [six miles] away,\" Sipho says in the voice note.In a video screen recording shared with the BBC, from the WhatsApp group used by some of them, the men express their distress about their movements in the war zone.In the group, one of them writes: \"We were told that we are going to a safe place but we went even more deeper in the bad place. And when we arrived here, they [sic] were 3 drone attacks.\"Another says: \"If anything happens guys… until next time.\"At some point, a contact is added to the WhatsApp group under the name \"Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla\".This person tries to allay the fears of the men as she appeals to them to \"hang in there, we are doing everything we can\".The BBC reached out to this number, but it went unanswered. We then sent a WhatsApp message to the number, which had an image of Zuma-Sambudla in the profile picture.The former MP filed an affidavit with police after her half-sister, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube, accused her of tricking South Africans to join the war.On Tuesday, South Africa's elite police unit, the Hawks, confirmed that both women had registered cases with the police.The Hawks did not give any details, but said in a statement that \"both matters are being investigated jointly to determine whether any criminality, including possible human trafficking, illegal recruitment, exploitation or fraud\" had taken place.The BBC has seen a copy of Zuma-Sambudla's affidavit, which is unsigned but was widely reported in local media. \"I was not a recruiter, agent, operator or facilitator of any unlawful activity,\" she says.The BBC has also seen a statement Zuma-Mncube gave police, alleging that her half-sister - along with two men, whom she named - lured 17 South Africans to Russia \"under false pretences\" and were \"handed to a Russian mercenary group to fight in the Ukraine war without their knowledge or consent\". \"Among these 17 men, who are requesting the South African government for assistance, are eight of my family members,\" Zuma-Mncube says in the statement. In her affidavit, Zuma-Sambudla reveals that she herself had received non-combat training in Russia, and it was arranged by a man whom, she says, she did not know until he contacted her.When he suggested recruiting more people to take part in what she believed would be a similar programme, she \"shared [this] information innocently\" with others, including family members, she says in the affidavit.\"I would not, under any circumstances, knowingly expose my own family or any other person to harm,\" the MP adds in the affidavit.The discovery that people had been tricked into joining the war had \"caused me profound shock and distress\", she says.\"I am myself a victim of deception, misrepresentation, and manipulation,\" Zuma-Sambudla adds in the affidavit. Earlier this month, the South African government confirmed it had received distress calls from 17 of its citizens trapped in Donbas after being lured to join mercenary forces on the promise of lucrative contracts.One of the voice notes the BBC heard says that 24 South Africans had originally been duped into going to Ukraine, but three of them were taken back to Russia as they were deemed to be medically unfit.Another voice note says one of the South Africans who was forced to stay in Ukraine was wounded, possibly by shrapnel and his whereabouts are unknown.A report by financial news agency Bloomberg said some men had also been recruited from neighbouring Botswana.South Africa's government has remained tight-lipped on the situation since its statement earlier this month. It had promised to work through \"diplomatic channels\" to bring them back home, but this has not yet happened.With his brother still trapped in a war zone, Xolani speaks of his family's anguish.\"We can go five days without hearing from him because he's off doing military stuff. The family is concerned about his life,\" he says.In the meantime in voice-note exchanges with his family, Sipho keeps repeating the appeal: \"It's tough here... we all [just] want to come home.\" You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Scientists believe they have recorded electrical activity in the Martian atmosphere for the first time, suggesting the planet is capable of lightning.Nasa's Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology and has spent the last four years exploring the Jezero Crater region.Electrical discharges nicknamed \"mini lightning\" were picked up from audio and electromagnetic recordings made by the rover's SuperCam instrument.Scientists hope new instruments for measuring atmospheric discharges and more-sensitive cameras could be sent to Mars to try to confirm the findings.A team of researchers from France analysed 28 hours of microphone recordings made by the Nasa rover over two Martian years (or 1,374 Earth days).They found that electrical discharges were normally associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts.Dust devils are small whirlwinds that form from hot air rising from the ground, and their internal movements can give rise to electrical discharges.Lead author of the research Dr Baptiste Chide told news agency Reuters: \"These discharges represent a major discovery, with direct implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability and the future of robotic and human exploration.\"He and other scientists at the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in France believe that Mars now joins Earth, Saturn and Jupiter as planets known to have atmospheric electrical activity.Particle physicist Dr Daniel Pritchard wrote in scientific journal Nature that, although the recordings would \"provide persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges\", because the discharges were only heard and not seen, \"some doubt will inevitably remain as to whether this really was Martian lightning\". He added: \"Given the history of this field, the debate is likely to continue for some time.\"In September this year, scientists found rocks with unusual markings on Mars. The intriguing markings, nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds, contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient microbes.It is possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found.Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life.Perseverance was dispatched to the Jezero Crater because it showed qualities that may have meant it was once conducive to life, including signs it was once a delta when Mars could sustain liquid surface water.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichael Sheils McNamee,Business reporter and Danielle Kaye,Business reporterOpenAI has signed a $38bn (£29bn) contract with Amazon to access its cloud computing infrastructure, as the start-up continues its run of major partnerships to secure computing power. In 2025, the ChatGPT maker has signed deals worth more than $1tn with Oracle, Broadcom, AMD and chip-making giant Nvidia. Its latest deal reduces its reliance on Microsoft.As part of the seven-year agreement, OpenAI will gain access to Nvidia graphics processors to train its artificial intelligence models. The deal follows a sweeping restructure of OpenAI last week which saw it convert away from being a non-profit and changed its relationship with Microsoft to give OpenAI more operational and financial freedom.\"Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,\" said OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman.\"Our partnership with AWS [Amazon Web Services] strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.\"The deal reflects the massive demand for computer power coming from the growing interest in AI - and OpenAI's rush to secure the power it needs.OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, had been reliant on Microsoft for computing power for years. The two firms had an exclusive cloud agreement until January of this year, when their relationship loosened.The AI start-up's first agreement with Amazon's AWS marks its latest shift away from Microsoft toward diversified sources of computing power. \"The deal with AWS shows that OpenAI considers that its path to leadership is paved with getting access to as much computing power as it can get its hands on,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.Microsoft \"taking less of a control stake in the company has allowed relationships with near competitors to OpenAI's funders possible,\" she added.But OpenAI has been unprofitable, as spends big to get ahead in the development of AI technology. Quarterly results from Microsoft last week indicated that OpenAI lost $12bn in just the last quarter.Following the announcement of the deal on Monday, Amazon shares hit an all-time high, adding $140bn (£106bn) to its valuation.AWS is \"uniquely positioned to support OpenAI's vast AI workloads,\" Matt Garman, CEO of AWS, said in a statement.Leading AI firms have been investing in one another, creating a tangled web of deals that has been drawing scrutiny. OpenAI is at the centre of that web.In response to OpenAI's deal spree, there has been some speculation that an AI bubble may be in the offing.Speaking to the BBC last month, Sam Altman said: \"Yes, the investment loans are unprecedented\", but added: \"It's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast.\"Warnings have come from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, as well as from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who told the BBC that \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBC/Getty ImagesBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni have been at loggerheads since starring together in It Ends With UsJustin Baldoni's $400m (£295m) lawsuit against his former co-star Blake Lively has been formally ended by a judge, who said the actor and director had failed to meet a deadline to continue his claim.The pair, who starred in the 2024 film It Ends with Us, have been locked in a bitter legal battle since Lively sued Baldoni last December accusing him of sexual harassment and waging a smear campaign against her.In response, he filed a lawsuit against her as well as her husband Ryan Reynolds, their publicist and the New York Times, claiming civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.Baldoni's case was dismissed in June, but he had a chance to file an amended complaint. However, Judge Lewis Liman said he had failed to do.ReutersBaldoni also named Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds in the lawsuitThe judge said he had contacted all of the parties on 17 October to give them warning that he would enter a final judgement to conclude the case.Only Lively responded, asking for the final judgement to be declared, but for her request for legal fees to remain active. The judge agreed.Her original lawsuit against Baldoni is also ongoing.After Baldoni's case was dismissed in June, the actress's lawyers called it \"a total victory and a complete vindication\".At the time, Baldoni's lawyer said Lively's \"predictable declaration of victory is false\", and that \"with the facts on our side, we march forward\".He added: \"While the court dismissed the defamation related claims, the court has invited us to amend four out of the seven claims against Ms Lively, which will showcase additional evidence and refined allegations.\"However, those amended claims were not filed, according to the latest ruling. Baldoni and Wayfarer have not commented.ReutersJustin Baldoni directed and starred in It Ends With Us, based on the Colleen Hoover novelIn June, Judge Liman explained that Baldoni's lawsuit centred on two claims: that Lively \"stole the film\" from him and his production company Wayfarer by threatening not to promote it, and that she and others promoted a false narrative that Baldoni sexually assaulted her and launched a smear campaign against her.But Baldoni and his production company \"have not adequately alleged that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion rather than legally permissible hard bargaining or renegotiation of working conditions\", Judge Liman wrote at that time.Additionally, the judge wrote, Baldoni and his company did not prove defamation because the \"Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements\" in her lawsuit, which are privileged.The judge also determined that evidence did not show that the New York Times \"acted with actual malice\" in publishing their story, dismissing that $250m suit as well.\"The alleged facts indicate that the Times reviewed the available evidence and reported, perhaps in a dramatised manner, what it believed to have happened,\" he wrote. \"The Times had no obvious motive to favour Lively's version of events.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoGetty ImagesA search and rescue operation continues for the rest of the group, which includes other foreign nationals and local guidesKathryn Armstrong and Diwakar Pyakurel & Phanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali in KathmanduAt least three climbers, including a French national and two Nepalese people, have died after being hit by an avalanche on a Himalayan peak in north-eastern Nepal, police say. The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. A further four climbers - two Italians, a German and a Canadian - are feared dead but a search for them is continuing. The killed and missing were part of a group of 12 trekkers and local guides that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told the BBC. Five Nepali guides who returned to the base camp were injured but not critically. \"Three bodies have been seen and rescue teams have to find four more,\" local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC. It is not clear if the other two confirmed dead, who are both Nepali, were working with the group or were climbers themselves. Mr Mahato said a rescue helicopter had landed on Monday in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp.Efforts to locate those still missing have been hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, according to local media reports. The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft).The Yalung Ri mountain is located in Nepal's Dolakha districtSeparately, attempts to rescue two Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale the Panbari mountain in western Nepal are continuing.Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week. The third member of the group, named in media reports as Velter Perlino, 65, has since been rescued.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains. Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas. Two British and one Irish woman were among a group that had to be rescued after being trapped for several days in the western Mustang region. Severe weather also left hundreds of hikers stranded near Mount Everest in October. ",

    "body": "Drones have been seen flying over a Belgian military base near the Dutch border for a third night in a row, according to the country's defence minister said.A helicopter was deployed to the Kleine-Brogel base after drones were spotted - they then flew off towards the Netherlands, national broadcaster VRT reported.Defence Minister Theo Francken said an investigation was under way, calling it \"a clear mission targeting Kleine Broge\".Francken told Belgian radio on Monday that it looked like an espionage operation, but said he would not speculate on who could be behind it.\"I have some ideas, but I'm going to be cautious,\" he added.Drones were also spotted flying above other military air bases - the Leopoldsburg, in central Limburg province, and Marche-en-Famenne in the south-east of the country.  VRT reported over the weekend that drones were also seen close to coastal Ostend and Antwerp's Deurne airports.It marks the latest incident involving drones disrupting European airspace in recent months. In October, unconfirmed drone sightings forced Germany's Munich airport to suspend operations twice in 24 hours.The month before, Denmark said drones flown over its airports appeared to be the work of a \"professional actor\".At the time, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said there was no evidence to suggest Russia was behind the incursion.The Russian embassy in Copenhagen denied \"absurd speculations\" of its involvement.Also in September, Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members, after around 20 Russian drones crossed into Poland and Russian MiG31 jets entered Estonian airspace.Russia denied violating Estonia's airspace and insisted the Polish incursion was not deliberate.The European Commission has since proposed four defence projects, including a counter-drone system, as part of plans to get the continent ready to defend itself by 2030.",

    "body": "The Maldives has banned young people born on or after 1 January 2007 from smoking tobacco, becoming the only country in the world to enforce a nationwide generational tobacco prohibition.The archipelago's health ministry announced on Saturday that it would be illegal for younger generations to use, buy or sell tobacco within the country.The ban \"reflects the government's strong commitment to protecting young people from the harms of tobacco\", the ministry said. Ahmed Afaal, vice chair of the archipelago's tobacco control board, told BBC World Service's Newshour programme that the country's general vaping ban last year had been a \"good step towards a generation of tobacco-free citizens\". The new ban \"applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale\", the health ministry said, adding that it aligned with the Maldives' obligations under the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.According to the UN's health body, this convention \"provides a global response to a global problem – namely, the tobacco epidemic\".Mr Afaal said the country's crackdown on vaping had been an important first step because \"these new stylish gadgets are tactics of the industry to approach the younger generations to uptake addictive processes, which definitely harms their health\".Last year, the Maldives made it illegal for anyone to import, sell, possess, use or distribute electronic cigarettes and vaping products, regardless of age.Tourists coming to visit the Maldives' islands will also have to adhere to the law, but Mr Afaal argues the smoking ban will not have a detrimental impact on tourism.\"People don't come to the Maldives because they're able to smoke. They come for the beaches, they come for the sea, they come for the sun, and they come for the fresh air,\" he added.Quoting tourism data, Mr Afaal argued that despite the new regulations there had been no tourist cancellations and the number of arrivals had grown in the past year.\"We're projecting more than 2m [tourists] in the next year,\" he said. Plans by New Zealand to pass a generational smoking ban were scrapped in 2023 after a new government took power.The move was seen as a blow to many health experts and Māori people in particular, who have one of the highest smoking rates.Last year, the UK's then-Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, had hoped to introduce a law that would ban young people born on or after 2009 from smoking.A new version of the legislation, introduced by the current government, has passed through the Commons and is now at the committee stage at the House of Lords - nearing its last hurdles before it gets royal assent.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Southern Europe correspondent, Rome and Jake LaphamWatch: Moment part of medieval tower collapses in RomePart of a medieval tower in the heart of Rome has collapsed, trapping one worker and leaving another critically injured.A section of the Torre dei Conti, on the edge of the famous Roman Forum and close to the Colosseum, gave way just after 11:30 local time (10:30 GMT). \"It's a very complex situation for the firefighters because there is a person trapped inside,\" Rome Prefect Lamberto Giannini said. The man is conscious and communicating with rescue workers.The tower has been closed to the public for many years, and was undergoing conservation work when a section collapsed.While rescue efforts were still under way, a second section of the 29m (90ft) high tower began crumbling again, with bricks raining down, creating a huge cloud of dust.The firefighters were unharmed, pausing their rescue work for a time, but then continuing their search for the missing man.After the initial collapse, firefighters \"put up some protection\" around the trapped man, so when the second collapse happened, \"they obviously shielded him\", Lamberto Giannini said.\"It will be a very long operation because we have to try to save the person, but we also have to try to mitigate... the enormous risks faced by the people trying to carry out the rescue,\" he added.A police chief has said there is no imminent danger that the tower will disintegrate.One worker was taken to hospital in a critical condition, local and foreign news agencies report.Another worker, 67-year-old Ottaviano, who was inside at the time of the collapse but escaped from a balcony uninjured, told AFP news agency: \"It was not safe. I just want to go home.\"Rome's mayor and the country's culture minister have visited the scene. A crane and drone are also being used to assist with the rescue operation.The 13th Century tower is part of the Roman Forum, a major tourist attraction right in the heart of the city, but it is separated from the main visitors' area by a road. The streets all around have been taped off by police as a precaution.The medieval tower was built by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his brother.",

    "body": "The Netherlands has said it will return a stolen 3,500-year-old sculpture to Egypt.It is \"highly likely\" the stone head, dating from the time of the pharaohs, was plundered during the Arab Spring in either 2011 or 2012, according to the Dutch  Information & Heritage Inspectorate.A decade later, it turned up at an arts and antiques fair in Maastricht and, following an anonymous tip-off, Dutch authorities determined it had been stolen and exported illegally. Dutch outgoing prime minister Dick Schoof made the pledge to hand it back as he attended the opening of the archaeological Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza this weekend.The Dutch government said the sculpture of a high-ranking official from the dynasty of Pharaoh Thutmose III is \"deeply meaningful to Egypt's identity\".The statue had been offered up for sale at The European Fine Art Foundation fair in 2022. The dealer voluntarily relinquished the sculpture after authorities had been tipped off about its illegal origin. The government said it expected to hand the stone head over to the Egyptian ambassador to the Netherlands at the end of this year.\"The Netherlands is committed both nationally and internationally to ensuring the return of heritage to its original owners,\" it said.The news comes as Egypt celebrated the opening of the enormous Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing its archaeological heritage this weekend.First proposed in 1992, the construction of the museum itself was interrupted by the Arab Spring.Costing around $1.2bn (£910m), the facility contains 100,000 artefacts, including the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun and his famous gold mask.Prominent Egyptologists are hoping the museum will strengthen demands for key antiquities held in other countries to be returned.These include the Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering hieroglyphics, which is on display at the British Museum in London.",

The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to cut federal grants and funding for projects primarily located in Democratic-run areas.Opinion polls indicate Mamdani is ahead of his main rival, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, on the eve of Tuesday's vote.Trump did not elaborate on his remark about funding should Mamdani win. New York City received $7.4bn (£5.7bn) in federal funding this fiscal year.  New Yorkers could pick a political newcomer to run their city - and take on TrumpWho is Zohran Mamdani?In a wide-ranging interview with CBS programme 60 Minutes on Sunday, Trump said that a Mayor Mamdani would make left-wing former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \"look great\". \"I got to see de Blasio, how bad a mayor he was, and this man will do a worse job than de Blasio by far,\" the president said of Mamdani. Trump, who grew up in the New York borough of Queens, also effectively endorsed Cuomo, a Democrat, in the interview. \"I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other, but if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a Communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,\" the Republican president said.Mamdani, who would run a world financial hub, is a self-described democratic socialist, though he has rejected accusations he is a communist, joking in one television interview that he was \"kind of like a Scandinavian politician\", only browner.Getty ImagesMamdani won the Democratic mayoral primaryMamdani won the Democratic primary, while Cuomo came second. The 34-year-old state assemblyman has called the former New York governor a puppet and parrot of Trump. \"The answer to a Donald Trump presidency is not to create its mirror image here in City Hall,\" Mamdani said on Monday. \"It is to create an alternative that can speak to what New Yorkers are so desperate to see in their own city and what they find in themselves and their neighbours every day - a city that believes in the dignity of everyone who calls this place home.\"Cuomo has sought to parry that line of attack by presenting himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the Trump administration.He was governor of New York during the Covid-19 pandemic when many states clashed with the Trump administration, though Cuomo himself came under scrutiny after state investigators found nursing home deaths were significantly understated during the outbreak.\"I fought Donald Trump,\" Cuomo said during a debate. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\" Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities as part of a crime crackdown, while seeking to strip funding from jurisdictions that limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities.

    "body": "The president of Spain's Valencia region, Carlos Mazón, has resigned after months of pressure over his handling of flash floods last year.A total of 229 people died in towns in the Valencia region on 29 October 2024, with a further eight dying in neighbouring regions, in Spain's worst natural disaster for decades.Many in Valencia blamed Mazón for the scale of the tragedy because of how he and his government responded that day. It emerged that the regional president had spent nearly four hours in a restaurant with a journalist, Maribel Vilaplana, while the floodwater was wreaking havoc and he did not attend emergency meetings during much of the day.Mazón's government also failed to issue an emergency alert to the phones of Valencia residents warning them of the floods and providing advice until after 20:00, by which times dozens of people had already died.\"I can't go on anymore... I know that I made mistakes, I acknowledge it and I will live with them for the rest of my life,\" Mazón said as he announced his decision, adding that he should have cancelled his schedule for that day to take charge of the crisis. \"I have said sorry and I say it again, but none of [the mistakes] were due to political calculation or bad faith.\"Polls had shown that the vast majority of people in Valencia wanted Mazón, of the conservative People's Party (PP), to step down because of his management of the floods. Monthly protests were held demanding his resignation, most recently on 25 October, when an estimated 50,000 people turned out on the streets of Valencia. Mazón had been making fewer public appearances in recent months because of the abuse he received from members of the public.However, his insistence on attending the memorial service for victims on the first anniversary of the tragedy last week angered relatives of those who died and a number of them barracked him during the ceremony. Mazón seemed shaken by the experience, which appeared to prompt his decision to resign.His announcement came the same day that Maribel Vilaplana, the journalist with who he had lunch on the day of the floods, testified before a judge who is investigating possible negligence.According to Spanish media reports, Vilaplana told the magistrate that Mazón \"was constantly texting on his phone\" and that at one point he received \"a lot of calls\".Mazón will continue as a member of the regional parliament, meaning he has immunity from prosecution in this case.During his resignation announcement, Mazón criticised the left-wing central government of Pedro Sánchez, accusing it of blocking aid to his region \"purely to cause us political damage\".Mazón has become an increasingly problematic figure for the PP over the last year, with concerns that his unpopularity threatened to undermine the party's electoral prospects not just in the Valencia region but nationwide. However, his replacement has been complicated by the fact that the PP relies on the parliamentary support in the region of the far-right Vox. That party, which has been gaining ground on the PP in polls there, will have to agree to his successor.The leader of the PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, who had spoken with Mazón at length on Sunday to discuss his future and is widely believed to have influenced his decision to resign, welcomed the announcement. He also defended Mazón from the criticism to which he has been subject, saying that \"he is not a murderer\".\"He made mistakes, yes, he also apologised and acknowledged them today, but no national emergency depends on just one person.\"",

    "body": "23 hours agoFrank Gardnersecurity correspondent, in BahrainNato \"will stand with Ukraine up to the day in which we will have them sitting around the table for a long-lasting peace\", a senior official from the military alliance has told the BBC.Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of Nato's military committee since January, added from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was bogged down, and \"it was almost time to sit and talk because it's a waste of lives\".Pointing to the fact that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had resulted in two more countries joining the Western alliance - Finland and Sweden - Adm Dragone described the war as a strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent slow, incremental advances by Russia on the battlefield. \"They will not get a friendly or puppet government like in Belarus. Putin will not succeed.\"Asked if European nations were prepared to keep going with supporting Ukraine's defence, he said they were. It was beneficial, he believed that they had had something of a wake-up call and were now taking charge of their own defence.In June, Nato members agreed to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. The move followed repeated urges from US President Donald Trump for members to do so.On Russia's recent announcement about long-range, nuclear-powered weapons like the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, the former Italian chief of defence staff and naval aviator played down concerns by Nato, saying that it was a defensive nuclear alliance. \"We are not threatened by them,\" he said, \"we are just ready to defend our 32 nations and our one billion people. We are a nuclear alliance.\"On the risk of future invasions or attacks, Adm Dragone said if - and he emphasised the conditional here - there was to be anywhere it would likely be the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But he pointed out that as Nato states Article 5 would be requested - which considers an attack on one nation to be equivalent to an attack on all - and that Nato would come to their defence. Asked if that included the US, he replied: \"Yes, because they have committed to this and they have underlined that they are still in the business.\"Of all Nato defence needs right now, Adm Dragone said air defence was the top priority. Recent incursions by Russian drones into Poland and Romania have prompted the alliance to upgrade its air defences. Regarding the possibility of activating a notional \"drone wall\" on Nato's eastern borders, he said this would be done within months and that \"the alliance's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk [Virginia] is already working on that\".\"There is a lot of stuff on the market which will fulfil our immediate needs so we set up a new activity which is Eastern Sentry... integrating all the air defence that we already have on our eastern flank. \"Airspace incursions are pretty frequent, we escort them out and that's basically the game,\" the admiral said.Despite no sign that Russia is changing course on the war in Ukraine and despite signs that some members - notably Slovakia and Hungary - are increasingly opposed to supporting Ukraine's defence, Adm Dragone ended on a positive note. \"The alliance is reliable, it is mature, there is a cohesion which is our centre of gravity.\"\"The alliance is stronger than our adversaries, and we will stay with Ukraine up to the day that peace will break out,\" he added.",

    "body": "Popular Malaysian rapper Namewee has been charged with illegal drug use and possession, local media reported on Monday, quoting Kuala Lumpur police.Namewee, who pleaded not guilty to both charges, has been released on bail after being arrested last month, authorities said.The 42-year-old is known for his satirical songs and music videos about taboo topics in Malaysia, from obscenity to religion to China's censorship.In an Instagram post on Sunday, Namewee denied using or carrying drugs.\"The truth will be out when the police report is released,\" he wrote.Kuala Lumpur police chief Fadil Marsus said that Namewee was arrested on 22 October in a hotel room, where they found pills believed to be ecstasy - also known as MDMA.Namewee later tested positive for illicit substances - including amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine, and THC - and was remanded for two days, Fadil said in a statement.If convicted of drug possession, he could be jailed up to five years and caned.A police official told local media that Namewee had been in the same hotel at the same time as Iris Hsieh, a Taiwanese influencer who was found dead in her hotel room bathtub.Namewee wrote on Instagram that he felt \"deeply sorry\" about Hsieh's death. The ambulance had taken \"nearly an hour\" to arrive at the scene, he wrote.He said that he had remained silent as the case was under investigation - though it's unclear if he's referring to his drug charges or Hsieh's death.He also claimed that he has received \"blackmail\" in recent days but would \"fight to the end\".Namewee has long courted controversy with his music.In 2016 he was arrested in Malaysia for his music video Oh My God, which was filmed at various places of worship around the country. Critics said the song insulted religious sensitivities.In 2021, he released the song Fragile, which poked fun at Chinese nationalists and touched on politically sensitive topics like the sovereignty of Taiwan and the persecution of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. The song went viral for Mandarin-speaking audiences but was banned by China.",

    "body": "An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains has killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, according to rescuers. The mountaineers, travelling in separate groups, were scaling Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps at around 16:00 local time on Saturday when the fast-moving snow hit.  A group of three people \"was fully swept away by the avalanche\" and all died, said Italy's Alpine rescue service, Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico.Separately, the father and daughter were carried away by the avalanche and their bodies were recovered on Sunday. Two other climbers in a third party survived.The alarm was raised by the survivors, triggering the rescue operation.Olaf Reinstadler, a spokesperson for the Sulden Mountain Rescue Service, told German media that the avalanche on the 3,545-metre (11,630ft) mountain, also called Vertainspitze, could have been caused by recent snow drifts which had not bonded to the ice below.He said climbing tours were popular and the weather conditions were good, but wondered why the mountaineers were climbing late in the afternoon, as the descent would have then taken until nightfall.The bodies of the three people climbing together were recovered on Saturday before rescue efforts were suspended due to fading light and safety conditions. The Alpine rescue service said that due to fog and low visibility, helicopters could not take off at first light on Sunday.However, once conditions improved, rescuers and avalanche dog units were airlifted to 2,600 metres before setting out on foot.By late morning, the bodies of the two missing mountaineers - the father and daughter - were found.",

    "body": "1 hour agoNicolas Négoce,BBC Africa and Natasha BootyThe military commander who has ruled Guinea since a coup four years ago has entered the presidential race, breaking an earlier promise to hand power to a civilian government.Col Mamadi Doumbouya submitted his candidacy at the Supreme Court on Monday, flanked by soldiers and wearing black sunglasses. He did not make any public comment.Two of Guinea's biggest opposition parties  - RPG Arc en Ciel and UFDG - have been excluded from December's contest.This has raised concerns about the election's credibility.Guineans had reacted with shock last month when it was announced that presidential candidates would need to pay a deposit of 875m Guinean francs ($100,000; £75,000) to contest the election.While the previous deposit was almost as high - 800m francs - some analysts had hoped it would be reduced to encourage more people to stand in these historic elections.‎Four years ago, Col Doumbouya had pledged to hand power back to civilians, saying  \"Neither I nor any member of this transition will be a candidate for anything... As soldiers, we value our word very much.\" ‎‎The election is being held under a new constitution that allowed Col Doumbouya to run for the presidency.Under his rule, the Guinean authorities have been cracking down on peaceful dissent, including attempts to mobilise people towards a return to democratic rule.The junta has been criticised for suspending media outlets, restricting internet access and brutally suppressing demonstrations.Yet Col Doumbouya justified deposing then-83-year-old President Alpha Condé on similar charges - including rampant corruption, disregard for human rights and economic mismanagement.Prior to seizing power in the 2021 coup, Col Doumbouya was a middle-ranking soldier. His 15-year military career included missions in Afghanistan, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Central African Republic and close protection in Israel, Cyprus, the UK and Guinea.Aged 40, he is currently the youngest African head of state.December's election will take place in the absence of several prominent figures - such as ex-President Alpha Condé who was kicked out of power in 2021, and former Prime Ministers Cellou Dalein Diallo and Sidya Touré - all of whom are currently living abroad.

    "body": "12 hours agoDearbail Jordan and David GrittenReuters/Hostages and Missing Families ForumCol Asaf Hamami, Staff Sgt Oz Daniel and Capt Omer Neutra were killed during the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on IsraelIsrael has confirmed the identities of three deceased hostages whose bodies it received from Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza on Sunday.Forensic tests showed the remains were those of Israeli soldiers Col Asaf Hamami, 40, Capt Omer Neutra, 21, and Staff Sgt Oz Daniel, 19, the prime minister's office said.The confirmation means eight dead Israeli and foreign hostages are still in Gaza.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Israel that started more than three weeks ago, Hamas agreed to return all 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on any of the substantive issues in the second phase of the ceasefire deal, including plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and how to organise the reconstruction of a territory left devastated by two years of war.Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, handed over the remains of the three hostages to the Red Cross on Sunday night after saying they had been found \"along the route of one of the tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip\".The bodies were transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza before being transported to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.On Monday morning, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that the remains belonged to Col Hamami, Capt Neutra and Staff Sgt Daniel.\"The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Hamami, Neutra and Daniel families, and all the families of the deceased hostages,\" a statement said.\"The Hamas terrorist organisation is required to uphold its commitments to the mediators and return them as part of the implementation of the agreement. We will not compromise on this and will spare no effort until we return all of the hostages, every last one of them,\" it added.Col Hamami was commander of the Southern Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Gaza Division. The IDF said the father-of-three was among the first troops to reach the combat zones following the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and was \"the first to declare war\". He was killed fighting near Kibbutz Nirim and his body was then taken to Gaza by Hamas as a hostage, it added.Capt Neutra, an Israeli-American dual national who was born in the US and emigrated to Israel, was serving as a platoon commander in the IDF's 7th Brigade. The IDF said he was killed in battle near the Gaza perimeter and that his body was abducted by Hamas.Staff Sgt Daniel was serving in the IDF's 7th Armoured Brigade. He was also killed during a battle with Hamas gunmen near the Gaza perimeter and his body was taken by them as a hostage, according to the IDF.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel, which represents many hostages' relatives, said it \"bows its head in sorrow and shares in the profound grief\" of the three men's families.\"There are no words to express the depth of this pain. The hostages have no time. We must bring them all home, now!\"EPA/ShutterstockHamas has denied Israeli accusations that it is delaying the recovery of the remaining hostages' bodiesHamas and Israel have accused each other of repeated violations of the ceasefire since it took effect on 10 October.On Sunday, an Israeli air strike killed a man in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military said it had struck a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates territory in Gaza still under Israeli control, and was posing a threat to its troops.Under the deal, Hamas agreed to return all the hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has so far handed over the bodies of 225 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 18 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Six of the eight dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "The US is not planning to conduct nuclear explosions, Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said, calming global concerns after President Donald Trump called on the military to resume weapons testing.\"These are not nuclear explosions,\"  Wright told Fox News on Sunday. \"These are what we call non-critical explosions.\"The comments come days after Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had directed defence officials to \"start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis\" with rival powers.But Wright, whose agency oversees testing, said people living in the Nevada desert should have \"no worries\" about seeing a mushroom cloud.\"Americans near historic test sites such as the Nevada National Security Site have no cause for concern,\" Wright said. \"So you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry, and they set up the nuclear explosion.\" Trump's comments on Truth Social last week were interpreted by many as a sign the US was preparing to restart full-scale nuclear blasts for the first time since 1992.In an interview with 60 Minutes on CBS, which was recorded on Friday and aired on Sunday, Trump reiterated his position.\"I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes,\" Trump said when asked by CBS's Norah O'Donnell if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years.\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" he added.Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996 respectively. Pressed further on the topic, Trump said: \"They don't go and tell you about it.\"\"I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test,\" he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.On Monday, China's foreign ministry denied conducting nuclear weapons tests.As a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always... upheld a self-defence nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing\", spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference in Beijing.She added that China hoped the US would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability\".On Thursday, Russia too denied it had carried out nuclear tests.\"Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists, referencing the names of Russian weapons. \"This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test.\"North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear testing since the 1990s - and even Pyongyang announced a moratorium in 2018.The exact number of nuclear warheads held by each country is kept secret in each case - but Russia is thought to have a total of about 5,459 warheads while the US has about 5,177, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).The US-based ACA gives slightly higher estimates, saying America's nuclear stockpile sits at about 5,225 warheads, while Russia has approximately 5,580.China is the world's third largest nuclear power with about 600 warheads, France has 290, the United Kingdom 225, India 180, Pakistan 170, Israel 90 and North Korea 50, the FAS says.According to US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China has roughly doubled its nuclear arsenal in the past five years and is expected to exceed 1,000 weapons by 2030.",

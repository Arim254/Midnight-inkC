    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorLatvian MPs have voted to withdraw from an international accord aimed at protecting women from violence, including domestic abuse, after a long and intense debate in parliament.Several thousand people protested against the vote this week in Riga. It is now up to President Edgars Rinkevics to decide whether to approve the law or not.Known as the Istanbul Convention, the 2011 treaty only came into force in Latvia last year, requiring governments to develop laws and support services to end all violence.Latvia is the first EU country to move towards pulling out of the treaty. Turkey withdrew in 2021, a move described as a huge setback by top human rights body  the Council of Europe.The treaty was ratified by the EU in 2023, however ultra-conservative groups have argued that the accord's focus on gender equality undermines family values and promotes \"gender ideology\".After a 13-hour debate in the Saeima, Latvian MPs voted by 56 to 32 to withdraw from the treaty, in a move sponsored by opposition parties but backed by politicians from one of the three coalition parties, the Union of Greens and Farmers.The result is a setback for centre-right Prime Minister Evika Silina, who joined protesters outside parliament earlier this week. \"We will not give up, we will fight so that violence does not win,\" she told them.One of the main political groups behind the withdrawal is Latvia First, whose leader Ainars Slesers has called on Latvians to choose between a \"natural family\" and a \"gender ideology with multiple sexes\".Latvia's ombudswoman Karina Palkova called for the treaty not to be politicised, and the group Equality Now said it was \"not a threat to Latvian values, it was a tool to realise them\".Thursday's vote has prompted an outcry both within Latvia and beyond. Twenty-two thousand people have signed a Latvian petition not to drop the treaty. Women's rights group Centrs Marta has called a protest next Thursday, accusing MPs of not listening to the Latvian people.The head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, Theodoros Rousopoulos, said Latvia had made a hasty decision fuelled by disinformation. It was, he said, an \"unprecedented and deeply worrying step backwards for women's rights and human rights in Europe\".Since Turkey abandoned the treaty four years ago, femicide and violence against women had risen sharply, he added.As the vote did not win a two-thirds majority, it means the president could return the bill for another reading, if he has objections. President Rinkevics said on X that he would assess the decision under the constitution, \"taking into account state and legal, rather than ideological or political, considerations\".Last week another member of the ruling coalition, the Progressives, said it would not rule out appealing to the Constitutional Court.",

    "body": "4 hours agoCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiIndia and the US have signed a framework agreement to expand defence cooperation over the next 10-years. The pact was announced after a meeting between US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement will enhance \"coordination, information sharing and tech cooperation\" and advance \"regional stability and deterrence\", Hegseth said on X. It comes as the two countries are trying to close a trade deal and tide over tense ties after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariffs on India, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms. The agreement is expected to provide policy direction to the entire spectrum of the India-US defence relationship. \"It is a signal of our growing strategic convergence and will herald a new decade of partnership. Defence will remain as a major pillar of our bilateral relations. Our partnership is critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region,\" Singh said, in a post on X. According to Pramit Pal Chaudhuri of the Eurasia Group think tank, the agreement was supposed to have been concluded in July-August this year, but India's irritation at Trump's statements about his role in ending the conflict with Pakistan led to it getting delayed. The pact is the latest in a series of agreements between the two countries that have made it \"easier for the two militaries to achieve interoperability, India to access technology and the two defence sectors to work together\", Mr Chaudhuri said. \"This provides for further potential in all three areas,\" he added. India and the US have been steadily ramping up their defence ties recently. Defence was a major talking point between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump on the former's visit to the US in February this year, withTrump saying the US would increase military equipment sales to India by many billions of dollars,  ultimately paving the way to providing Delhi with F-35 stealth warplanes.But since then, Delhi's dependence on discounted Russian oil as well as its long-standing defence relationship with Moscow have been a major point of irritation for the Trump administration. While Russia continues to be a major supplier of arms to India, its share of Indian defence imports has been steadily falling as Delhi seeks to diversify its portfolio and boost domestic capacity.In recent months India has hinted that it would be open to increasing energy and defence purchases from the US. The two countries are locked in high-stakes trade talks, aimed at reaching a long-awaited deal by November. With inputs from Soutik Biswas, India correspondent with the BBC.",

    "body": "The Sagrada Família has become the tallest church in the world, after workers placed the first part of a cross at the top of its central tower. Now measuring 162.91 metres tall, the Spanish basilica has officially pipped the record from the Ulm Minster in Germany, which has held the crown since 1890.Designed by acclaimed architect Antoni Gaudí, the place of worship has been under construction in the centre of Barcelona for more than a century, with the main building due to be completed next year. The central Tower of Jesus Christ will grow with the addition of the rest of the cross over the next few months, eventually standing at 172 metres tall. The first stone of the Sagrada Família was placed in 1882, with up-and-coming architect Gaudí taking over the project the following year. He transformed the original designs for the basilica into a far more ambitious proposal, which was initially funded by donations from repentant worshippers. At the time of his unexpected death in 1926, just one of the planned 18 towers had been built.In the years following, the construction of the architectural marvel was managed by the Sagrada Família foundation, and funded by contributions from tourists, visitors and private donors.In addition to the death of its primary architect, the basilica has hit a number of roadblocks throughout its almost 150-year construction. During the Spanish Civil War, Catalan anarchists set fire to the crypt, destroying plans and plaster models created by Gaudí that would guide future construction.Most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic saw construction on the building halted, with members of the foundation attributing the pause to a lack of tourism, and the subsequent drop in funding for the project.In September this year, Sagrada Família General Director Xavier Martínez told the Associated Press that the Tower of Jesus Christ would be completed in 2026, to coincide with the centenary of Gaudí's death.The foundation will hold a series of events to commemorate the architect, who is buried in the church's crypt.Work on decorative details, sculptures and a stairway leading to the building's main entrance is expected to continue over the next decade.",

    "body": "19 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentThe commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces has warned Russian activity is increasing around the key frontline town of Pokrovsk, saying \"the situation is difficult\".General Oleksandr Syrskyi admitted Russian infantry was massing in the area and said he had visited the frontline himself for talks with key commanders.But he said reports that Ukrainian troops had been \"blockaded\" there by Russian forces was \"untrue\" propaganda.There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town in the Donetsk region in the east of Ukraine. It forms a key transport and supply hub and its capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.In a statement on Telegram, General Syrskyi said: \"In Pokrovsk, enemy infantry, avoiding combat, is amassing in the urban area and changing locations, so the primary objective is to identify and destroy them.\"He added: \"The situation is difficult, but Russian propaganda claims about the alleged 'blockade' of the Ukrainian Defence Forces in Pokrovsk, as well as in Kupiansk, are untrue.\"He said commanders were having to maintain \"a reasonable balance between goals and capabilities.\"\"The main priority is preserving the lives of our soldiers,\" he added.Russian forces have been trying to seize Pokrovsk for more than a year. Taking it would give them a path towards taking the two biggest cities still controlled by Ukraine in the region - Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Russia's chief of general staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, claimed earlier this week Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk had been surrounded.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Pokrovsk was \"the main target\" for Russia whose forces there, he said, outnumbered Ukrainians by eight to one.He told reporters Russia wanted to take the town to convince the United States that Ukraine was on the run.\"They do not have a result they can 'sell' to the Americans. We understand why they need Pokrovsk. They need it only to claim that Ukraine withdraws from the east and gives everything else they want,\" Zelensky said.In its latest assessment, the defence intelligence firm, Sybelline, said the battle for Pokrovsk \"has entered a highly dynamic and intense phase, as the Russian forces intensify their efforts to infiltrate the city and encircle Ukrainian defenders\".Deepstate, a Ukrainian monitoring group, said Russian forces were \"gradually engulfing\" Pokrovsk \"with [their] sheer number of personnel\". It said Russian troops were infiltrating deeper into the town and disrupting Ukrainian supply routes. \"The situation in Pokrovsk is on the brink of crisis and continues to deteriorate, to the point where it may be too late to fix everything,\" the group concluded.",

    "body": "A Japanese superhero series that inspired the hugely popular Power Rangers TV and movie franchise from the 1990s is ending after 50 years, local media report.Super Sentai will go off air as sales from merchandise and events have not been enough to cover production costs, reports say. Its broadcaster TV Asahi declined to comment on \"future programming\", according to the Asahi newspaper.The series premiered in 1975 and its formula - five teens who transform into colourful masked fighters to battle aliens - served as the blueprint for Power Rangers in the US and many other superhero shows that aired in Asia.It also served as a launchpad for the careers of many Japanese actors.Super Sentai was much more than a TV series. The show that aired weekly was essentially an advertisement for toys, clothes, costumes and collectibles.For animation and toy fans outside Japan, it served as a gateway to the country's colourful superhero and comic book culture.Similar shows like Choudenshi Bioman and Hikari Sentai Maskman were dubbed in English and developed cult followings in the Philippines.In the Super Sentai series, the superhero team, made up of three men and two women, is led by a fighter in a red suit - as in Power Rangers. The rest of team is colour-coded, green or black for the second-in-command, followed by blue, yellow and pink.Every episode also followed the same sequence - starting with martial arts and swordfights and ending with a battle between their robot spaceship and a giant alien in the end. A large part of its appeal is the live-action animation, which in the 1980s and 1990s bordered on crude.The original Power Rangers series aired on US TV from 1993 to 1996 and there have been multiple spin-offs. The episodes are now streamed on YouTube.Producer Haim Saban, who adapted Power Rangers from the Japanese original, said in a 2017 interview with the LA Times that the concept was a tough sell at first.\"Every selling season, I would go out and offer it to the networks - and would get kicked out of the room... They told me how crazy I was,\" he said.News of Super Sentai's demise drew sadness from fans and celebrities.Popular actress Keiko Kitagawa re-posted a news article on the reported cancellation with the caption \"despair\". Her post on X was viewed 15 million times.Yasuhisa Furuhara, an actor who played one of the Super Sentai fighters, noted how the series ran for half a century. \"I'm proud to be a part of history,\" he said on X.One fan on X said his parents had watched Super Sentai when they were children. And that he is watching the current series. \"I'll miss it... What a shame.\"\"Super Sentai is coming to an end, so what should boys watch from now on?\" another fan said.",

    "body": "US space agency Nasa has rejected reality star Kim Kardashian's claim that the 1969 space mission to land the first man on the Moon was faked.\"Yes, we've been to the Moon before... 6 times!\" Nasa acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote on social media.Kardashian made the comments on the latest episode of her long-running TV series The Kardashians, telling co-star Sarah Paulson she thought the Moon landing \"didn't happen\".Despite being consistently debunked, conspiracy theories as to whether humans actually reached the Moon have persisted for more than 50 years, particularly with the rise of social media. In the episode, Kardashian can be seen showing Paulson an interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who along with Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission.\"I'm sending you a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and the other one,\" Kardashian says, before reading a quote allegedly from Aldrin responding to a question about the scariest moment of the expedition.\"There was no scary moment because it didn't happen. It could've been scary, but it wasn't because it didn't happen,\" she reads.It is unclear which article Kardashian was reading from, or if the quotes were actually from Aldrin.Moments later, the reality star is seen telling a producer \"I centre conspiracies all the time\", adding that she believes the Moon landing was fake.\"I think it was fake. I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen. He says it all the time now, in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin,\" she says.Following the broadcast, Duffy tagged Kardashian in a post on X, rebuffing her comments, and promoted Nasa's current moon exploration program Artemis, which is \"going back under the leadership\" of Donald Trump.\"We won the last space race and we will win this one too,\" he added.In response, Kardashian wrote back asking about the interstellar object named 3I/Atlas, which astronomers said could be the oldest comet ever seen.\"Wait…. what's the tea on 3I Atlas?!?!!!!!!!?????\" she replied.Duffy later invited Kardashian to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the Artemis mission to the moon.For  decades, scientists and experts have rebutted conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo 11 mission was a hoax.\"Every single argument claiming that Nasa faked the Moon landings has been discredited,\" according to the Institute of Physics.",

    "body": "14 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterReutersApple boss Tim Cook holds an iPhone 17 pro and an iPhone Air, as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, California, US September 9, 2025.The latest iPhones have seen \"a tremendous response\" across the globe, said Apple boss Tim Cook as the tech giant released its latest financial results.The firm unveiled its thinnest iPhone, the Air, in September, along with upgraded iPhone 17 models, proving a bumper crop for the firm.It said it expects the upcoming Christmas and New Year's period to be a blockbuster, forecasting overall revenue to be up to 12% higher than the same period last year.But Apple narrowly missed estimates for iPhone sales in its fourth quarter that ended in September, which boss Tim Cook blamed on supply constraints for several iPhone models along with a lag in shipments to China.Despite that, during a call with analysts Mr Cook said Apple is heading into the holiday season \"with our most powerful lineup ever\".The iPhone Air helped entice customers and boost sales.If the company meets its sales forecast for the holiday season, it would be Apple's \"best quarter ever\", chief financial officer Kevan Parekh told analysts on Thursday.Apple reported overall fourth quarter revenue of $102.5bn (£77bn), topping analysts' estimates and representing an 8% increase from the previous year. But iPhone revenue, specifically, came in slightly below expectations at $49bn (£37bn).Mr Cook stressed that global demand for iPhone 16 and 17 models has been robust, despite constraints that led to the sales miss in the recent quarter. \"We're not predicting when the supply and demand will balance,\" Mr Cook said. \"We're obviously working very hard to achieve that, because we want to get as many of these products out to customers as possible.\"In the Chinese market, he said he \"couldn't be more pleased with how things are going\", citing strong reception to the new iPhone 17.Data from Counterpoint, a technology market research firm, showed that the first 10 days of iPhone 17 sales in the US and China were up 14% compared with sales of the iPhone 16.The effects of US President Donald Trump's tariffs also remain top of mind for Apple's investors. It manufactures many iPhones in China and its global supply chain leaves it vulnerable to trade wars - though a recent meeting between Trump and President Xi raised hopes for a de-escalation of tensions.Mr Cook on Thursday told analysts that the company took at $1.1bn (£836m) hit from tariffs in the recently ended quarter. He said the hit will likely amount to another $1.4bn in the holiday quarter as Trump imposes taxes on those whom he sees as \"unfavourable\" to the US economy.Amazon, which also reported quarterly results on Thursday, projected sales to land between $206bn (£156bn) and $213bn (£161bn) for the current quarter through December, largely in line with analysts' expectations.\"We're encouraged by the start of the peak season,\" Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, told analysts.Amazon also said that revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business, rose 20% in the third quarter from the previous year - its fastest pace since 2022.For investors, that AI-driven growth could come as a reassurance, as Apple faces fierce competition in the race to dominate the AI boom.Apple's stock has lagged behind that of rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, both of whom on Wednesday reaffirmed their commitment to spending big on the technology. Those firms have reported even faster growth than Amazon in their cloud computing businesses.\"We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity,\" Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, said in a statement.",

    "description": "On Wednesday, over tea and cakes with veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\"There is nothing",
    "body": "On Wednesday, over tea and cakes with veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\"There is nothing like this,\" the Russian leader said of the Poseidon - a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable underwater drone that can be fired like a torpedo and which a senior Russian MP said could \"put entire states out of operation\". When it was first unveiled in 2018, Russian media said the Poseidon would be able to achieve a speed of 200km/h (120mph) and travel in a \"constantly changing route\" that would make it impossible to intercept.Putin's claim came only days after the announcement that Moscow had conducted a test of its \"unlimited-range\" Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile. It's \"a unique product, unmatched in the world\", Putin said of the Burevestnik, noting the missile was so new \"we are yet to identify what it is, what class of weapons [it] belongs to\".It is not unusual for Russia to test and flaunt weapons.And, despite the boisterous nature of Russian announcements, their military value is ambiguous.\"They are basically Armageddon weapons - too powerful to be used unless you're happy to destroy the world,\" Mark Galeotti, a Russia scholar and long-time observer of Russian politics, told the BBC.Both the Poseidon and the Burevestnik are second-strike, retaliatory weapons, Mr Galeotti added - and not even the most rabid Kremlin propagandists are suggesting anyone is preparing to launch strikes on Russia. It is also unclear whether the weapons are actually viable. In 2019, five Russian nuclear engineers died in a rocket engine explosion which some Russian and Western experts said was linked to the Burevestnik.Two years later, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) - a London-based think tank specialising in global conflict and security - noted that Russia faced \"considerable technical challenges\" in ensuring \"the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit\" of the missile.Neither the Poseidon nor the Burevestnik were entirely novel - both had first been presented to the world in 2018 as part of a new array of weapons that Putin called \"invincible\".So it is the timing of the announcements - rather than their contents - which could be noteworthy. After a whirlwind few months of tentative diplomacy by US President Donald Trump to try and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Trump appears to have cooled off on the endeavour to end the war. Last week, the White House cancelled a summit between Trump and Putin, apparently after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio realised the gulf between Moscow and Washington's positions was too great for a high-level meeting to achieve meaningful results.Not only is there no suggestion of any further talks, but soon after the meeting was cancelled, Trump imposed sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil producers as punishment for Moscow's failure to agree on a peace deal in Ukraine.And while his relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seems to still be fraught, it appears Trump is growing irritated with Moscow's intractability.So Putin may be vying for Trump's attention. \"In the face of Trump blowing hot and cold with his support for Ukraine or sympathy to Russia, here is an element in which Moscow has bigger cards than Kyiv,\" Mr Galeotti argued. \"So in that context [successful weapons tests] are more about keeping him thinking Russia is indeed powerful.\"Another clue could come from the battlefield in Ukraine. Three-and-a-half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, its troops continue to merely grind on - at great cost in human life and resources - with no obvious breakthrough likely any time soon.\"We are getting towards the end of summer fighting season in Ukraine and it has not gone very well for the Russians,\" said David Heathcote, head of intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services.The announcements about the Burevestnik and the Poseidon should be seen as a reflection of the weakness of their conventional forces, Mr Heathcote told the BBC. Russia is not formally part of any military alliances that would serve as a deterrent if it is on the back foot, and its army is tied up and under pressure in Ukraine. In these cases, Mr Heathcote says, \"the Russians always react with unnecessary and overexaggerated sabre rattling\".While Moscow's decision to publicly announce the Burevestnik and Poseidon tests may have been influenced by this, it seems the claim has already had the tangible effect of provoking Trump into instructing its military to resume nuclear weapons testing.Trump justified the move as a way of keeping pace with other countries such as Russia and China. \"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said - although it will likely take several months for the US to restart nuclear tests after a 33-year pause.The Kremlin's reaction to Trump's statement was quickPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov questioned whether the US president had been correctly informed. The Russian tests \"cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test\", Peskov said. Trump did not elaborate on the kind of tests he wanted the US to resume.It was likely, said IISS Head of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control Dr Alexander Bollfrass, that Trump's decision was a direct response to the Russian test of the Burevestnik and that the US could be planning to conduct similar flight tests of US Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.

    "body": "Protesters have taken to the streets in Tanzania for a third day, defying warnings from the country's army chief to end the unrest.Demonstrations have been taking place in major cities with young protesters denouncing Wednesday's election as unfair as key opposition figures were excluded from contesting against President Samia Suluhu Hassan.An internet shutdown remains in place, making it difficult to confirm reports of deaths, and the authorities have extended a curfew in a bid to quell the protests.The UN has called on the East African nation's security forces to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force.\"We are alarmed by the deaths and injuries that have occurred in the ongoing election-related protests in Tanzania. Reports we have received indicate that at least 10 people were killed,\" Reuters quoted the UN human rights spokesperson Seif Magango as saying, citing \"credible sources\".Amnesty International in Kenya told the BBC that with communications down in neighbouring Tanzania the rights group was not able to confirm reports of deaths.Hospitals in the country are refusing to give information to journalists or human rights groups when asked about causalities.The government has sought to play down the scale of the violence.The electoral commission has announced results from more than half of the country's total 100 constituencies, the state broadcaster, TBC, shows.A coronation not a contest - Tanzania's first female president faces little oppositionWhy elections are a time of fear for albino TanzaniansHow Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political angerPresident Samia is expected to win the vote under the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, which has governed the country since independence in 1961.Official results are expected on Saturday. Tanzania's chief Muslim cleric - Sheikh Abubakar Zubeir bin Ally - has urged Muslims to perform Friday prayers at home amid fears of escalating violence.On Thursday, army chief Gen Jacob John Mkunda ordered the protesters off the streets, saying the military would work with other security agencies to contain the situation.\"Some people went to the streets on 29 October and committed criminal acts. These are criminals and the criminal acts should be stopped immediately,\" Gen Mkunda said on state TV, adding that the army had \"controlled the situation\".But the protesters have again taken to the streets of the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. On Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar - which elects its own government and leader - the CCM's Hussein Mwinyi, who is the incumbent president, has won with nearly 80% of the vote.The opposition in Zanzibar said there had been \"massive fraud\", the AP news agency reported. Tourists on the archipelago are also reported to be stranded at the airport, with flight delays because of the protests, which have been on the mainland.The protesters accuse the government of undermining democracy, as the main opposition leader is in jail and another opposition figure was disqualified from the election, bolstering Samia's chances of winning.Tundu Lissu, the main opposition leader, is in jail on treason charges, which he denies, and his party boycotted the vote.The only other serious contender, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party, was disqualified on legal technicalities.Sixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, were cleared to contest the elections.Samia took office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.She was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed, with her government accused of targeting critics through arrests and a wave of abductions.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPumza Fihlani,BBC Africa, Johannesburg and Wycliffe MuiaA South African court has ruled that Nobel laureate Albert Luthuli's 1967 death was the result of an \"assault\" by apartheid police, overturning decades of claims that it was an accident.An inquest held under the apartheid government concluded that Luthuli, the first African to win the Nobel Peace Prize, died after being struck by a freight train while walking along a railway line.But activists and his family had long cast doubt on the findings, and South Africa's government reopened the case this year. A judge on Thursday ruled that the anti-apartheid hero died as a result of a fractured skull and a cerebral haemorrhage associated with an assault. His family has welcomed the judgement.Luthuli, who at the time of his death was the leader of the then-banned African National Congress (ANC), won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960 for spearheading the fight against apartheid.Ghosts of apartheid haunt South Africa as compensation anger brewsSouth Africa's long wait for justice over apartheid crimesThe ANC went on to lead the struggle against white-minority rule and came to power in 1994, following the first democratic elections.South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority in April reopened fresh investigations into Luthuli's death as family and activists suspected the apartheid authorities had killed him and covered it up. Delivering the judgment on Thursday, Judge Nompumelelo Radebe said evidence presented at the reopened inquest did not support the 1967 inquest findings. \"It is found that the deceased died as a result of a fractured skull, cerebral haemorrhage and concussion of the brain associated with an assault,\" Judge Nompumelelo ruled.The judge said Luthuli's death was attributable to \"assault by members of the security special branch of the South African police, acting in concert and in common purpose with employees of the South African Railway Company\".She named seven men, whose whereabouts could \"not be ascertained\", as having committed or being complicit in the murder. If found, they could face criminal charges. After the judgment was read out, the Luthuli family's spokesperson called it \"the first part of finally getting justice\".ANC national spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu also welcomed the court's decision, which she said \"corrected a long-standing distortion of history\".\"This ruling brings justice, truth and dignity to the memory of one of South Africa's greatest sons and to all those who suffered under apartheid brutality,\" Bhengu added. The case at the Pietermaritzburg High Court is the latest in renewed efforts by South African authorities to deliver justice for victims of apartheid-era crimes and closure for their families.Last month, South Africa prosecutors reopened the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko, who died in police custody in 1977 after being tortured.In May, President Cyril Ramaphosa established a judicial commission of inquiry to look into allegations of improper influence in delaying or hindering the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDavid GrittenJerusalemReutersThe Israeli military said Sahar Baruch (L) and Amiram Cooper (R) were killed by their captorsIsrael has confirmed the identities of two deceased hostages whose bodies it received from Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza on Thursday.Forensic tests showed the remains were those of Amiram Cooper, 84, and Sahar Baruch, 25, the Israeli prime minister's office said.\"The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Cooper and [Baruch] families and all the families of the fallen hostages,\" it said in a statement.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel demanded that all 11 Israeli and foreign deceased hostages still in Gaza be returned immediately by Hamas in line with the US-brokered ceasefire agreement.Amiram Cooper was abducted along with his wife, Nurit, from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which sparked the war. Hamas released Nurit after 17 days, but it continued to hold Amiram.The Israeli military said it estimated Amiram was murdered in captivity in February 2024, but that final conclusions will be made upon completion of a post-mortem.It had previously said he was killed along with three other hostages - Nadav Popplewell, Chaim Peri and Yoram Metzger - in Khan Younis while troops were operating in the area. Hamas had claimed they were killed by an Israeli strike.Sahar Baruch was kidnapped during the attack on Kibbutz Be'eri by Hamas gunmen, who also killed his brother, Edan, and grandmother, Geula Bachar.The Israeli military said it estimated that he was murdered in captivity on 8 December 2023, and that it was awaiting the results of a post-mortem.It had previously announced that he was killed during a rescue attempt by Israeli forces.The military expressed its deep condolences to the two men's families and stressed that Hamas was \"required to fulfil its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to a dignified burial\".The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents many hostages' families, said: \"There are no words to express the depth of this pain.\"\"The hostages have no time. We must bring them all home, now!\"On Friday morning, Israeli authorities returned via the Red Cross the bodies of another 30 dead Palestinians in exchange for the two hostages, Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said.Under the ceasefire deal, Israel has agreed to hand over the remains of 15 Palestinians for every deceased Israeli hostage. Israeli prime minister's officeIsraeli soldiers salute the coffins, which were handed over by Hamas via the Red Cross in GazaOn Tuesday, the Israeli government accused Hamas of violating the Gaza ceasefire deal after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased Israeli and foreign hostages then still in Gaza.It said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage whose body had been recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023.The Israeli military also released footage filmed by a drone that showed Hamas members removing a body bag containing the remains from a building in Gaza City, reburying it, and then staging the discovery in front of Red Cross staff.The Red Cross said its staff were unaware that the body bag had been moved before their arrival and that the staged recovery was \"unacceptable\".Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".Hours later, the Israeli government accused Hamas of another ceasefire violation, saying the group's fighters had killed an Israeli soldier in an attack in an area of southern Gaza.Hamas claimed it was not involved in the incident in the Rafah area, but Israel's prime minister ordered a wave of air strikes across Gaza on Tuesday night in response. The Israeli military said it attacked \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\".Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 104 Palestinians were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, making it the deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.US President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire agreement, which his administration brokered along with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, but he added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.EPAOn Tuesday, Hamas fighters removed a body bag from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Khan YounisUnder the deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 225 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 15 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Nine of the 11 dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, in which more than 68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSuranjana Tewari,Asia Business Correspondent in Gyeongju and Osmond Chia,Business reporterUS chip giant Nvidia will supply more than 260,000 of its most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to South Korea's government, as well as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai.The companies will all deploy the AI chips in factories to make everything from semiconductors and robots to autonomous vehicles and meant that South Korea can \"now produce intelligence as a new export,\" chief executive Jensen Huang said.Mr Huang did not disclose the value of the South Korean deals.It caps off a busy week for Nvidia, which on Wednesday became the first company to be valued at $5 trillion and on Thursday saw signs of a thaw in US-China trade relations that may mean it can export more of its chips to China .Speaking at a CEO summit on the sidelines of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) in Gyeongju, South Korea, Mr Huang added that with the chips, companies would be able to create \"digital twins\" with other factories around the world.These deals form part of Nvidia's latest effort to expand AI infrastructure globally, to further integrate AI into products and services.Nvidia has been striking international partnerships which helped it become the first company ever to be valued at $5tn (£3.8tn) on Wednesday.The South Korea deals come as Nvidia grapples with the fallout of the China-US trade war.China made up more than a tenth of Nvidia's revenue last year, but the extent of China's access to Nvidia's chips has been a point of friction with Washington.\"We used to have 95% share of the AI business in China. Now we're at 0% share. And I'm disappointed by that,\" Huang said in Gyeongju on Friday.Trump said after his meeting with Xi on Thursday that Beijing will hold talks with Nvidia to discuss sales of its chips in China.Trump said the talks remained between China and the US company, but that the US government will play the role of a \"referee\" of sorts.On Friday, Huang said he would like to sell Nvidia's state-of-the-art Blackwell chips to China, although the decision needed to be made by the US President.The US imposes export controls on sales to China of Nvidia's most-advanced AI chips.The tech boss had no news on China sales, or the talks between the two leaders but that he hopes they'll find a way to have new policies that allow chips back into China. \"It's in the best interest of America to have the China market and it's in China's interest to have an American company bring technology to the country,\" Huang said.\"We'd like to see American technology be the global standard.\"South Korea - which is already home to major semiconductor companies and vehicle manufacturers - wants to become a regional AI hub.The country is the ideal place to expand AI infrastructure, according to the Nvidia CEO, because of its access to energy and land, and its ability to construct factories. President Lee Jae Myung said he would prioritise AI investment after coming into office in the face of US tariffs.With the Nvidia deal, the South Korean government plans to build computing infrastructure that it will control, a term known as \"sovereign AI\". More than 50,000 Nvidia chips will power data centres at the National AI Computing Center and facilities owned by South Korean companies like Kakao and Naver.The chip giant is dependent on the tightly-knit supply chains that run through the Asia Pacific region.Nvidia is primarily a chip designer, and so outsources most of its physical production to manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix and TSMC.TSMC has been a critical partner for Nvidia, making the company's most advanced AI chips, including its flagship Blackwell series.Samsung makes parts for Nvidia's H20 chips, a scaled-down processor made for the Chinese market under US export rules.National security experts and some politicians have long voiced concerns about the US selling AI chips to China, saying that Beijing could use them to gain an advantage in AI, as well as in military applications.Analysts say that US efforts to block China's access to advanced computer chips have fostered innovation within China.Both Huawei and Alibaba have unveiled their own chips that they say can rival Nvidia's products for the Chinese market.Beijing has also reportedly prohibited local firms from buying from Nvidia, urging them to buy from Chinese chipmakers to give its domestic tech industry a boost.\"We respect deeply the capabilities of China,\" Nvidia's Jensen Huang said on Friday.Nvidia's share price was this week further boosted by a wave of new deals, including partnerships with the US Department of Energy, Nokia, Uber, and Stellantis - moves aimed at reassuring investors that AI investments will deliver returns.Hopes of a revival in China sales, following trade talks between Presidents Trump and Xi, also lifted its share price.Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar",

    "body": "Trump caps refugee admissions at record low - with most to be white South Africans10 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseThe Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.The move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.No reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was \"justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest\".In January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety. The previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.The notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years. The tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.The South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.Watch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turnOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".The US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups. Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in USIs there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Some have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East. \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\" \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added. Refugees International also slammed the move, saying it \"makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values\".\"Let us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status – they are not fleeing systematic persecution,\" Refugees International said in its statement.The South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement. During the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".Earlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. While the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. ",

    "body": "'Can't go back' - families in violence-hit Indian state fear resettlement deadline12 hours agoJugal PurohitBBC HindiMidhat Ullah HasaniChingakham Radha has moved to a temporary shelter but longs to return home Thousands of people displaced by ethnic clashes in India's north-eastern state of Manipur two years ago now face an uncertain future, as the government plans to shut down all temporary relief camps by December.The violence, which erupted in May 2023 between the majority Meitei and the indigenous Kuki communities, was the worst the region had witnessed in decades.It started after protests by the largely Christian Kuki community against the Meiteis, mostly Hindus, who were demanding official tribal status that would grant them access to the same government benefits and job quotas as other tribes, including Kukis.At least 260 people were killed in the clashes and around 60,000 displaced people have since been living in temporary shelters.Over the past two years, the government has made repeated promises to rehabilitate the displaced, but little has changed on the ground. Many say their lives remain in a limbo - effectively homeless and without a steady source of income.Anxieties grew further in July when the state's then Chief Secretary Prashant Singh announced that all relief camps would be shut down by December and its residents would be resettled.He added that those unable to return to their homes would be relocated to pre-fabricated housing units. The government, however, did not clarify where these units would be - whether near the relief camps or near displaced people's original homes  - worsening their concerns about future. Uncertainty grew in September when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his first visit to Manipur since the violence began, announced that 7,000 new homes would be built to resettle the displaced in \"appropriate locations\" without giving any other details. Midhat Ullah HasaniThousands are still living in relief camps in the hilly Churachandpur regionOn the ground, Manipur remains sharply divided: the Meiteis inhabit the Imphal Valley, while the Kukis live in the surrounding hill districts; and security forces continue to patrol the buffer zones that separate the two communities.A security official deployed in the area told BBC Hindi that his mandate was to \"ensure that Meiteis and Kukis remain in their respective areas and do not mix\".Experts say resettling people in their original neighbourhoods is crucial to prevent the violence from redrawing Manipur's social map.\"This is not good for a secular, democratic India. Resettling them in their original homes is most critical,\" said RK Nimai Singh, former secretary to the Manipur governor.He added that many displaced people feared that if they left the relief camps and moved into temporary housing, they might never be able to return to their homes. It's a thought that haunts Hatnu Haokip. For her, home means only one place - Imphal valley - and she yearns to go back. \"But that can't happen because our village is now surrounded by Meitei people,\" said the 22-year-old who is now living in a relief camp in the hilly Churachandpur regionMs Haokip added that she would feel safer if Kuki leaders were given autonomy to set up a separate federally-administered territory for the community. This sentiment was echoed by several other Kukis, who also feel apprehensive of returning to their homes. On the other hand, most Meiteis BBC Hindi spoke to said they wanted to go back home. Irom Abung, who once ran a water supply business in Churachandpur, now lives in a relief camp near a buffer zone.His house was damaged during the violence, but Mr Abung says he will never give up on the place he once called home.\"My land remains. I will never sell it because I know I will return one day,\" he said. \"Efforts must be made to bridge the gap between our two communities so people can go back to their lives.\"The unease, coupled with uncertainty over where the new homes will be built, has raised doubts over whether the government would be able to close all relief camps by December.Government officials, however, insist that the resettlement plan is on track.\"From about 290 camps initially, we've brought the number down to around 260,\" a senior Manipur government official said.\"Eventually, we want to resettle people in the areas from where they fled, once they feel safe to return.\"The official added that while they understood people's concerns, it was also in the state's interest for them to return home - otherwise, the divisions would only grow deeper.Midhat Ullah HasaniMany women in the relief camps are crocheting and selling dolls to earn a little extra income to support their familiesAs tens of thousands of people continue to live in relief camps, many complain about not getting the facilities the government promised them.Nemhoichong Lhungdim, a single mother, said her 11-year-old son had suffered a debilitating eye injury a few months back and has lost sight in one eye.After government doctors failed to help, she borrowed money to take him to a private hospital, but was unable to afford the treatment.\"I was told it would cost about 300,000 rupees ($3,400; £2,600). I don't have that kind of money,\" she said.Ms Lhungdim says the government sometimes organises health camps, but they have never treated her son. BBC Hindi has reached out to officials for a response.Inside the camps, residents say prolonged displacement and uncertainty are also taking a toll on people's mental health.Salam Monika, 25, says her uncle took his own life last year after being driven to despair by a lack of livelihood opportunities. She says the family could not access medical help.\"Some mental health workers visited our camp a few times since 2023, but this year, they haven't come at all,\" she said.BBC Hindi has reached out to the government for comment.Meanwhile, those moved from camps into temporary housing say that while they now have a roof over their heads, they still struggle to make ends meet as livelihood remains a concern.Chingakham Radha, one of the newly resettled residents, said she learned to make crochet dolls while living in the camp and now earns a small income from selling them. \"The money is very little, just enough to get by,\" she said.Before the conflict, Ms Radha was a homemaker and her husband worked as a labourer. They were not wealthy, but had a happy life.Thinking about those days, Ms Radha says life has become uncertain now. \"Some days my husband finds work, but other times weeks go by without any work,\" she said. \"I want to return home to Churachandpur, but those hopes are fading with time.\"Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

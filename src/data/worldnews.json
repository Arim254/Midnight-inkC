    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge1 day agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"Back in Columbia University, those years ago, the student from Pakistan had asked me a question. \"Don't you find it interesting,\" he said, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "7 hours agoThomas MackintoshEPASince 8 January families have been spending the night outside the El Rodeo jail in ZamoraA leading Venezuelan human rights group says at least 80 political prisoners have been released under pressure from the US.Alfredo Romero, head of Foro Penal, said his group was verifying the identities of those freed from prisons across the country on Saturday - and more releases were likely to take place.It is the latest batch of detainees released since the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a raid, and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges earlier this month.On Friday Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez said more than 600 prisoners had been freed - but Foro Penal says this figure has been inflated.Romero announced the releases on social media. He also posted an image of Foro Penal colleague Kennedy Tejeda who he said had been held in Tocorón prison, west of the capital caracas since August 2024.In a post on X, Foro Penal lawyer Gonzalo Himiob said the number of releases could rise above 80 \"as we proceed with verification\".Previously, Foro Penal said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped.This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group said.Before this weekend's developments, the group had confirmed the release of just 156 political prisoners since 8 January.Some domestic opposition figures and at least five Spanish nationals are among those confirmed to have been freed so far.Separately, Rodriguez said she was due to have a call on Monday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, to ask the UN to verify the lists of those released so far.Human rights groups and activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle critics. The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.",

    "body": "1 day agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringUkraine is now living through its most difficult winter in recent memory. With January temperatures plummeting below -15C, Russia has been attacking energy infrastructure, leaving about a million Ukrainians without heating.The capital, Kyiv, is the main target of such attacks. Following the latest Russian bombardment overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. \"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. \"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that.\" She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing.What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators.Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons.In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers.Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing.The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as \"panelki\", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as \"khrushchevki\", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s.Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for \"heat and electricity centrals\" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat.Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as \"private houses\" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities.\"Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised,\" Korolchuk told the BBC. \"These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war.\"According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia.\"During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, Nyaungshwe, Shan state andJosh CheethamPolls in Myanmar have closed after a third and final stage of voting in what are widely viewed as sham elections.Many popular parties are banned from standing and voting has not been possible in large areas of the country because of a five-year-long civil war.The dominant party backed by the ruling military junta is expected to win a landslide victory.The current regime has rejected international criticism of the election, maintaining that it is free and fair.Around one-fifth of the country's 330 townships, including the cities of Yangon and Mandalay, voted in the last stage. Six parties, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), fielded candidates nationwide, while another 51 parties and independent candidates decided to contest state and regional levels.Two previous rounds were held on 28 December and 11 January - giving overwhelming victories to the USDP.The party won only 6% of parliamentary seats in the last free election in 2020.As in previous rounds of this strange, month-long election, voting was orderly and peaceful at the polling station in Nyaungshwe, Shan State, which a BBC team observed. Set in a large school, shaded by huge rain trees, there were ample volunteers an officials to guide voters where to go, and how to make their choice using the new, locally-made electronic voting machines. You could be forgiven for believing this was a normal democratic exercise, not the sham its critics say it is.However polling day was preceded by a campaigning period marked by fear, intimidation and a pervasive sense that little will change after the inevitable victory by the USDP. Everywhere the BBC team travelled in southern Shan State, we were followed and closely monitored by dozens of police and military officials, always polite but very persistent. It proved nearly impossible to get people to say anything about the vote, so nervous were they of possible repercussions.The next steps after final results are announced are laid down in the military-drafted constitution. Parliament will meet within the next two months to choose a new president, and everyone expects that to be the coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing. It will be the same regime with civilian clothes. But he will then have to relinquish his command of the armed forces. His replacement is certain to be a loyalist, but his hold over the ranks of the military will inevitably be less secure, and it is no secret that many other senior officers do not believe he has made a good job of leading the country. With many more voices in politics, there is the possibility of wider debate inside government over which direction Myanmar should now take, and the possibility - distant for now - of the first steps towards ending the civil war.The military junta took control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup, ousting an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi.She remains in detention and, like many other opposition groups, her National League for Democracy has been formally dissolved.The military has been fighting against both armed resistance groups which oppose the coup and ethnic armies that have their own militias. It lost control of large parts of the country in a series of major setbacks, but clawed back territory this year enabled by support from China and Russia.The civil war has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more, destroyed the economy and left a humanitarian vacuum. A devastating earthquake in March and international funding cuts have made the situation far worse.",

    "body": "10 hours agoThomas MackintoshReutersThe Grinch was intercepted by the French navy on ThursdayFrench officials have taken the Indian captain of a suspected Russian shadow fleet tanker into custody days after the oil tanker was seized.On Thursday, the French navy intercepted the tanker - named the Grinch - which President Emmanuel Macron said was \"subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag\".The Grinch had been travelling through the Mediterranean Sea from the Russian Arctic port of Murmansk. It is now moored, under guard, at a southern French port near Marseille.Although Moscow is yet to comment, Macron said on Thursday that the shadow fleet helped to \"finance Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine\".The office of the Marseille prosecutor office said the rest of the ship's crew members - all also Indians - were being \"kept on board\" while the 58-year-old captain was taken into custody.\"The investigation aims to verify the validity of the flag used by the tanker,\" prosecutors said. French media report say it was sailing under a Comoros Islands flag.  Nautical and air exclusion zones have been established around the anchorage site, officials say.French Joint Staff of the Armed ForcesSoldiers searched the vessel after it was seized in the MediterraneanAnnouncing the seizure on Thursday, Macron said: \"We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions.\"Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia.Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later.Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil.Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.More on this story",

    "body": "13 hours agoJacob PhillipsFamily handoutAlex Pretti was killed in Minneapolis on SaturdayA man who was shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis has been identified by his family as 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti.He has been described as an avid outdoorsman who loved mountain biking and is understood to have joined protests after Renee Good, also 37, was shot dead by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in her car earlier this month.Conflicting accounts have emerged about the moments leading up to his death.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an agent fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they claim had a handgun, resisted attempts to disarm him. Some eyewitnesses and officials, as well as Pretti's family, have challenged that account.Videos show no evidence to support the claim he used any armed force to threaten agents.Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, his family said in a statement. They told the Associated Press news agency (AP) that he was upset by US President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration in the city. Pretti's mother also said her son cared immensely about the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations.\"He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,\" Susan Pretti told AP. She added: \"He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.\"Pretti had no interactions with law enforcement beyond traffic tickets, family sayPretti loved adventures with his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog Joule, who died around a year ago, AP reported. His family said he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to AP, court records show he had no criminal record.Pretti's parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful while protesting.\"We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,\" his father Michael Pretti told AP. \"And he said he knows that. He knew that.\"Pretti's family also explained he owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota - but they had never known him to carry it.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara also said police believed he was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, the BBC's US partner CBS reported. 'Please get the truth out about our son'After seeing videos suggesting their son was a \"domestic terrorist,\" Pretti's family issued a statement saying \"the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting\".They claimed videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. \"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,\" they urged in their statement.Pretti was a Democratic voter and had taken part in the wave of street protests after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, his ex-wife told AP.She said that he was someone who may shout at law enforcement officers at a protest but had never known him to be physically confrontational.ReutersA woman cries as people gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was shotA US citizen born in Illinois, Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir. He went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to his family.He worked as a research scientist before returning to education to qualify as a registered nurse.His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple of days before he was shot dead when they spoke about repairs he had done to the garage door at his home, AP reported. A Latino man had completed the work and Pretti's parents said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 (£74) tip.Doctor Dmitri Drekonja, who worked with Pretti, told ABC News the pair had bonded over their interest in mountain biking and would compare notes on which trails to ride.\"He was the type of person you enjoyed being around and the notion that this helpful, smiling joking guy was being labelled a terrorist? It's galling,\" he said.ReutersPeople gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was fatally shotNeighbours described Pretti as quiet and warmhearted.\"He's a wonderful person,\" Sue Gitar told AP, who lived downstairs from the nurse and said he moved into the building about three years ago. \"He has a great heart.\"Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbours said.\"I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,\" said Gitar.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlfred Lasteck,BBC AfricaandLucy FlemingAFP/Getty ImagesRigathi Gachagu is a wealthy businessman popular in his home region of Mount KenyaProminent Kenyan opposition figure Rigathi Gachagua has alleged there was an attempt on his life during a Sunday church service.Gachagua, who was sacked as deputy president in an impeachment trial in 2024, claimed a gang of rogue police officers had attacked the church in Othaya in the central county of Nyeri, using bullets and tear gas.Without providing evidence, he accused his former ally President William Ruto of ordering the attack. Ruto has not commented but Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen condemned the violence, calling it unacceptable.The police said an investigation had been launched, adding that no injuries had been reported.Reports to the police indicated that a tear-gas canister had been thrown inside St Peters Anglican Church at 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT) disrupting the service.Several vehicles were reportedly damaged within the church compound, the police added, appealing for witnesses.Gachagua, a wealthy businessman from the central Mount Kenya area and now a vocal critic of the president, said he was escorted to safety by his security team.He had posted photos of the incident on X and later held a news conference where he dismissed suggestions from pro-government bloggers that the attack had been stage-managed.\"Where can we get access to tear gas?... Where do we get access to AK-47 assault rifles?\" the Democracy for the Citizens Party leader asked.@rigathiRigathi Gachagua posted photos on X showing the chaos at the church compoundMurkomen said the police chief had promised him that the attackers would be brought to justice.\"Violence anywhere, and least of all in a place of worship, is unacceptable,\" the interior minister said in a post on X.\"The police must move without fear or favour and deal decisively with the sponsors and perpetrators of this act without regard to their status in society or political affiliation.\"According to Kenya's constitution, Gachagua's conviction by the senate means he cannot hold public office again. He had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of which he was found guilty of five, including inciting ethnic divisions and violating his oath of office.However the politician, popularly known as Riggy G, maintains he will be on the presidential ballot next year as he is appealing and the Supreme Court has not ruled on his impeachment.Ruto and Gachagua were elected on a joint ticket in 2022 - and the partnership helped Ruto win by marshalling support in Mount Kenya, the heartland of the Kikuyu people who are the largest voting bloc in Kenya.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal with China. \"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" Trump said on Truth Social. It is unclear what deal Trump is referring to in his social media post. Last week, Canada's Prime Minister Carney announced a \"strategic partnership\" with China, and agreed to reduce tariffs. At the time, Trump called the move \"a good thing\". But tensions between the US and Canada have grown in recent days, after Carney said in a speech in Davos that the US-led world order had been ruptured.Carney also urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", though he did not mention Trump by name.Trump responded to the remarks in his own speech the next day, saying: \"Canada lives because of the United States.\"The US president also withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his new Board of Peace.On Saturday, Trump said in his social media post that if Carney \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken\". The BBC has contacted the White House and Carney's office for comment.Canada's US trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement: \"There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China.\"\"What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues.\"LeBlanc said the government was focused on building a stronger Canadian economy and strengthening trade partnerships \"throughout the world\".Canada has been seeking to diversify trade away from the US, its largest trade partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs.Under the agreement reached between Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, China will lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will  tax Chinese EVs at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.The deal was seen as a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat tariffs, and could see more Chinese investments in Canada.Carney said the progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".",

    "body": "Australian Jay Vine won the Tour Down Under - despite being knocked off his bike in a crash caused by a kangaroo.Britain's Matthew Brennan took the fifth and final stage of the race in Australia, on a day dominated by drama in the peloton.The kangaroo ran across the road with under 100km of the race to go and launched itself into the peloton, knocking several riders to the ground before tumbling into more who were trying to avoid it.Vine, having been knocked down, used a team-mate's bike to claim the overall winner's ochre jersey by one minute three seconds for UAE Team Emirates-XRG.Visma-Lease A Bike rider Brennan beat New Zealand's Finn Fisher-Black of Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe to the line for the stage victory after a powerful acceleration on the uphill sprint finish.Brennan's team-mate Menno Huising of the Netherlands was one of the riders forced to abandon the race, having been injured in the kangaroo incident.Tobias Lund Andresen of Decathlon-CMA CGM took third on the 169.8km stage around the Stirling near Adelaide.Switzerland's Mauro Schmid of Jayco-AlUla was second overall and Australia's Harry Sweeney third for EF Education-EasyPost. Lund Andresen took the blue points jersey, with Norway's Martin Urianstad Bugge winning the mint-green king of the mountains jersey for Uno X Mobility.Brennan ranks highly among several young talented British riders competing on the UCI World Tour this year.He won 12 races in his debut elite-level season in 2025.The win caps a good week for British riders at the first World Tour race of the year following Ethan Vernon's sprint victory on Saturday's stage four for NSN - the new team co-owned by World Cup winner Andres Iniesta.That stage had been shortened to account for temperatures of up to 43C.UK road champion Sam Watson won the opening prologue of the race for Ineos Grenadiers.Many of the riders will now take on the one-day Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race in Melbourne, with Brennan a strong favourite for victory.Brennan is particularly powerful on rolling one-day courses, and is set to compete in several of the sport's biggest races this year, including the one-day Milan-San Remo in March, as well as the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix in April.

    "body": "13 hours agoAndrew WhiteheadGetty ImagesSir Mark spent much of his journalistic career covering IndiaThe broadcaster and journalist Sir Mark Tully - for many years known as the BBC's \"voice of India\" - has died at the age of 90.For decades, the rich, warm tones of Sir Mark were familiar to BBC audiences in Britain and around the world - a much-admired foreign correspondent and respected reporter and commentator on India. He covered war, famine, riots and assassinations, the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Indian army's storming of the Sikh Golden Temple.In the small north Indian city of Ayodhya in 1992, he faced a moment of real peril. He witnessed a huge crowd of Hindu hardliners tear down an ancient mosque. Some of the mob - suspicious of the BBC - threatened him, chanting \"Death to Mark Tully\". He was locked in a room for several hours before a local official and a Hindu priest came to his aid.How the Babri mosque destruction shaped IndiaWill English kill off India's languages?The demolition provoked the worst religious violence in India for many decades - it was, he said years later, the \"gravest setback\" to secularism since the country's independence from Britain in 1947.\"We are sad to hear the passing of Sir Mark Tully,\" Jonathan Munro, Interim CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said in a statement. \"As one of the pioneers of foreign correspondents, Sir Mark opened India to the world through his reporting, bringing the vibrancy and diversity of the country to audiences in the UK and around the world.\"His public service commitments and dedication to journalism saw him work as a bureau chief in Delhi, and report for outlets across the BBC. Widely respected in both India and the UK, he was a joy to speak with and will be greatly missed.\"India was where Sir Mark was born - in what was then Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1935. He was a child of the British Raj. His father was a businessman. His mother had been born in Bengal - her family had worked in India as traders and administrators for generations.He was brought up with an English nanny who once chided him for learning to count by copying the family's driver: \"that's the servants' language, not yours\", he was told. He eventually became fluent in Hindi, a rare achievement in Delhi's foreign press corps and one which endeared him to many Indians for whom he was always \"Tully sahib\". His good cheer and evident affection for India won him the friendship and trust of many of the top rank of the country's politicians, editors and social activists.Sir Mark, seen here with members of India's armed forces, arrived in India as an administrative assistant at the BBC in 1965Throughout his life, he performed a balancing act: English, without doubt; but not - he insisted - an expat who was passing through India. He had roots there; it was his home. It's where he lived for three-quarters of his life.Immediately after World War Two, at the age of nine, Sir Mark came to Britain for his education. He studied history and theology at Cambridge and then headed to theological college with the aim of being ordained as a clergyman before he - and the church - had second thoughts.He was sent to India for the BBC in 1965 - at first as an administrative assistant, but in time he began to take on a reporting role. His broadcasting style was idiosyncratic, but his strength of character and his insight into India shone through.Some critics said he was too indulgent of India's poverty and caste-based inequality; others admired his clearly expressed commitment to the religious tolerance upon which independent India was anchored. It's \"really important to treasure the secular culture of this country, allowing every religion to flourish,\" he told an Indian newspaper in 2016. \"... we must not endanger this by insisting on Hindu majoritarianism\".Getty ImagesSir Mark's was a familiar voice for BBC listeners in the UK and around the worldSir Mark was never an armchair correspondent. He travelled relentlessly across India and neighbouring countries, by train when he could. He gave voice to the hopes and fears, trials and tribulations, of ordinary Indians as well as the country's elite. He was as comfortable wearing an Indian kurta as in a shirt and tie.He was expelled from India at 24 hours' notice in 1975 after the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered a state of emergency. But he headed back 18 months later and had been based in Delhi ever since. He spent more than 20 years as the BBC's head of bureau in Delhi, leading the reporting not simply of India but of South Asia, including the birth of Bangladesh, periods of military rule in Pakistan, the Tamil Tigers' rebellion in Sri Lanka and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Over time, he became increasingly out of step with the BBC's corporate priorities, and in 1993 he made a much-publicised speech accusing the then director general, John Birt, of running the corporation by \"fear\". It marked a parting of the ways. Sir Mark resigned from the BBC the following year. But he continued to broadcast on BBC airwaves notably as presenter of Radio 4's Something Understood, turning back to issues of faith and spirituality which had engaged him as a student.Getty ImagesSir Mark stayed on in Delhi after he left the BBCUnusually for a foreign national, Sir Mark was accorded two of India's top civilian honours: the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan. Britain too gave him recognition. He was knighted for services to broadcasting and journalism in the 2002 New Year's honours list. He described the award as \"an honour to India\".He continued to write books about India - essays, analyses, short stories too, sometimes in collaboration with his partner, Gillian Wright. He lived un-ostentatiously in south Delhi.Sir Mark never gave up his British nationality but was proud also to become late in life an Overseas Citizen of India. That made him, he said, \"a citizen of the two countries I feel I belong to, India and Britain\".Read more on the story",

    "body": "Four attacks in 48 hours: How east Australia's beaches became a 'perfect storm' for sharks2 days agoGavin ButlerGetty ImagesThere are manifold reasons why recorded shark encounters are rising in Australia's oceans - but fatalities are relatively rareIt's \"extraordinary\", says shark researcher Chris Pepin-Neff: four shark bites within 48 hours, and three of them within a 15km (9-mile) stretch of Australia's east coast.On 18 January, a 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital with critical injuries and later died after being attacked while swimming in Sydney Harbour. The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition.Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board some 300km up the coast.\"This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research,\" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney.The succession of incidents caused alarm and dozens of beaches have been closed because of fears of more attacks. Calls for shark culls have gathered momentum.Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish.Many factors may have contributed to the recent series of incidents, they say – and the sharks are not the problem.Why suddenly so many shark attacks in Australia?Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127mm of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.That rainfall would have created \"perfect conditions\" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University.\"Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,\" she told the BBC. \"They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.\"Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.\"There's clearly an attractant in the water,\" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a \"perfect storm\" of low salinity freshwater could have created a \"biodiversity explosion\".\"The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.\"Are shark attacks increasing overall?Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".Getty ImagesDozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coastOlive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"Do shark culls work?In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.Experts reject the suggestion.\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"How can people avoid shark attacks?Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseCanada's Arctic is a massive, treacherous, and largely inhospitable place, stretched out over nearly 4 million square kilometres of territory - but with a small population roughly equal to Blackburn in England or Syracuse, New York.\"You can take a map of continental Europe, put it on the Canadian Arctic, and there's room to spare,\" Pierre Leblanc, the former commander of the Canadian Forces Northern Area told the BBC. \"And that environment is extremely dangerous.\"Standing at the defence of that massive landmass is an aging string of early warning radars, eight staffed military bases and about 100 full-time Coast Guard personnel covering 162,000km of coast, about 60% of Canada's total oceanfront.The Arctic region is the scene of intense geopolitical competition, bordered by Russia and the US on either side of the North Pole - and increasingly attractive to China, which has declared itself a \"near Arctic state\" and vastly expanded its fleet of naval vessels and icebreakers. Standing in the middle is Canada, whose population is a small fraction of the larger Arctic players. Nearly four years after Arctic security was thrust into the headlines following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the defence of Canada's far north has again been brought to the forefront of public consciousness by Donald Trump's designs on Greenland, a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark that the White House says is vital to safeguarding the US from would-be enemies abroad.Canada's Arctic has not gone unnoticed by the Trump administration, which has reportedly become increasingly concerned by perceived vulnerabilities to US adversaries, and in April signed an executive order underscoring American \"commitment to ensuring both freedom of navigation and American domination in the Arctic waterways.\"The Canadian government, for its part, has sought to reassure the US and Nato allies that it is doing its part to protect the region.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada is working to secure \"our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic\" through \"unprecedented\" investments in radar systems, submarines, aircraft and \"boots on the ground\" in the region.Col Leblanc, who spent a total of nine years in the Canadian Arctic, said those investments have marked a \"major shift\" in Arctic security, noting that increases in Canadian defence expenditure  - from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035 - have meant \"real action\" in terms of additional over-the-horizon radar and aircraft dedicated to the Arctic.Much of this focus, he added, has been prompted by the Trump administration's renewed focus on the Arctic and Greenland.\"[That] certainly helps the Canadian government move in the right direction,\" Leblanc added. Still, challenges persist, including limited port facilities and difficulties resupplying far-flung bases that are sometimes thousands of cold, empty miles apart.While Canada and other US Nato allies have opposed the Trump's administration bid to \"take over\" Greenland to protect the Arctic, several experts who spoke to the BBC agreed with the administration's broad assessment that additional defences in the region are urgently needed.Troy Bouffard, the director of the Fairbanks, Alaska-based Center for Arctic Security and Resilience, said that while on-the-ground cooperation between the US and Canada in the Arctic \"remains the envy of the world\", much of the existing defence infrastructure was designed to combat Cold War-era threats, rather than existing ones.In particular, he warned of the prospect of hypersonic missiles that travel at least five times the speed of sound, making them much harder to detect and intercept than traditional ballistic missiles, which would follow predictable arcs over the North Pole.Such a threat is no longer theoretical. Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat in Ukraine, including a January strike that saw the first operational use of the nuclear-capable \"Oreshnik\" missile that carries multiple warheads at approximately 10 times the speed of sound.\"That technology has changed everything for us. We have to relook at the entire North American defence system and re-do it,\" he said. \"What exists right now cannot defend against hypersonic cruise missiles, at all. Like 0%.\"Traditional ground-based radar systems, he added, \"are not going to work\" against these emerging technologies. Space-based satellites must also contend with coverage gaps in high latitudes, prompting a renewed focus and investments in over-the-horizon radar.Notably, over-the-horizon technology - along with space-based sensors - form a key part of the Trump administration's planned Golden Dome missile defence system for North America.For now, it is unclear what role Canada will play in the Golden Dome, a project Trump said at Davos Canada should \"be thankful for\".On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Canada was opposed to having the Golden Dome over Greenland \"even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada. Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will 'eat them up' within the first year!\". The BBC has contacted Carney's office for comment.Those negotiations have been strained by the often antagonistic relationship between the US and Canada, with Trump in May posting that Canada could pay $61bn to join the programme or become the 51st US state and join for free.Trump's remarks prompted Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, to compare it to a \"protection racket\". Despite tensions, Michael Byers, an expert in Arctic security at the University of British Columbia, said that American concerns over Arctic security, and their threats of tariffs, have helped prompt Canada's government to re-focus on the Arctic.\"Whether or not American concerns are justified, there is a feeling in Ottawa that we have to satisfy [them],\" he said. \"No one takes the 51st state issue seriously, but what we do take seriously are the economic pressures that the US is able to impose.\"\"The Canadian government is very aware of that possibility,\" he added.High level tensions between Ottawa and Washington, however, have yet to turn into tensions on-the-ground in the Arctic - with those there expressing confidence that the US and Canada are cooperating for the time being.\"That's the business of politicians,\" Bouffard said. \"It has complicated things, but the practitioners are still going to work together until they're not allowed to. Everyone's going to have to rise above the rhetoric.\"",

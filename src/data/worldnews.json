    "body": "Actor Kiefer Sutherland has been arrested after allegedly assaulting and threatening a ride-share driver in Hollywood, police have said. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Sutherland \"entered a ride-share vehicle, physically assaulted the driver (the victim), and made criminal threats\" in an incident at 00:15 PST (08:15 GMT) on Monday. The victim was not injured in the incident, the LAPD added.Sutherland, 59, was released after paying a bond of $50,000 (£37,000). He is due to appear in court on 2 February. The BBC has contacted his representatives for comment.The incident took place at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood and is under investigation by the LAPD's Hollywood Division.Sutherland, known for roles such as special agent Jack Bauer on Fox's 24, and as the US president in Designated Survivor, is the son of actor Donald Sutherland.The British-Canadian actor has been arrested several times in the past, and in 2007 he was sentenced to 48 days in jail for driving under the influence and violating probation.He was arrested for assault in 2009, although the charge was later dropped, and was most recently arrested after making an illegal U-turn in Hollywood in 2020.",

    "body": "You must have heard of Dubai chocolate: the sticky, indulgent confectionary filled with pistachio cream, tahini and shreds of knafeh pastry, which has become a global sensation.Now the decadent bar has inspired South Korea's latest dessert craze. The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. \"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. \"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily.

    "body": "Claudette Colvin, who helped end racial segregation in the US by refusing to give up her bus seat to a white person, has died. She was 86 years old. Colvin's protest, which led to her arrest, came in 1955 at the age of 15 while she was living in Montgomery, Alabama. It happened nine months before the arrest of Rosa Parks, who also famously refused to give her bus seat to a white person, in a move that led to widespread boycotting of public transportation in the city, and a Supreme Court decision that outlawed such racial discrimination. Colvin's arrest was largely unknown until 2009, when the first detailed book about her experience was published. \"She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history,\" said a statement from the Claudette Colvin Legacy Foundation, which announced her death.One year after her arrest, the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses must end. The legal case turned on the testimony of four plaintiffs, one of whom was Colvin.In an interview with the BBC in 2018, Ms Colvin recalled that she \"was not frightened, but disappointed and angry\" because she knew she \"was sitting in the right seat\".She was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies, but her story remained relatively unknown for decades. It was Rosa Parks who became one of the main figures of the civil rights movement after her very similar case led to the large-scale boycott of the bus system in the city. Colvin said she had been inspired by the great anti-slavery campaigners Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. \"Whenever people ask me: 'Why didn't you get up when the bus driver asked you?' I say it felt as though Harriet Tubman's hands were pushing me down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth's hands were pushing me down on the other shoulder,\" she told the BBC.Later in life, she became a nurse in New York. According to her organisation, she died in Texas.",

Without giving details, the committee said the chief physician and the head of the intensive care unit had been detained for the \"improper performance of their official and professional duties in organising and providing medical care\".It said the suspects were co-operating with the investigation and authorities were deciding on charges as well as pre-trial detention.The committee released a video showing one man being escorted away and a man signing some papers in the presence of a uniformed officer. Victims and witnesses had been questioned and materials seized as work continued to gather more evidence, it added.Nine post-mortem examinations were being carried out.The Interfax news agency said the Kemerovo Region Ministry of Health which was also investigating said the infants had had a severe intra-uterine infection. The hospital has announced that it is no longer accepting patients due to a higher-than-usual rate of respiratory infections.",

    "body": "China announced record export numbers for 2025, a year when US President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade policy caused turmoil in the global economy.Beijing on Wednesday reported the world's largest-ever trade surplus - the value of goods and services sold overseas compared to its imports - at $1.19tn (£890bn).It's the first time China's full-year trade surplus has passed $1tn, beating 2024's record figure of $993bn.China's monthly export surpluses passed $100bn seven times last year - a sign that Trump's tariff campaign have barely affected its overall trade with the rest of the world.Trade with the US did weaken, but this was made up for by a rise in Chinese exports elsewhere, especially to South East Asia, Africa and Latin America.Wang Jun, the deputy director of China's customs, said during a press conference on Wednesday that the figures are \"extraordinary and hard-won\" given the \"profound changes\" and challenges in global trade.He noted a rise in exports of green technology, artificial intelligence-related products and robotics.The huge surplus can be explained by strong overseas demand for Chinese goods as trade with global partners including South Asian countries and others in Africa and Europe grew, as well as a weak domestic market.China's economy has been weighed by a property crisis and rising debt, which has made businesses more hesitant to invest and consumers cautious about spending.As a result, there is less of a need to import goods, and imports rose by just 0.5%, according to the new figures.Meanwhile, a weaker yuan, a strong supply of goods and inflation in Western countries have also made Chinese exports more attractive.The results are a \"mixed blessing\" for Beijing, said trade policy analyst Deborah Elms from the Hinrich Foundation.China has benefited from sales and more jobs created from its business abroad, but its goods could face \"greater scrutiny\" from foreign markets that are under pressure to compete with its products, she said.China's success will likely continue in 2026 as Chinese goods and services become more deeply entrenched into global businesses, said Elms.These latest figures will be seen in Beijing as a sign that China has customers all around the world, besides the US, but Wang warned that China faces an uncertain external environment.Several countries have raised concerns that their markets are being flooded with low-priced Chinese products they cannot compete with.Businesses are also bracing for another year of turbulence and tariff tensions from the Trump administration.In April last year, Trump caused turmoil in the global economy by announcing sweeping tariffs on goods from more than 90 countries. Some of the most severe tariffs were reserved for China, which exports more to the US than any other country.An escalating war of words between the world's two largest economies saw threats of blanket triple-digit tariffs.At the time, trade experts saw this as a test of China's reliance on the US market, which Beijing insisted was just one of many places that Chinese businesses could sell to.Both sides managed to pause hostilities after a meeting between Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, avoiding a complete breakdown in trade relations.Other more moderate tariffs remain in place, which have severely dampened Chinese exports to the US.",

    "body": "8 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe US government has given chip giant Nvidia the green light to sell its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors in China, the Department of Commerce said on Tuesday.The H200, Nvidia's second-most-advanced semiconductor, had been restricted by Washington over concerns that it would give China's technology industry and military an edge over the US.The Commerce Department said the chips can be shipped to China granted that there is sufficient supply of the processors in the US.President Donald Trump said last month that he would allow the chip sales to \"approved customers\" in China and collect a 25% fee.Nvidia's spokesperson told the BBC that the company welcomed the move, saying it will benefit manufacturing and jobs in the US.The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said its revised export policy applies to Nvidia's H200 chips, as well as less advanced processors. Chinese customers must also show \"sufficient security procedures\" and cannot use the chips for military uses.The H200 chip is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell processor, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor and remains blocked from sale in China.Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told the BBC on Wednesday that Beijing has consistently opposed the \"politicisation and weaponisation of tech and trade issues\".\"We oppose blocking and restricting China, which disrupts the stability of industrial and supply chains,\" he said. \"This approach does not serve the common interests of both sides.\"Nvidia has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China - two sides of a global AI race.Trump reversed the chip-selling restriction last July, but demanded that Nvidia pay a cut of its earnings from China to the US government.Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to boycott Nvidia's China-bound chips and prioritise semiconductors made domestically. That move was designed to bolster China's tech industry, though experts have consistently said that the country's chips still lag behind the US.Throughout 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continually lobbied Washington to allow the sale of the firm's high-powered chips to China, arguing that global market excess is essential for America's competitiveness.Some officials in the US, however, have expressed concerns that the chips would benefit  Beijing's military and hurt America's progress in AI development.While Beijing is likely concerned about domestic firms becoming over-reliant on Nvidia, local firms will be eager to secure H200 chips - at least until homegrown alternatives get better, said semiconductor analyst Austin Lyons.Nvidia will also be happy to get any revenue from China, even if it comes at a lower margin due to the US government taking a cut of the sales, Lyons added.Trump's \"unique\" proposal to collect a cut of Nvidia's sales could also set a precedent for his negotiations in other trade tariffs, said Marc Einstein from Counterpoint Research.\"It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoKoh EweandJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentA surreal drum duet between two East Asian world leaders has set the internet abuzz - and put a spotlight on Japan and South Korea's diplomatic relationship.Decked out in matching blue jackets, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday played drums to the beats of K-pop hits - including Dynamite by BTS and Golden from hit film KPop Demon Hunters.The performance, a nod to Takaichi's past life as a drummer in a heavy metal band, wrapped up Lee's official visit to Japan this week.It's also part of Lee's diplomatic overtures to regional powers including Japan, with whom South Korea has a fraught history but shares a security alliance.The drumming session from Tuesday, which Lee described as \"a little clumsy\", has now spawned a viral video.During Lee's visit to Nara, Takaichi's hometown, he gifted the Japanese prime minister a drum set. The two leaders also exchanged signed drumsticks after their performance.\"When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise,\" Takaichi later wrote on X.Footage of the jam session has won praise on social media.\"Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could,\" one X user wrote in Korean. \"Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward.\"There have long been sore spots between the two neighbours, including historical grievances from Japan's colonial rule and territorial disputes.But both countries are allies of the US, and have worked together to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region.On Tuesday, Takaichi said in a statement that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the US has become increasingly important amid heightened tensions in the region's \"strategic environment\".Lee and Takaichi have also agreed to boost economic cooperation - a pledge that comes as China has been tightening its export of rare earths and dual-use goods to Japan.\"Just seeing them actually playing drums together - not just posing - looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most,\" an X user wrote in Japanese. \"Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction.\"Lee's smoothness as a diplomat has boosted his approval ratings back home.Days before his viral jam session with Takaichi, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, with whom he took selfies on a Chinese smartphone.Last October, he flattered US President Donald Trump with a large golden crown. The only leader he hasn't been able to charm is North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has rejected Lee's overtures for peace and shown little interest in reconciliation. This week, Pyongyang demanded an apology from Seoul after accusing it of flying surveillance drones in its territory.Lee's rise to become president of South Korea had previously sounded alarm bells in Tokyo and Washington. Relatively unknown outside his own country at the time, Lee had a reputation as a firebrand who was sympathetic to socialist economic causes. The US feared South Korea would tilt towards China, South Korea's largest trading partner.Japan, meanwhile, feared a repeat of a spat in 2019, when South Korea threatened to pull out of an intelligence-sharing agreement after Japan tightened its exports to the country.That fight broke out after a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate the survivors of Japan's wartime forced labour, an issue Japan now considers resolved.Since taking office, however, Lee has walked a diplomatic tightrope among the region's major powers, from the US to China and now Japan.Lee heaped praise on Takaichi's drumming skills in a post on X, and likened their diplomatic efforts to the musical duet.\"Even if our timing was slightly different, our intention to find the same rhythm was shared,\" he wrote. \"In that same spirit, we will continue to build a future-oriented Korea–Japan relationship together, with one heart.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoRegan Morris,Los Angeles, CaliforniaandChristal Hayes,Los Angeles, CaliforniaSport fans will be able to sign up from Wednesday for a chance to attend the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games - with tickets starting at $28 (£20.80).Registration opens at 07:00 local time (15:00 GMT) for fans to enter a random ticket draw covering all events that will take place at the Games. The window will remain open until mid-March. If chosen, fans will be notified via email and will be given a time slot to purchase tickets in April. One million of those tickets will sell for $28, and about one-third are set to cost less than $100 (£74.41).\"These Games belong to everyone,\" Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2028 said on Tuesday. \"These Games have to be affordable and inclusive.\"The announcement of affordable ticket prices come after the price of tickets for the 2026 men's football World Cup - which will also be hosted in the US, as well as Canada and Mexico - received some public criticism. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, LA officials said affordability and accessibility were central to their ticketing plan - and their hope that sport fans around the globe would be able to attend. Tickets for the 2024 Olympics in Paris started at $27.95 (£20).A special early purchase window will also be open for residents in the Los Angeles area and Oklahoma City, where some Olympic Games are also being held.2028 will be the first time the Olympics will be held in the US since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Los Angeles has twice hosted the Olympics - in 1932 and 1984 - and plans to use its already established infrastructure to host the Games. Event organisers, along with hundreds of Olympians and Paralympians, gathered at the LA Memorial Coliseum on Tuesday for a ceremonial lighting of the Olympic venue's cauldron ahead of the opening of ticket registration. The Coliseum hosted events on both the previous occasions that the Olympics were held in LA, and it is set to co-host the opening ceremony along with track and field events in 2028. Organisers at the event on Tuesday explained how the ticketing would work. Once registered - using their name, email and zip code - fans will be entered into the random draw for time slots to buy tickets in April. The earlier slot a fan is given, the better their chances at securing tickets - as being given a time slot does not guarantee that there will be tickets available once a time slot is open.The first set of tickets will be up for purchase from 9-19 April. Admission for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games will be among the tickets on offer.Most of the Games will be held across Los Angeles and southern California, but both canoeing and softball will be held in Oklahoma. LA28 chief Allison Katz-Mayfield called the random ticket-drawing process \"the fairest way to ensure that the broadest number of people can get access to tickets and that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged\". \"No matter when you go in, whether you're the first person in or the last person in, you have the same opportunity,\" she added.Registration for tickets will be open until 18 March, and there is no advantage to registering early.",

    "body": "1 hour agoHarry SekulichandJames FitzGeraldVenezuela has started releasing multiple Americans detained across the country, according to a US state department official. The official did not confirm the identities or number of prisoners released by Venezuela, but in a statement called the move \"an important step in the right direction by the interim authorities\". It is the first known release of American citizens since a US military operation seized President Nicolás Maduro and his wife during a raid in the capital Caracas on 3 January, to face drug trafficking charges in New York.The UN says Venezuela has so far only released about 50 people out of what campaigners say is a tally of more than 800 political prisoners in the country.The Venezuelan government, led by Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, announced last week it would start releasing \"a significant\" number of people considered political prisoners as a \"goodwill gesture\". Some domestic opposition figures and at least five Spanish citizens are among those confirmed to have been freed so far. But days later, human rights groups have criticised the slow pace of releases. Earlier this week, the son of a jailed opposition figure warned US President Donald Trump to \"not be fooled\" by Venezuela's promises.On Monday, the government said more than 100 such prisoners had already been released - a figure that exceeds the number confirmed by rights groups or the UN, but which still represents only a fraction of the total number believed to be held.The same day, the UN reiterated its longstanding concerns over the country's use of \"widespread and systematic use of arbitrary detention as a tool of repression\".Relatives of those still behind bars continue to express frustration and anxiety, and many of them have kept vigil outside the notorious El Helicoide prison in the capital Caracas.Tuesday's move to release detainees with foreign citizenship appears to signal an effort by Rodríguez to win the favour of the international community, and especially the US, despite the structures that existed during the rule of Maduro remaining in place after he was seized.The release of the US citizens comes ahead of a visit to the White House on Thursday by María Corina Machado, the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner who has made her own efforts to win over Trump.At least three Americans had been freed as of Tuesday night, a source told the New York Times. US Senator Rick Scott, a Republican who represents Florida, thanked Trump for pushing for the release of the prisoners, saying they had been \"held captive by Maduro's evil regime in Venezuela for too long\".Scott added in a social media post: \"Every single prisoner still held under Delcy Rodríguez should be released ASAP.\"Over the weekend, Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that the process of freeing detainees in Venezuela had begun \"in a BIG WAY\". Trump said he cancelled a second wave of airstrikes on Venezuela once he learned Caracas was cooperating with the release of prisoners.The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro. Human rights groups and political activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle its critics. Officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, where Maduro claimed victory despite opponents disputing the results.That vote lacked \"basic transparency and integrity\", according to the UN, and was denounced as rigged by the US which did not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader.Previous releases of Americans held in Venezuela have been negotiated through swap deals. Relatives of US citizens detained in the country have said that their loved ones have sometimes been detained while on personal travel. Americans are currently warned by their government against travelling to the South American country due to the risk of wrongful detention.Among those said to still be imprisoned in Venezuela is 28-year-old James Luckey-Lange, whose aunt recently told the Washington Post that he \"has no political ties to Venezuela at all\" and was \"just a kid that likes to travel\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentDonald Trump is the only world leader capable of stopping Vladimir Putin from threatening Europe, according to Poland's President Karol Nawrocki.In an interview with Radio 4's Today programme he said the Russian leader was not to be trusted, but that Europe needed to do everything it could to support President Trump in his efforts to end the war in Ukraine.President Nawrocki was already well-known as a firm supporter of Donald Trump even before he landed in Britain for meetings with PM Sir Keir Starmer and others. Now, he says that with Vladimir Putin's Russia threatening his country as well as central and eastern Europe, the US president was the only person who could, as he put it, \"solve this problem\" – as well as ending the war in Ukraine.Referring to last September's mass incursion by Russian drones, when more than 20 uncrewed aircraft crossed into Poland from Belarus and Ukraine, President Nawrocki called it \"an extraordinary situation\", adding that \"until that time, no Nato member state had experienced a drone attack on that scale\". Russia, he said, was testing Poland's defences and testing Nato's solidarity.The Polish president then thanked Britain for sending over RAF Typhoon jets to help defend his borders. He said Poland had been in a state of hybrid war with Russia since 2021, as it dealt with drones and disinformation. This Russian grey zone activity showed \"we are living in dangerous times\", he added.He was asked about his friendship with Donald Trump, particularly in the light of the US president's threats to take over \"by any means\" the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland, something which has rattled Europe and which threatens to rupture the 77-year old Nato alliance. The US, he insisted, despite recent statements by US officials to the contrary, was still the guarantor of security in Europe. What Donald Trump was doing on behalf of the Europeans, he said, \"deserved support and great respect\". President Nawrocki said he could see Europe \"detaching\" itself from the United States and said this was good neither for the economic security nor the military security of the European Union.That still left the awkward question of Greenland. This discussion, he said, should remain a matter between the Danish prime minister and President Trump. Karol Nawrocki was convinced that this question would be resolved through Nato and through dialogue between Denmark and the US.But President Nawrocki also used this interview to criticise European leaders for, as he put it, being \"involved in not so important things, in ideological issues such as green deal for instance, climate policy, migration issues\". Europe, he said, was not building its resilience and security over the years, whereas Poland was now allocating close to 5% of its GDP to defence.For Britain, though, he had some warm words. Relations between Poland and the UK were \"extremely important\" and today around one million Poles lived in the UK. \"I would like to express my very deep appreciation for the British soldiers who are stationed in Poland... taking responsibility for Nato's Eastern flank,\" he said. He expressed his hope that, with Poland's economy growing rapidly, Britain as host of next year's G20 summit would invite Poland to participate.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "25 minutes agoSammy AwamiBBC Africa, KampalaThe head of Uganda's electoral body says he has received threats warning him against declaring certain presidential candidates the winners of Thursday's election.Simon Byabakama said he would not be intimidated by such threats from senior state officials, whom he did not name.He was responding to a BBC question about a widely shared video which shows a presidential assistant saying the electoral commission would never declare opposition candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, as president, even if he were to win.\"Some people say if you don't declare so-and-so as president, you will see. I tell them that I am not in the business of donating votes,\" said Byabakama. President Yoweri Museveni, 81, who has ruled the country for nearly four decades, is seeking a seventh term in office.Bobi Wine, a 43-year-old pop star turned politician, is Museveni's main challenger, seeking to unseat him for the second time after finishing runner-up in 2021 polls.Six other candidates are also in the race, in which about 21.6 million voters are registered to vote.Campaigning has been marked by the disruption of opposition activities, including the detention of activists and the breaking-up of rallies by police.At the Electoral Commission headquarters in the capital, Kampala, Byabakama said he was not worried about threats from what he called \"idle people\".  \"You can see from my demeanour that fear is a word that does not exist in my vocabulary,\" said  the poll chief, adding that only the will of voters and the law would guide the process.In the video shared by the Daily Monitor newspaper on social media last week, Yiga Kisakyamukama, the special presidential assistant for service delivery and monitoring, was captured saying Museveni would never leave power through the ballot. \"Don't expect, don't even think, that Simon Byabakama would announce Bobi Wine. President Museveni, who is on the chair, will remain on the chair. Never think that Museveni would leave power through voting. No, no, no - don't waste our time,\" Kisakyamukama was heard saying. But Byabakama said Uganda's law, not individual opinions or threats, would determine the outcome of the presidential election.\"The law says that the candidate who receives more than 50% plus one of the total valid votes cast is the president of Uganda. It is the voters who determine how many votes a candidate gets. What the voters have said is what I will declare to the nation,\" he added. The poll chief said he would declare the results within 48 hours of the close of polling, in accordance with the country's laws. Responding to concerns about the heavy military presence in the streets, Byabakama said security forces were deployed to maintain peace and stability during the electoral process and should not intimidate voters. He also acknowledged opposition concerns about some polling stations being located within military premises, saying the commission was investigating the reports.\"If we find that it is true, we shall take the necessary measures to address it,\" he added.On Tuesday, the authorities cut internet access and limited mobile services across the country in order to curb \"misinformation, disinformation, electoral fraud and related risks\". The network outage has heightened concerns about repression in the run-up to the  vote. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoWedaeli ChibelushiAPP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAcross North Africa, the Amazigh people have been coming together to usher in the year 2976.They have, unfortunately, not cracked time travel. Rather, they are almost a thousand years ahead of much of the world because they follow a calendar that starts at 950 BC, when King Sheshonq ascended the throne of Egypt.The Amazigh new year, known as Yennayer, begins between 12 and 14 January - depending on the area in which they live in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya - so over the last few days families have been laying on huge feasts, lighting bonfires and playing traditional music. Calls of \"aseggas ameggaz\", or happy new year, have been ringing through villages and busy city streets, while vibrant, meticulously embroidered traditional clothing has been donned for the occasion.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAmazigh culture and language has gained greater recognition over the past decadeThe Amazigh (which means \"free people\" or \"noble people\") are a range of ethnic groups that are North Africa's original inhabitants, having occupied the region since the beginning of recorded history.The exact size of the population is not known because of a dearth of official statistics, but according to estimates there are tens of millions of Amazigh people living across North Africa. Algeria and Morocco have the biggest populations - the latter is thought to be 40% Amazigh.Yennayer centres on family gatherings, celebrating renewal and the deep connection the Amazigh people have traditionally had with nature.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThese days Yennayer is marked with parades, concerts and carnivalsBecause the Amazigh are a diverse group, traditional Yennayer food differs from country to country and area to area. In Morocco's High Atlas region, \"ourkemen\", a rich mixture of legumes, spices and whole grains, is a new year's favourite.Many families in Algeria enjoy \"trèze\", a combination of sweets, dried fruit and nuts, after the main meal. The snack mix is sometimes gently thrown over the youngest child in a symbol of prosperity.But Yennayer is not just a family thing. It can also be celebrated with the wider community - parades, concerts and carnivals take the new year's spirit out on to the streets.Such proud displays of Amazigh culture are particularly significant as the community has a long history of being marginalised.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesFood, including couscous, is an important aspect of the new year celebrationsIn the 7th Century, as Arab conquerors swept across North Africa, they brought with them their language and the Islamic religion.Both of these were adopted officially, at the expense of Amazigh languages and culture.For instance, during Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's rule of Libya, the Amazigh language Tamazight was banned in schools and parents were not even allowed to give their children Amazigh names.However, thanks to the dogged campaigning of Amazigh activists, their culture and language has seen greater recognition over the past decade.In 2011, Morocco recognised Tamazight as an official language. Both Algeria and Morocco also declared Yennayer a public holiday, in 2017 and 2023 respectively.So Yennayer marks not just a victory for the Amazigh people, but also a reminder of centuries-long fight that has got the community to where it is now - in 2976.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesYennayer is now a public holiday in Algeria and MoroccoGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

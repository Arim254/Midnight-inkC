    "body": "Australian girls are being hunted by online crime networks and coerced into acts of violence - against themselves, their siblings or pets - in a \"twisted type of gamification\", police have warned.A new Australian taskforce has been set up to help the globe tackle this \"new and disturbing front in traditional gender-based violence\", Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Krissy Barrett said in a speech on Wednesday.Three people have already been arrested in Australia, and another nine people around the world.The nature of the acts being committed by targets were not detailed, but Ms Barrett says the alleged perpetrators hold violent extremist views and want to hurt people \"for fun\".Aged in their late teens or early 20s and largely from Western backgrounds, they recruit pre-teen or teenage girls through gaming platforms such as Roblox or messaging apps such as Discord and Telegram.The boys and men, whom Ms Barrett calls \"crimefluencers\", subscribe to a variety of ideologies - including nihilism, sadism, Nazism and satanism - and they target girls with low self-esteem and mental health disorders.\"These groups have a similar culture to multiplayer, online gaming culture, and hunt, stalk and draw in victims from a range of online platforms,\" she said, adding that they may not fully understand the consequences of their behaviour.\"The motivation of individuals within these networks is not financial nor is it for sexual gratification – this is purely for their amusement, for fun, or to be popular online.\"Almost 60 alleged offenders had been identified in Australia alone, Ms Barrett said, and the AFP was working with other Five Eyes nations - the US, UK, New Zealand and Canada - to target the groups.Tech companies are also helping police develop an AI tool which will help detect emojis and slang used as code when discussing sadistic online exploitation in encrypted communications.Ms Barrett's speech comes as Australia prepares to introduce a world first social media ban for kids under the age of 16, aimed at minimising online harm. However gaming and messaging platforms are exempt from the new laws, which come into effect in December.",

    "body": "An 80-year-old Australian woman has been found dead on a Great Barrier Reef island after being left behind by the cruise ship she was travelling on.The woman had been hiking on Lizard Island, 250km (155 miles) north of Cairns, with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer cruise ship on Saturday but is believed to have broken off from the group to have a rest.The ship left the island around sunset but returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing. A major search operation found her body on Sunday morning. No details have been released.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said it was investigating and would meet the ship's crew later this week.It is understood the woman, who has not been named, was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, with tickets costing in the tens of thousands of dollars for the journey.She had joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, before she decided she needed to rest, according to the Courier Mail newspaper.But she did not make it back to the ship, which then departed without her.Traci Ayris was sailing near the island last weekend and told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that she saw a helicopter using a spotlight to search a walking trail on the island at around midnight on Saturday. She said about seven people with torches went to the island to search but it was called off at around 03:00 on Sunday (18:00 GMT Saturday) with a helicopter returning on Sunday morning when the body was apparently found.\"We knew she was dead because they called everyone back from the search immediately,\" she told ABC.\"And no-one went to the spot that the chopper was hovering over until later that day when the police arrived.\"A spokesperson for Amsa said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 on Saturday by the ship's captain.The authority said it would work with other relevant agencies to investigate the case and that it takes the safety of passengers and crew onboard commercial vessels seriously.Ms Ayris also said the incident was clearly distressing for crew and passengers.\"It was very sad in this paradise to have this tragedy occur. It should have been a happy time for that lovely lady.\"A report into the \"sudden and non-suspicious death\" of the woman will be prepared for the coroner, Queensland police said.Coral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield said staff had contacted the woman's family and were offering support over the \"tragic death\".\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,\" Mr Fifield said.\"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is under way,\" he added.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.The vessel has continued its voyage to Darwin.",

    "body": "Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has said the US revoked his visa and banned him from the country. The 91-year-old author, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, said the US consulate asked him to bring in his passport so his visa could be cancelled in person as new unspecified information had come to light.Soyinka called the invitation a \"rather curious love letter from an embassy\" in a news conference held on Tuesday and told organisations hoping to invite him to the US \"not to waste their time\".The US embassy in Nigeria has said it cannot comment on individual cases.The Nobel laureate has previously held permanent residency in the US but renounced it in 2016, tearing up his green card in protest of President Donald Trump's election.The green card is a permanent residence permit for the US - prized by many African immigrants to the US.Soyinka affirmed on Tuesday that he no longer had his green card – and jokingly added that it had \"fallen between the fingers of a pair of scissors and it got cut into a couple of pieces\". The famed author has had regular teaching engagements at US universities for the past 30 years.\"I have no visa. I am banned,\" he said on Tuesday.Soyinka has long been critical of the Trump administration's radical stance on immigration and linked the visa revocation to his outspoken criticism.He said his recent comparison of Trump to Uganda's dictator - \"Idi Amin in white face\" - may have contributed to the current situation.\"When I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment,\" Soyinka said, \"he's been behaving like a dictator.\" Idi Amin was a Ugandan military officer and dictator who ruled the country from 1971 to 1979, infamous for his brutal regime and widespread human rights abuses.When asked if he would consider going back to the US, Soyinka said: \"How old am I?\"In July, the US State Department announced sweeping changes to its non-immigrant visa policy for citizens of Nigeria and several other African countries.According to the policy, nearly all non-immigrant and non-diplomatic visas issued to Nigerians and nationals of Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ghana would now be single-entry and valid for only three months, rolling back the up to five-year, multiple-entry visas they had enjoyed previously.",

At least four protesters have been killed during clashes between security forces and opposition supporters since Cameroon's election on 12 October, with 92-year-old President Paul Biya winning an eighth consecutive term.Tchiroma Bakary insists he won the election, a claim dismissed by Biya's ruling party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM).Violent crackdowns by police and security officers on protesters have alarmed the international community, with the UN, African Union and EU calling for restraint.The 92-year-old president who never losesOn Tuesday, Nji accused Tchiroma Bakary of organising what he said were \"illegal\" protests leading to the loss of lives, and also criticised him for declaring victory in the election.He added that Tchiroma Bakary's \"accomplices responsible for an insurrectionary plan\" will also face legal action.Paul Biya, who came to power in 1982 and is now the world's oldest head of state, won the 12 October election with 53.7% of the vote, compared to 35.2% for Tchiroma Bakary, according to Cameroon's Constitutional Council.Tchiroma Bakary is yet to respond to the government's decision to try him, but he had previously told the BBC that he would not accept a stolen vote - and that he was not afraid of being arrested.On election result day, he said armed men opened fire on protesters assembled near his residence in Garoua, fatally wounding at least two civilians.On Tuesday, the interior minister revealed that an investigation would be launched into violent incidents before and after the announcement of the election results.\"During these attacks, some of the criminals lost their lives,\" he said, without providing a specific number of protesters who have been killed in the clashes.Nji added that several members of the security forces had also sustained serious injuries.Although Nji insisted the situation nationwide was now under control, protesters remain active in some parts of the country, especially in Douala and Garoua, where demonstrators mounted roadblocks on Tuesday, and burnt tyres on the streets.Analysts warn the post-electoral violence could plunge the country into a political crisis.Additional reporting by Natasha Booty and Michel Mvondo",

    "body": "48 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe co-founder of ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's says that its parent company Unilever blocked it from launching an ice cream flavour that expressed \"solidarity with Palestine\".Ben Cohen announced that he will independently create the new flavour as part of a personal series highlighting causes the company has been barred from addressing publicly.Ben & Jerry's is known for its activism on social issues and has consistently spoken out on political, environmental and humanitarian matters - including the Israel-Gaza conflict.A spokesperson for the Magnum Ice Cream Company, Unilever's ice cream arm, said it had determined that \"now is not the right time to invest in developing this product\". Mr Cohen's statement deepens the long-drawn dispute between the world-famous ice cream maker and Unilever, the British packaged goods giant which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000.The co-founders said Unilever and Magnum, which is in the process of being spun off from its parent company, had unlawfully blocked their company from \"honouring its social mission\".\"The independent members of Ben & Jerry's Board are not, and have never been, responsible for the Ben & Jerry's commercial strategy and execution,\" said Magnum. It said the company would continue to focus on \"ongoing, impactful campaigns close to its communities\", including campaigning for improved conditions in refugee accommodation in the UK, and freedom of speech rights in the United States.  Mr Cohen said in an Instagram video on Tuesday that he is creating a new watermelon-flavoured sorbet, calling for ideas for the product's name and what ingredients should be added.The watermelon has become a symbol for solidarity with Palestinians due to its colours, which are similar to those of the Palestinian flag – red, green, black and white. The American entrepreneur said Ben & Jerry's were prevented by Unilever from creating the dessert.\"I'm doing what they couldn't,\" Mr Cohen says from his set in a kitchen. \"I'm making a watermelon-flavoured ice cream that calls for permanent peace in Palestine and calls for repairing the damage that was done there.\"In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel. Its Israeli operation was sold by Unilever to a local licensee, allowing its ice cream to continue being sold in the occupied West Bank.The dessert series will be developed under Ben's Best, Mr Cohen's activist ice cream brand, he said in a statement to the press. The flavour is being produced independently of Ben & Jerry's, the statement said.Ben's Best was first setup in 2016 to support former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with the flavour \"Bernie's Back\". Mr Cohen said he will develop other ice cream flavours that speak to the issues Ben & Jerry's was silenced from addressing publicly by Unilever.In September, co-founder Jerry Greenfield stepped down from Ben & Jerry's after decades at the company, citing concerns that its independence had been compromised following Unilever's decision to curb its social activism.At the time, Ben Cohen said that \"Jerry has a really big heart and this conflict with Unilever was breaking it.\"\"My heart leads me to continue to work inside the company to advocate for its independence so that it can actualise the social mission, the values that it was founded on and has maintained for over 40 years,\" he told the BBC's PM programme.",

    "body": "Romania's defence ministry has said the US intends to reduce some of its troops stationed on Nato's eastern flank.Between 900 and 1,000 American troops will remain in Romania, Bucharest said - down from 1,700. The ministry said the decision was expected and that the \"resizing\" of US forces was a result of the new priorities of the Trump presidential administration.Defence Minister Ionut Mosteanu stated that his US counterpart Pete Hegseth had recently conveyed to the Europeans that they needed to pay more attention to their own defence and that the US was shifting its attention towards the Indo-Pacific region.One US brigade at the Mihai Kogalniceanu airbase - set to be Nato's largest in Europe - would be rotated out and not replaced, Mosteanu said.The brigade has \"elements\" in Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, Mosteanu said, although it was unclear whether US troops were going to be pulled out of these countries too.Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Wednesday that Warsaw had \"no information\" about a possible reduction of US troops on its territory. The BBC has approached the Pentagon for comment.The presence of US troops at Romania's Deveselu and Campia Turzii bases would remain unchanged, Ionut Mosteanu added.Since taking office in January US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his wish to shift the focus of US military commitment from Europe to the Indo-Pacific region, and has repeatedly urged European Nato members to take more responsibility for the continent's defence.But the announcement of the US troop withdrawal from Romania will be concerning for Eastern European countries, many of which feel they have reason to fear a Russian attack in the future.Shortly after the announcement from Bucharest, a Nato official stressed that Washington's commitment to the Nato alliance remained \"clear\" and adjustments were \"not unusual\".\"Even with this adjustment, the US force posture in Europe remains larger than it has been for many years, with many more US forces on the continent than before 2022,\" the official said in a statement.The US has more than 100,000 military personnel deployed in Europe, according to figures from late last year.Last month Nato announced the creation of a mission dubbed Eastern Sentry, which it said would enhance the alliance's vigilance along the entire eastern flank. The decision came after a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace, in the most serious incident of its kind since the war began in February 2022. Days later,  Romania reported that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, and Estonia said Russian warplanes had violated its airspace too.",

The Red Command (Comando Vermelho) responded with gunfire, burning barricades and dropping bombs from drones, officials said. The UN Human Rights Office said it was \"horrified\" by the police operation, urging \"prompt and effective investigations\".The area of favelas near Rio's airport is considered to be the headquarters of one of Brazil's most powerful organised crime groups.State officials said at least 50 of those killed were \"indicated by police as suspected of being criminals\".Dozens of people were injured, including civilians caught in the crossfire.Locals have likened the hillside area - home to about 300,000 people - to a \"war zone\" since the operation began.Roads remain closed throughout the region.The Red Command group have been expanding their territory across the Rio state, increasing drug trafficking routes and control of the hillside favelas.Rio's police said more than 200kg (441lb) of drugs were seized in the raid, along with dozens of firearms.The joint operation by civil and military police comes after a year-long investigation.Dozens of the suspects are thought to be members of a faction from the Pará state who are currently hiding in Rio de Janeiro.Large-scale police operations are not uncommon in Brazil ahead of major international events in the South American nation. The UN climate summit COP30 is taking place in the northern city of Belem in November.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesGeert Wilders is facing a strong challenge from left-leader Frans Timmermans and liberal Rob JettenGeert Wilders' anti-Islam Freedom party is facing a tight race in Wednesday's Dutch election, and even if he wins the vote his hopes of forming a new government appear minimal.Wilders was the clear winner last time Dutch voters went to the polls in November 2023, but final opinion polls ahead of voting suggest a fall in his support.Dutch voters are grappling with a series of crises, from a chronic housing shortage to overcrowded asylum centres. The cost of living is rising with sky-high rents and healthcare costs.Unlike last time, Wilders' rivals are refusing to work with him after he brought down his own coalition government last June.Voting at most of the country's more than 10,000 polling stations continues until 21:00 (20:00 GMT) on Wednesday.Commentators believe it is more important who comes second in the vote than first, as it could decide who will form the next government.Even if Wilders' party comes top, the next Dutch government is more likely to come from the centre left or centre right.The race is wide open, and more than a third of Dutch voters were seen as undecided on the eve of the election.\"It's one of the most important elections, because people need to have their faith restored,\" says Sarah de Lange, professor of Dutch politics at Leiden University.As many as 15 parties are set to win a share of parliament's 150 seats, but opinion polls suggest four will stand out. Apart from Wilders' PVV, there is GreenLeft-Labour under ex-EU top official Frans Timmermans, Rob Jetten's liberal D66 and the centre-right Christian Democrats of Henri Bontenbal.For almost half of Dutch voters, the housing crisis is top priority, with a shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Housing has taken stage in the election, and although Wilders has blamed the crisis on migration, others point to a rise in single-person households and planning gridlock.Most of the parties have vowed to tackle the issue head-on. Frans Timmermans promises at least 100,000 new homes per year if his party takes office, while Rob Jetten of the liberals says the solution lies on building on 1% of agricultural land.Unemployment hit 4% last month, which is low in European terms but the highest rate for four years in the Netherlands. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose 8.8% over the past year, signalling growing anxiety among workers about job security.EPA/ShuttlestockLiberal-conservative leader Dilan Yesilgöz labels Wilders' party \"one man with a Twitter account\"Considered for so long the outsider of Dutch politics, Geert Wilders played a key role in the last government, both in setting it up and in bringing it down after only 11 months, in a row over immigration. His coalition partners refused to let him become prime minister, but having former spy chief Dick Schoof lead a technocrat cabinet was a workaround that ultimately failed.Former coalition partner Dilan Yesilgöz, the leader of the conservative-liberal VVD, told Wilders his \"party exists as one man with a Twitter account and nothing more\".Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesWilders' lead in the polls narrowed in the weeks leading up to the electionYesilgöz's jibe was not completely out of place as Wilders does not allow his PVV to have members. Yesilgöz's own VVD party is polling down in fifth place.Wilders was on the backfoot ahead of the vote, having to apologise to Frans Timmermans after two Freedom party MPs posted AI-generated images of the left-wing leader being led away in handcuffs.When Wilders won two years ago, Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam says he was able to harness the votes of more radical voters on the right who were worried about Islam and Eurosceptic along with less radical voters.\"People called him Milders, a milder version of himself,\" says Prof Rooduijn, who points out that Wilders then put on ice many of his anti-Islam policies to appear more palatable.Although Wilders no longer talks of banning mosques and the Koran, he sees Islam as \"the greatest existential threat to our freedom\", a view Prof Rooduijn describes as \"really a key element of his nativism - an exclusionary form of nationalism\".In one TV debate, Wilders said \"take a walk [in central Rotterdam] on shopping night on Saturday evening and it's like you're in Marrakesh; it's not the Netherlands any more\".Left-wing leader Timmermans has accused him of scapegoating an entire section of society: \"You're blaming Islam.\"But the risk Wilders faces now is of losing both the more radical voters, if they fail to turn out, and the less radical voters who could drift to other parties, including the anti-immigration Ja21.\"Right now I don't think it's very likely Wilders will be part of a government coalition,\" Prof Rooduijn believes.It can take weeks - if not months - for parties to form a coalition, but if the centre right takes power, Christian Democrat Henri Bontenbal could be in the frame to lead it.His CDA party has staged a remarkable comeback in that only two years ago they won just five seats.Bontenbal believes Dutch voters are looking now at a return to \"what I'll call 'boring politics'. The Netherlands is done with populism\".He has not had a great campaign, though. Days after he defended the right of religious schools to teach that homosexual relationships were wrong, he went back on himself and admitted he had made a mistake.",

    "body": "A statue of a Confederate general that was torn down and set on fire in 2020 during social justice protests in Washington has been reinstalled under orders from President Donald Trump. General Albert Pike's statue has long been a source of controversy, as have many Confederate monuments across the US which were erected decades after the Civil War.The National Park Service announced in August its plan to return the refurbished statue, after Trump signed an executive order called \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\".Democratic Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia, called the restoration  “offensive to members of the military who serve honorably”.On Monday afternoon,  videos showed the area surrounding Pike's statue in Washington with a sign that read  \"Area close. Historic preservation work in progress\". \"The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic-preservation law and recent executive orders to beautify the nation’s capital and restore pre-existing statues,\"  the National Park Service in a statement.These confederate statues caused US protests. Knocked down, they're the centre of a new art showThe statue, which was built in 1901, has been a source of controversy for many years. Members of local government have been calling for its removal for decades. Holmes Norton, a long-time critic, has introduced legislation to remove the Pike statue permanently multiple times. \"Pike himself served dishonourably,\" she said in a statement after the statue was restored. \"He took up arms against the United States, misappropriated funds, and was ultimately captured and imprisoned by his own troops.\"\"Confederate statues should be placed in museums as historical artifacts, not remain in parks or other locations that imply honor,\" Holmes Norton added. Pike's statue was the only monument to a Confederate general in the nation's capital before it was pulled down in 2020.Pike was a longtime leader of the Freemasons, a centuries-old secretive society, who paid for the statue. His body is interred at the Washington headquarters of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which also contains a small museum in his honour.Pike's critics have accused him of being instrumental in the formation of the Ku Klux Klan. Masons insist that evidence doesn't support the allegations.The plaque that previously labelled the statue read \"author, poet, scholar, soldier, jurist, orator, philanthropist and philosopher\". Anti-racism protesters used ropes and chains to pull down the Pike statue following the murder of  George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of a police officer in 2020.Then-President Trump, in his first term, condemned the toppling on Twitter, writing: \"The DC police are not doing their job as they watched a statue be ripped down and burn. These people should be immediately arrested. A disgrace to our country.\"Floyd's death ignited a nationwide reckoning with systemic racism, prompting widespread calls to remove Confederate monuments. Ultimately, more than 300 such memorials were taken down across the country.Since returning to the White House, Trump has ordered statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled. ",

    "body": "1 day agoCherylann Mollan, BBC News and Vishnukant Tiwari, BBC HindiBhopal, Madhya PradeshBBCAarish says he's worried about missing work after losing vision in his left eyeAarish, 15, sits on a hospital bed in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. A pair of dark glasses hides a painful injury in his left eye.His cornea was damaged a week ago when an improvised firecracker device that he bought to celebrate the Diwali festival exploded near his face, causing him to lose vision in one eye. He has undergone emergency surgery and his doctor says only time will tell how much sight he can regain.The teenager, who doesn't go to school, says he's most worried about missing work - his father works as a gardener and Aarish repairs televisions to supplement the family income. Child labour is illegal in India, but millions of children work. Indian law allows children above 14 years to work in some industries which are seen as non-hazardous.Aarish is among hundreds of children and young adults from at least five states across northern India who have suffered serious eye injuries from using the same kind of device - called \"carbide guns\" - during Diwali.The \"carbide gun\", a rudimentary device, using calcium carbide in a plastic pipe, gives dramatic results  - a loud blast that sounds like a gunshot, accompanied by fiery sparks. But the explosion is unpredictable and often delayed - officials told the BBC that many of the injuries occurred when children peeped inside the pipe to check just as the blast happened.The sale and purchase of calcium carbide is regulated in India, but farmers and shopkeepers often use it to artificially ripen fruit. Police officials also say the crude guns are sometimes used to scare away animals from fields.But many in India had not heard of these guns until last week, when a spate of injuries was reported after Diwali. Officials said these devices began flooding local markets in northern India after viral social media videos showed them being used as firecrackers.Karan, 14, went through surgery at Hamidia Hospital in BhopalMore than 100 cases of carbide gun-related eye injuries have been reported in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal district alone, with at least 15 requiring surgery. Another 100 cases have been reported from three other districts. In Bihar state, 170 cases have been reported, with 40 requiring surgery, says Dr Bibhuti Prassan Sinha, who heads the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology in Patna city. The actual numbers are likely to be higher, he added.Cases have also been reported from the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, as well as capital Delhi. Some states, including Madhya Pradesh, have now banned the use of carbide guns as firecrackers and several sellers have been arrested.Kavitha Kumar, head of ophthalmology at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, says that patients have been coming in with mild, moderate and severe eye injuries.\"In milder cases, skin on the eye and around it has sustained chemical injuries and thermal burns. In moderate cases, chemical particulate matter has caused mild damage to the cornea and in severe cases, there's extensive damage to the cornea, causing temporary vision loss. With surgery, the patient may be able to regain their sight over time,\" she says. Some doctors told the BBC that they were shocked by the severity of the injuries. Dr Aditi Dubey from Hamidia Hospital said that she had never seen chemical injuries caused by Diwali firecrackers and had to research what \"carbide guns\" were.Many patients said that they bought the gun after seeing it on Instagram Reels and YouTube videos. An attractive aspect was the price - at 150-200 rupees ($1.70-$2; £1.28-£1.70) a piece, it was a relatively cheap firecracker that promised to make a big impact.A search for the term \"carbide gun\" on Instagram and YouTube throws up dozens of videos of young people making and using these devices, often accompanied by rap music. Carbide guns began popping up in local markets in the weeks before DiwaliSome accounts have also termed these videos \"science experiments\" with hashtags like \"useful project\" and \"experiment video\".Dr Sinha told the BBC that one of his patients was an engineering student who made the gun at home after watching such videos. He's currently being treated after losing vision in one of his eyes.Calcium carbide is a regulated substance in India - its possession, use and manufacturing are controlled by law because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse.When it comes in contact with water, it produces acetylene gas, which is highly flammable and has damaging properties on health.Under the Calcium Carbide Rules, 1987, a licence is needed for its sale, purchase and storage - but only for quantities above 200kg.A government official in Bhopal who didn't want to be named told the BBC that calcium carbide is still widely used to artificially ripen fruit despite a federal ban as it contains traces of poisonous substances.Alzain and his mother, Afreen, at Hamidia HospitalHarinarayanachari Mishra, Police Commissioner of Bhopal, told the BBC that carbide guns are also used in northern India during wedding festivities and by farmers to drive away monkeys.Dr Partha Biswas, president of the All India Ophthalmological Society, says carbide guns should be banned urgently.\"It's a national problem. And the seriousness of these incidents shouldn't be minimised as mere \"accidents\" that took place during the Diwali festival,\" he says.He adds that there's potential for these guns to be used as firecrackers during other festivals and events, like when India wins a cricket match or during New Year.\"These crude 'carbide bombs' or 'carbide guns' can cause permanent blindness, disfigurement and disability,\" he says, demanding a nationwide crackdown on manufacturers and sellers of the guns as well as more control over the supply chain of calcium carbide.Back at Hamidia Hospital, Alzain, whose left eye was operated on after he lost his vision, sits inside the tight embrace of his mother. The seven-year-old had pestered his uncle to buy the gun after watching videos on YouTube. Alzain's worried mother, Afreen, hasn't left his bedside since he was admitted a week ago.\"I'm scared for his future,\" she says. \"I hope he's able to see again.\"",

    "body": "49 minutes agoKoh Ewe,Singapore and Kathryn Armstrong,LondonGetty ImagesThe meeting comes as both countries are still trying to reach a trade dealThe US and South Korea have reached a broad trade deal, both countries have said following talks between their leaders. South Korea's presidential aide, Kim Yong-beom, said the two sides will keep reciprocal tariffs at 15%, as was agreed earlier this year, but that the taxes on car and car parts would be lowered. South Korea will also invest $350bn in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding, Kim said. US President Donald Trump, who is currently on a week-long trip in Asia, said the deal was \"pretty much finalised\" at a dinner following the discussions, which lasted almost two hours. He did not give further details. \"We had a tremendous meeting today with South Korea\", Trump said, adding that \"a lot was determined\".\"We discussed some other things to do with national security et cetera. And I think we came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"Both sides had played down the prospect of a breakthrough ahead of Wednesday's talks - disappointing many in South Korea's electronics, chip and auto industries, which had been hoping for some clarity amidst the tariff chaos. Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which South Korean President Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn in the US and buy $100bn worth of liquified natural gas.But the White House later increase its demands as part of the trade talks, with Trump pushing for cash investments in the US.Both countries have historically been key allies - but tensions spiked after hundreds of South Koreans were detained in an immigration raid in the US last month.Caught in the middle, South Korea hosts rival superpowersTrump will next meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in on Thursday on the sidelines of a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) which is taking place in Gyeongju.China's foreign ministry has confirmed the meeting, which will take place in the city of Busan on Thursday, a short flight away from Gyeongju. The US president said on Wednesday that he was \"looking forward\" to the meeting.\"We've been talking a lot over the last month and I think we're going to have something that's gonna be very, very satisfactory to China and to us.\"This will be the two leaders' first face to face meeting since Trump assumed office in 2025 and imposed tariffs on every country in the world.Addressing a group of CEOs in Gyeongju on Wednesday, Trump said that he believes the US is \"going to have a deal\" with China and it will be \"a good deal for both\".He also praised the Apec countries for making the global trading system, which he said had been \"broken\" and \"in urgent need of reform\", fairer.\"Economic security is national security,\" Trump says. \"That's for South Korea, that's for any country.\"Golden crowns and grand ordersAhead of Wednesday's talks with President Lee, Trump had been greeted by an honour guard and gifts that included a golden crown. \"I'd like to wear it right now,\" Trump had said of the crown. He also received the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decoration.He's the first US president to receive the award, which was given \"in recognition of his contribution to peace on the Korean Peninsula\", the South Korean presidential office said.Both leaders took part in a working lunch - which was followed by a private meeting in the afternoon. ReutersThe US president was gifted a golden crown and the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decorationTrump's arrival in South Korea had been preceded by North Korea test-firing surface-to-air cruise missiles.The US president had expressed interest in meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but noted on Wednesday that his team had been unable to arrange this during his trip.Noting the long-standing tensions between North and South Korea, Trump said \"we will see what we can do to get that all straightened out\".And outside the summit venue where both leaders were meeting, a small anti-Trump group of protesters gathered on Wednesday afternoon, with some shouting anti-Trump slogans. Police could be seen forcibly dispersing the crowd and arresting some people.However, hundreds more attended a pro-Trump rally - including those who shouted anti-Chinese rhetoric  - also took places close to the summit venue. Anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea has also grown steadily in recent years. Chinese interference became a common trope in conspiracy theories about former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol.BBC/Leehyun ChoiDozens of people attended a protest outside the Gyeongju National Museum on WednesdayDuring his trip to Japan on Tuesday, the US president signed an agreement on rare earth minerals with Tokyo, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations. This reiterated the commitment of the two countries to implement deals struck earlier, including the 15% tariff deal negotiated earlier this year.Prior to that, he attended a gathering of South East Asian leaders, known as Asean, in Malaysia. There he presided over a \"peace deal\" between Thailand and Cambodia, whose longstanding border dispute erupted into open conflict in July.With additional reporting by Laura Bicker, China Correspondent and Suranjana Tewari, Asia Business Correspondent",

    "body": "Rare earths, Nobel nomination and cheers: Trump ends Japan leg of Asia tour1 day agoAnthony Zurcher,North America correspondent and Shaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentWatch: Trump addresses cheering troops on US carrier in JapanPraise, Nobel nominations and promises of foreign investment in the US - Japan's newly-elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi rolled out the red carpet for Donald Trump on Tuesday.Trump in turn had warm praise for Takaichi, telling her that the US would be there for \"anything you want, any favours you need, anything… to help Japan\".The two leaders signed a deal on rare earth minerals, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations which reiterated the commitment of the two countries to implement deals struck earlier, including the 15% tariff deal negotiated earlier this year.The pageantry and the venue also seemed tailor-made for the US president.A full military guard of honour and band welcomed Trump to the ornate Akasaka Palace, with its vaulted ceilings and gold-encrusted walls not unlike what the president wants in his planned White House ballroom.Over lunch, Trump congratulated Takaichi for becoming Japan's first female prime minister.Notably, according to a White House readout, that lunch was \"American rice and American beef, deliciously made with Japanese ingredients\" - a move that will no doubt have delighted Trump, who has long demanded that Japan buy rice from the US.China controls the rare earths the world buys - can Trump's new deals change that?Takaichi also accompanied Trump aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, where they were greeted by thousands of cheering American troops. Takaichi took the stage and praised what she called the  \"greatest alliance in the world\" and pledged to increase defence spending.Trump has in the past criticised Japan's lack of defence spending. In April this year, he lambasted a security treaty with Japan as being \"one-sided\", saying: \"We pay billions of dollars to defend them, but they don't pay anything.\"Ahead of their meeting on Wednesday, Trump said he was sure that he would have a \"fantastic relationship\" with Takaichi, who had a strong connection with former PM Shinzo Abe, a Trump favourite who was shot dead in 2022.\"She was a great ally and friend of Abe, who was my friend… He was one of the best… I know they were very close, and I think philosophically they were close, which is very good,\" he told reporters while flying over to Japan from Malaysia on Tuesday.Trump is spending a week in Asia. He will leave Japan for South Korea on Wednesday, and is expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping there on Thursday.Getty ImagesDonald Trump met Sanae Takaichi, Japan's new prime minister, on the visitThe meeting with Trump was seen as a critical early test for Takaichi, who was elected as prime minister by Japanese lawmakers earlier this month.Both countries have long been allies, but navigating a relationship with a fickle Trump, who has in the past appeared to waver in his commitment to Japan, lies at the core of the country's foreign policy.On Wednesday, Takaichi described Trump as a \"partner in a new golden era\", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East. She announced that Japan would be nominating him for the Nobel peace prize.She also presented Trump with a collection of golf-related gifts, according to Trump's assistant Margo Martin.These included a golf bag signed by Hideki Matsuyama, the first male Japanese golfer to win a major golf championship, as well as a putter used by Abe. They also signed two caps printed with the words: Japan is back.In turn, Trump described her as a \"close friend\" and described the US alliance with Japan as a \"beautiful friendship\" that was \"born out of the ashes of a terrible war\". He also announced he had approved the first delivery of long-awaited US missiles for F-35 fighter jets to Japan, which would take place this week.Pleasantries have set a positive tone to the meetings so far,  but behind the smiles and the pagentary, there is real pressure on Japan.During the working lunch, Takaichi presented Trump with a map showing the investments that Japanese companies have made in the US. And during his speech on the USS George Washington, Trump said Takaichi had told him earlier about plans for Toyota to put $10bn (£7.5bn) into building plants \"all over\" the US.But Trump also wants more access to Japan's markets - not just getting them to buy more rice, but also soybeans, and to open its market to US vehicles.Getty ImagesThe US president was hosted in the ornate Akasaka PalaceBut Takaichi also needs to protect domestic industries and doesn't want to anger crucial interest groups at home, like the powerful farming lobby.Tokyo is heavily reliant on exports, and cannot afford a tariff fight especially when it comes to its auto industry. Automakers - the country's largest exporters to the US - faced 24% tariffs and tens of billions of dollars in losses.Tariffs have now been lowered to 15%, in step with rivals in the region such as South Korea.Tomohiko Taniguchi - former special adviser to  Abe - said there were things that Takaichi could draw on from Trump's relationship with her late mentor. He said it was important for Takaichi to be \"straightforward and say bluntly what Japan's national interests are, and to see where those two nations national interests overlap, and always mindful that Japan's safety must be in hands of the Japanese\".But Takaichi won't just have to balance Japan's interests and its alliance with the US – she'll also have to do that while maintaining the country's crucial trade partnership with China.Rintaro Nishimura senior associate at the Asia Group said: \"Takaichi will have to walk a very fine line, maybe tone down some of her more hawkish tendencies on China... but also assure Trump that the US-Japan relationship is the most important.\"",

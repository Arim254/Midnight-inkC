    "body": "17 hours agoGeorgina Rannard and BBC climate team,Belém, BrazilThe UN climate talks COP30 have been evacuated due to a fire breaking out inside the venue in Belém, Brazil.BBC journalists saw flames and smoke in the pavilion area before they were rushed outside where fire engines raced past.The UN said the fire was extinguished after six minutes and 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation. It is not yet known what caused the blaze. The talks were in the final hours of trying to agree on next steps to tackle climate change but the fire has disrupted negotiations and the talks remain closed.\"It was climbing the walls and onto the ceiling. People were screaming,\" Dr Harshita Umesh, who was giving a talk next to the place where they fire broke out, told BBC News.\"Then I ran, I think I tripped and fell.\"Dr Umesh, who is a medical doctor, said that ambulance staff told her that first responders inhaled \"toxic fumes\" and were given oxygen masks to the site.Emergency medicine specialist Kimberly Humphrey, currently helping patients at the COP medical centre, told the BBC that the injuries are \"Mainly people with smoke inhalation, someone with a lung injury from smoke.\"\"People are pretty traumatised and shocked,\" she added.\"There's a huge panic, people have been running out of here, it's a very dramatic moment... UN security guards are telling us to leave,\" said BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt shortly after the fire broke out.\"You can see huge columns of smoke rising up into the air through the hole that's been burnt in the top of the conference centre,\" he said.BBC journalists saw two ambulances driving towards the entrance more than 90 minutes after the fire started.A Brazilian security officer putting a chain through the gates of the venue with a chain told the BBC the premises must be evacuated and locked. After the fire broke out, orange flames burned a hole through the sheeting that covers the venue, which is in a former aerodrome. One video shows a man spraying a fire extinguisher at the fire before running away.One eyewitness told the BBC that he believes an electrical fire was the cause.A woman was taken away in a wheelchair, but it is not clear if that was connected to the fire.Hundreds of people were left sitting on the floor or on plastic chairs outside in high temperatures and humidity. The fire is likely to delay the closing of a deal in the talks.A number of country delegations were forced to take shelter outside under the roof of a petrol station, a member of the UK delegation told the BBC. He said the fire halted negotiations.The UN, which runs COP climate meetings, said the fire brigade is checking the venue to assess safety and that the summit has been temporarily taken over by Brazilian authorities.Thousands of people are attending the UN climate talks, including members of delegations from around the world.Nearly 200 countries are trying to agree on how to make progress in tackling climate change.

    "body": "More than 250 people have been arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of President Donald Trump's escalating crackdown on undocumented immigration, US officials say. Charlotte is the latest US city that Trump has targeted with federal troops, following similar measures in bigger cities like Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that those arrested are criminals and gang members.But local lawmakers and residents have railed against the detainments, which the federal government has dubbed \"Operation Charlotte's Web\". The state's Democratic governor has alleged people are being targeted because of their race. In a statement released on Wednesday, a DHS spokesperson said the operation has led to the arrest of \"some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens\", including gang members. Others arrested had been convicted of a range of crimes, including assault on law enforcement, driving while intoxicated, theft and tampering with government documents, the department said earlier.North Carolina's Democratic Governor Josh Stein, who has denounced Trump's operations, accused agents of racially profiling residents. \"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin colour, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots,\" Stein said on Sunday. \"This is not making us safer.\"The city's mayor, also a Democrat, urged federal agents to operate with \"respect\" for the city's values. She also commended those who came out in droves on Saturday to protest the Trump administration's actions in the city. \"I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I've seen,\" Mayor Vi Lyles said. \"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: you are not alone. Your city stands with you.\" DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown started in September and is still ongoing. Like other cities subject to immigration crackdowns, some migrants in Charlotte are staying home for fear of federal agents in the city, according to local media reports.Stein says he's monitoring reports that the operation will come to Raleigh, another North Carolina city, next. \"Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,\" he wrote.",

    "body": "Armed men posing as officials from India's central bank have robbed a vehicle transporting 70m rupees ($800,000; £600,000) in the southern state of Karnataka, police say.A massive operation has been launched to find the men who robbed the van in the heart of Bengaluru city in daylight.The robbery occurred on Wednesday afternoon. Six men in an SUV stopped a cash transport van on a busy road as it was moving money between bank branches, Bengaluru police commissioner Seemant Kumar Singh told the BBC.The van was carrying a driver, a cash custodian and two armed security guards.Mr Singh says the robbers told the people in the van that they were officials from the Reserve Bank of India and needed to verify if they had the correct documents to transport such a huge amount of money. The gang told the cash custodian and guards to leave their weapons in the van and get into the SUV, while the driver was instructed to continue driving with the cash, police said.The SUV followed the cash van for a few kilometres before the gang forced the driver out of the van, made the cash custodian and guards get out of the SUV, transferred the cash at gunpoint, and fled.The area had little CCTV coverage, and police are investigating if the gang used multiple vehicles in the operation.The cash transportation service company has filed a police complaint.The SUV used in the heist had a fake number plate and a sticker that read \"Government of India\", a police official told the BBC on condition of anonymity. The official added that police were also investigating if the company employees had anything to do with the heist.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah told reporters that police have recovered the SUV used in the heist.But Home Minister G Parameshwara has said that it is not yet clear which vehicle the suspects had used to escape. \"It was verified that they changed vehicles and moved the money,\" he told reporters.He said he was confident police would solve the case soon, as they had with other recent high-profile bank robberies in Karnataka.In May, 59kg of gold worth 532.6m rupees was stolen from a Vijayapura district bank using a duplicate locker key. Police have since recovered 39kg of gold and some cash, and arrested 15 people, including two former employees.",

    "body": "The owner of the Fukushima nuclear power plant is edging closer to having one of its reactors restarted for the first time since the 2011 disaster.Hideyo Hanazumi, the governor of the Niigata region, where Japan's largest nuclear power plant is located said the prefecture would give its consent for restart.It will need final approval from Japan's nuclear regulator before the plan to resume operations at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa facility, operated by Tepco, goes ahead.If approved, it would be the first time Tepco has been allowed to recommence nuclear reactor operations in Japan since its Fukushima plant went into meltdown following a tsunami.Residents in Niigata are divided over whether the plant should be restarted or not.Hanazumi told a news conference on Friday that, once approved, the decision would then be discussed in December at a prefectural government assembly, where he would seek the assembly's approval. The approval would be for the recommencement of operations at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant's No 6 reactor, followed by the No 7.The resumption of operations at the facility is part of Tepco's business reconstruction plan following the Fukushima meltdown - when the plant's reactors were flooded, causing radiation to leak out and forcing 150,000 people to be evacuated from the area.Eighteen-thousand people were killed in the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami that preceded it.Following the disaster, Tepco was ordered to pay trillions of Japanese yen in damages to those affected and is also paying for the plant's decommissioning costs.A survey released by Niigata prefecture last month suggested 50% of the its residents supported the plant's restart, while 47% were against it. It also indicated that almost 70% of people in the prefecture were concerned about Tepco running the plant. Fourteen nuclear reactors have already resumed operations in Japan since the Fukushima disaster. Friday's decision demonstrates Japan's desire to move towards increased use of atomic energy to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels as it pursues a goal of net zero carbon emissions.",

    "body": "Spain's Attorney General, Álvaro García Ortiz, has been forced to step down after being found guilty of revealing confidential information in a deeply controversial case, which accentuated the country's political division.The Supreme Court found that García Ortiz had unlawfully revealed details of the tax status of businessman Alberto González Amador, boyfriend of a senior conservative politician. The court handed him a two-year ban from the post and a fine of €7,200 (£6,438). He must also pay €10,000 to Mr González Amador as compensation.The trial of García Ortiz fuelled already acrimonious relations between the left-wing government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and right-wing opposition.Their contrasting positions were underlined by reactions to the conviction.\"Sánchez must apologise to Spaniards, resign and call elections, in that order,\" said Ester Muñoz, spokeswoman for the conservative People's Party.The government said it did not agree with the ruling but respected it and would proceed with the appointment of a new attorney general.However, a number of politicians on the left expressed outrage at what they saw as a politically motivated ruling.Health Minister Mónica García, of the Sumar party, said the conviction dealt a \"lethal blow to [the concept of] presumption of innocence\" and threw ordinary Spaniards \"under the bus\" when it came to the rule of law.The complex case dates back to March 2024, when the attorney general's office issued a press release stating that Mr González Amador had requested a plea bargain after being found to have evaded tax payments worth €350,951. The document corrected mistaken press reports stating that the attorney general's office had proposed the bargain.The source of the incorrect reports was the head of communications of the conservative regional president of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Ms Díaz Ayuso is the partner of Mr González Amador.Mr González Amador filed a complaint against the attorney general, claiming his privacy had been breached. The case against García Ortiz also saw him accused of leaking information about the affair to the media. Prosecutors pointed to the attorney general's decision to change his phone as incriminating.However, there was no direct evidence linking García Ortiz to the leak and several journalists testified during the trial that he had not been the source of their information. Regarding the press statement, the attorney general said he was simply correcting the erroneous reports.García Ortiz can appeal against the ruling.This comes as a severe blow for the prime minister, who has been under judicial pressure on various fronts. His brother is due to go on trial for influence peddling, his wife is under investigation for her business activities and two former senior figures in the Socialist Party, José Luis Ábalos and Santos Cerdán, are accused of overseeing a massive kickback scheme.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondent, in KyivUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been careful not to criticise or reject this US draft peace deal - even though it appears to heavily reflect many of Moscow's demands. On Thursday, the White House pushed back on claims Ukraine was not involved in the drafting of the plan, which emerged after meetings between the US and Russia.In his nightly address, Zelensky said Ukraine needed peace and would engage in diplomacy and issue no rash statements. He said Ukraine was \"ready for constructive, honest and efficient work\".But there is deep concern about some of the reported proposals, including giving up the entire Donbas region, reducing the size of Ukraine's military, and ruling out the presence of international troops in the country - concessions which Ukraine has rejected in the past.Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Yurchyshyn told the Kyiv Independent that Washington wanted a \"quick peace at the expense of one side, which they consider weaker\".Recent events may have further weakened Ukraine's position. Russia has made further advances in the east of the country. Moscow's long-range strikes on Ukraine's grid has left most of the country facing power cuts. Allegations of serious corruption in Ukraine's government have also led to political infighting and diverted attention from the war. All these issues are impossible to ignore in both Washington and Moscow.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that peace will require difficult decisions on both sides. A draft published in the media does include a promise of \"reliable security guarantees\" for Ukraine.It's believed to suggest some frozen Russian assets should be used to help rebuild Ukraine. While the draft rules out Ukraine's membership of the Nato military alliance, it keeps the door open for its membership of the European Union.Europe itself appears to have had little say over the drafting of this plan. There's no mention of the efforts led by the UK and France to provide an international reassurance force in Ukraine, should there be a ceasefire. The draft explicitly rules out the presence of foreign troops. Europe wants its voice heard. Pressure from European allies could still help Zelensky alter the draft proposals.But there may not be much time. US officials who presented the plan, approved by US President Donald Trump, are said to be working to an aggressive timetable - weeks, not months. They're expected to travel to Moscow soon. Any hopes of getting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky in the same room to negotiate appears to have been abandoned.Trump, who's often claimed he can quickly end the war, seems to be running out of patience. He just wants the two sides to sign up to a deal.",

    "body": "11 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondentThe \"swarm\" of tens of thousands of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini earlier this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered.They used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust. They used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them.One of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions.The seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor between the two islands of Santorini and Anydros.The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"For now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"Volcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.And these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA surrealist painting by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo has sold for $54.7m (£41.8m) - shattering the auction record for an artwork by a woman. The painting, from the 1940s, went for more than 1,000 times its original auction price in 1980, after a tense bidding battle between two collectors, according to the auction house Sotheby's.The work - titled El sueño (la cama), which is translated to The dream (The bed)  - depicts Kahlo asleep in a canopy bed beneath a skeleton entwined with dynamite.The auction broke the previous record figure for a female artist's work of $44m, as well as for the highest amount paid for a Kahlo portrait - $34.9 million in 2021.The self-portrait is one of Kahlo's \"psychologically charged\" artworks, Sotheby's said, and was painted during a turbulent chapter in her life - the year her former lover was assassinated, and shortly after her divorce and remarriage.Kahlo, who died in 1954, is widely regarded as one of the greatest painters in the past century and became known for her personal portraits.Her work often conveyed her painful relationship with her body, disabled through polio in her childhood and serious injuries following a bus accident.Few could have imagined El sueño (la cama) would eventually sell for $55m when it was first went under the hammer at Sotheby's for $51,000 in 1980, the auction house's head of Latin American art Anna Di Stasi said. \"This record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" she added.The previous highest price at auction for a work by a female artist is Georgia O'Keeffe's Jimson Weed / White Flower No.1, which was sold at Sotheby's in 2014 for $44m.El sueño (la cama) is one of the few Kahlo paintings in the public market since the Mexican authorities declared her artworks as artistic monuments in the 1980s, preventing them from being exported without authorisation.Kahlo's story was adapted into a biographical film starring Salma Hayek in 2002, telling the story of her rocky relationship with her husband, artist Diego Rivera, and her injuries.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesTwitch is the latest platform to be included in Australia's teen social media banTwitch, a streaming platform popular with gamers, has been added to Australia's  teen social media ban which starts next month.It joins other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok and Snapchat that must ensure under-16s cannot open accounts and existing ones are closed from 10 December.Australia's internet regulator overseeing the ban said Twitch - owned by Amazon -has been included as its main purpose was \"online social interaction\" where users were encouraged to chat to each other about posted content.A Twitch spokesperson said Australians under 16 will not be able to open a Twitch account from 10 December, and from 9 January, existing under-16s accounts will be deactivated.On her reasons why Twitch had been included, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it was \"a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted\".No more platforms are expected to be added to the ban before the start date next month, Ms Inman Grant said. The government has previously said the ban is aimed at reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, including harmful content.Founded in 2007, Twitch is a popular livestreaming platform, where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers.Last year, it launched plans to share more of its revenue with creators as part of a shake-up, allowing streamers to make money through fans subscribing to their channel.The revenue is split equally between Twitch and the creator, after fees are paid.Twitch's policy forbids anyone under 13 to use its platform and users aged between 13 and the legal age of adulthood in their country can join if they have permission from their parent or guardian.Ms Inman Grant also said on Friday that Pinterest, where users compile online notice boards of images, would not be included in the ban because its core purpose was not about online social interaction.Instead, the platform was \"more commonly used by individuals collating images for inspiration and idea curation,\" she said.Australia's world-first under-16s social media ban also includes YouTube, Reddit, Kick, Threads and X.The ban means tech companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to stop under-16s from using their platforms or risk being fined up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m).Earlier this week, Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads - announced it would start closing accounts of teenagers under 16 from 4 December, a week before the official ban. It's not clear how companies will enforce the ban but some possibilities included the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.",

    "body": "Raccoons may be inching closer to becoming America's next pet.Affectionately referred to as trash pandas, the masked mammals known for rummaging rubbish bins for easy food, are evolving based on their proximity to humans, even starting to look cuter, a new study says. Evaluation of nearly 20,000 photos found \"a clear reduction in snout length\" in urban raccoons compared to their rural cousins - a physical shift consistent with the early stages of domestication seen in cats and dogs.Some that have been adopted as pets have become TikTok celebrities. One particularly bold dumpster-diver even sprinted across the pitch during a Major League Soccer match in Philadelphia last year.The stripe-tailed mammals, also nicknamed \"backyard bandits\", are widespread across the contiguous US. Their ability to thrive in both wild and urban settings has left them occupying an unusual space in American life - beloved pet in some neighbourhoods, persistent pest in others.The proximity to humans could signal that the creatures are growing more comfortable around us, or, scientifically speaking, dampening their innate flight responses, according to the study published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.The softening of their features could be due to shifts in their fight-or-flight response on the cellular level, it says.This urban domestication starts with trash, the study's co-author, Raffaela Lesch of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, told Scientific American.\"Trash is really the kickstarter,\" she said. \"Wherever humans go, there's trash — and animals love our trash.\"But to take advantage of this endless buffet, wildlife must strike a delicate balance: bold enough to root through bins and navigate human environments, yet not so bold as to pose a threat. \"If you have an animal that lives close to humans, you have to be well-behaved enough,\" Lesch said. \"That selection pressure is quite intense.\"The finding, the authors said, is consistent with the \"domestication syndrome phenotype\". Domestication syndrome - anatomical and morphological changes such as curly tails, floppy ears, depigmentation, smaller brains and reduced facial skeletons - are commonly cited as some of the most salient traits, the study says. Those traits are also seen among more common household pets, such as dogs that evolved from wolves.The study's authors also hypothesised that the domestication process is wrongly believed to be initiated by humans, who have captured or selectively bred animals in the past. The process might actually begin much earlier than previously thought, they said, notably when animals became habituated to human environments.\"Only animals with dampened flight (or fight) responses would succeed best,\" the authors wrote. \"This makes the initial stages of the domestication process a process of pure natural selection.\"",

    "body": "One of the world's first calculating machines will not go to auction as scheduled in France, after a Paris court provisionally blocked the historic item from being exported.Auction house Christie's has confirmed it will not proceed with bidding for the machine La Pascaline, developed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal in 1642.Valuations suggested the machine could fetch €2m to 3m (£1.7m to £2.6m), and Christie's called it the \"most important scientific instrument ever offered at auction\".Scientists and researchers made a legal appeal to grant heritage protections to the historic instrument, arguing it should be classified as a \"national treasure\".Pascal was just 19 years old when he developed the earliest version of a calculator, Christie's said. There are only nine of these machines still in existence.\"It is the first attempt in history to substitute the human mind with a machine,\" the official collection description reads.\"Its invention marks a breakthrough, a 'quantum leap' whose importance and significance take on a very special meaning today.\"La Pascaline was exhibited at Christie's venues in New York and Hong Kong throughout the year. The machine was included in Christie's auction of the library of the late Catalonia collector Léon Parcé, which also featured Pascal's philosophical piece Pensées and the first printed version of \"Pascal's wager\".On Wednesday, a Paris administrative court temporarily blocked an earlier export authorisation provided by France's culture minister in May. Two experts had signed off on the minister's certificate, including one from the Louvre Museum.The judge concluded there were \"serious doubts\" over the legality of the certificate, a statement from the Paris court said, adding the decision was provisional until a final judgment is delivered.In a statement to the AFP news agency, a Christie's spokesperson said: \"Given the provisional nature of this decision and in accordance with the instructions of its client, Christie's is suspending the sale of La Pascaline.\" The court noted La Pascaline's historic and scientific value could qualify it as a \"national treasure\", guaranteeing protections under France's heritage code.The French heritage group Association Sites & Monuments, which was listed as an applicant in the court filing, welcomed the decision.Additional reporting by Sebastian Usher, Global Affairs reporter",

    "body": "7 hours agoTom BatemanState Department correspondent, Washington DCCountries enforcing race or gender diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies will now be at risk of the Trump administration deeming them as infringing on human rights.The State Department is issuing the new rules to all US embassies and consulates involved in compiling its annual report on global human rights abuses.The new instructions also deem countries that subsidise abortion or facilitate mass migration as infringing on human rights.The changes, which the State Department says are intended to stop \"destructive ideologies\", have been condemned by rights campaigners who argue the Trump administration is re-defining long-established human rights principles to pursue ideological goals.The changes reflect a major shift in Washington's established focus on global human rights protection, and signal the expansion into foreign policy of the Trump administration's domestic agenda on issues that have become a lightning rod of division in the US over recent years.A senior State Department official said the new rules were \"a tool to change the behaviour of governments\".DEI policies were designed with the objective of improving outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups. Since assuming office, US President Donald Trump has aggressively sought to terminate DEI and restore what he calls merit-based opportunity in the US.The senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: \"The United States remains committed to the Declaration of Independence's recognition that all men are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights.\" The official added that rights were \"given to us by God, our creator, not by governments\".Other policies by foreign governments which US embassies will be told to categorise as human rights infringements include:Subsidising abortions, \"as well as the total estimated number of annual abortions\"Gender-transition surgery for children, defined by the state department as \"operations involving chemical or surgical mutilation... to modify their sex\"Facilitating mass or illegal migration \"across a country's territory into other countries\"Arrests or \"official investigations or warnings for speech\" - a reference to the Trump administration's opposition to internet safety laws adopted by some European countries to deter online hate speechState Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said the new instructions are intended to stop \"new destructive ideologies [that] have given safe harbour to human rights violations\".He said: \"The Trump administration will not allow these human rights violations, such as the mutilation of children, laws that infringe on free speech, and racially discriminatory employment practices, to go unchecked.\" He added: \"Enough is enough.\"Critics have accused the administration of redefining long-established universal human rights principles to pursue its own ideological goals.Uzra Zeya, a former senior State Department official who now runs the charity Human Rights First, said the Trump administration was \"weaponising international human rights for domestic partisan ends\". \"Attempting to label DEI as a human rights violation sets a new low in the Trump administration's weaponization of international human rights,\" she said.She added that the new instructions excluded the rights of \"women, LGBTQI+ persons, religious and ethnic minorities, and non-believers - all of whom enjoy equal rights under US and international law, despite the meandering and obtuse rights rhetoric of the Trump Administration\".The new rules conveyed \"jaw-dropping\" animosity towards LGBTQI+ people, Ms Zeya added. The State Department's annual human rights report has been seen historically as the most comprehensive study of its kind by any government. It has documented abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killing and political persecution of minorities. Much of its focus and scope had remained broadly similar across Republican and Democrat administrations.The new instructions follow the Trump administration's publication of the latest annual report in August, which was significantly rewritten and downscaled compared to those of previous years.It reduced criticism of some US allies while escalating disapproval of perceived foes. Entire sections included in reports from previous years were eliminated, dramatically reducing coverage of issues including government corruption and persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals.The report also said the human rights situation had \"worsened\" in some European democracies, including the UK, France and Germany, due to laws against online hate speech. The language in the report echoed previous criticism by some US tech bosses who oppose online harm reduction laws, portraying them as attacks on free speech.",

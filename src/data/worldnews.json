    "body": "German nurse gets life in jail after murdering 10 to reduce workload18 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesA palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of the murder of 10 patients and the attempted murder of 27 others.Prosecutors alleged that the man, who has not been publicly named, injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives in an effort to ease his workload during shifts overnight.The offences were committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, in western Germany. Investigators are reported to be looking into several other suspicious cases during his career.According to media outlet Agence France-Presse (AFP), the unnamed man had been employed at the hospital in Wuerselen since 2020, after completing training as a nursing professional in 2007. Prosecutors told a court in Aachen that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\". The court was told that he injected patients with large doses of morphine and midazolam, a type of sedative, in an effort to reduce his workload during night shifts.He was arrested in 2024.When issuing the life sentence, the court said that the man's crimes carried a \"particular severity of guilt\" which should bar him from early release after 15 years.He will be able to appeal the verdict.Prosecutors have told AFP that exhumations are taking place to identify further potential victims, which could see the man put on trial again.The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany. A court found that he administered lethal doses of heart medication to people in his care between 1999 and 2005.He is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.",

    "body": "23 hours agoWill GrantCentral America and Cuba correspondentMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. In the video, a man approaches her from behind and attempts to kiss her on the neck and place his hands on her body. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken. The offender has been arrested.\"My view is, if I don't file a complaint, what will happen to other Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what will happen to all women in our country?\" Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday.\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" she said. \"I have experienced it before, when I wasn't president, when I was a student.\"She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.\"A line must be drawn,\" she said.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman. Femicide is also a huge problem in Mexico, with a staggering 98% of gender-based murders estimated to go unpunished.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events. On occasion, that has presented security concerns for her team. However, she confirmed in her new conference she had no intention of changing her policy of interacting with her supporters.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels. Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.Since taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump.",

    "body": "14 minutes agoLily Jamali,in San Francisco and Aoife Walsh,in WashingtonNancy Pelosi has announced her retirement from Congress, ending a decades-long career that saw the California Democrat become one of the most powerful figures in US politics.In a video message on Thursday, Pelosi said she will not be seeking re-election to Congress at the end of her term in January 2027.It marks the end of a storied political career: Pelosi, 85, became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House and led her party in the lower chamber of Congress from 2003 until 2023.\"We have made history, we have made progress,\" Pelosi said in her message. \"We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"\"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" Pelosi added.Pelosi was first elected to Congress to represent San Francisco in 1987 aged 47, and quickly rose through the ranks. She was elected by her party to be speaker of the House in 2007, becoming the first woman to serve in that role. She served until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the lower chamber, before returning to the speaker's chair from 2019 to 2023.Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line to the presidency.In that role, Pelosi played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents during her long career on Capitol Hill.She is widely credited with marshalling the passage of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation, as well as bills to address infrastructure and climate change during Joe Biden's presidency.Pelosi also directly challenged Donald Trump throughout his presidency, famously ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address behind his back.By then she was also a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform.She led two impeachment efforts against Trump - the first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. Trump was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Biden, and of using military aid as leverage. He was later acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.The second was in 2021, when he was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. That effort ultimately failed and Trump was acquitted once again.On Thursday, when asked about Pelosi's retirement, Trump said she was \"an evil woman\".\"I'm glad she's retiring. I think she did the country a great service by retiring,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I think she was a tremendous liability for the country.\"After Trump's first term, Pelosi worked with Biden to shepherd much of his legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins.In less than two years, Democrats in the House pushed through a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage.She was succeeded as Democratic leader in the House by New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries in 2022.Since leaving her speakership, she has remained a major political influence. Most recently, she played a key role in helping to pass Proposition 50 in California -  a state redistricting effort aimed at flipping five House seats to Democrats during the midterms in 2026.",

    "body": "Attackers have boarded a ship off the coast of Somalia after firing machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades at the vessel, according to a UK maritime agency.Greek shipping company Latsco Marine Management confirmed the attack on a ship carrying gasoline, saying all the ship's 24 crew were \"safe and accounted for\" and \"we remain in close contact with them\".The crew have taken shelter in the ship's fortified safe room, Reuters news agency quotes an official from maritime security company Diaplous as saying. European Union naval forces operating in the area have been asked for assistance, Reuters says.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) says the raid happened about 560 nautical miles south-east of the Somali town of Eyl. \"The Master of a vessel has reported being approached by one small craft on its stern. The small craft fired small arms and RPGs towards the vessel,\" UKMTO said in a statement.Private security firm Ambrey said the attackers were probably Somali pirates, who have been active in the region in recent days.According to Latsco, the attack on the Malta-registered vessel occurred at around 11:48 local time (08:48GMT). \"[Latsco] has activated its emergency response team and is coordinating with the relevant authorities to ensure the continued safety and welfare of the crew,\" it said.The vessel, named Hellas Aphrodite, was built in 2016, and was en route from Sikka, India, to Durban, South Africa, it saidThe attack comes amid a resurgence of piracy in the region, which had declined after peaking more than a decade ago.There were at least seven reported incidents last year, and several fishing vessels have already been seized by pirates this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau.",

    "body": "A Ukrainian court has handed down the first jail sentence for life against a Russian soldier accused of killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war.Dmitry Kurashov, 27, was found guilty of shooting dead Vitalii Hodniuk, a veteran 41-year-old Ukrainian soldier who had surrendered following capture in 2024.Ukraine's national police said that \"expert reports, witness testimony and video footage from the scene confirmed that the Russian soldier deliberately killed the POW on the orders of his commanders, who had instructed troops not to take Ukrainian soldiers captive\".In a months-long trial which began earlier this year, the court heard how Kurashov's unit stormed a Ukrainian position in the region of Zaporizhzhia on the morning of 6 January 2024.The prosecution said that although Hodniuk crawled out of a dugout unarmed and surrendered, Kurashov shot him point-blank with several aimed AK-47 shots – a violation of the laws of war.Kurashov and the rest of his unit were later overpowered by Ukrainian forces and taken as prisoners of war.Kurashov initially pleaded guilty but later retracted, saying he had only done so to expedite the trial in the hope that he would be released in a prisoner swap. He maintained it was a Russian medic – who later died – who fired the shots that killed Hodniuk.His version was refuted by other members of his own unit who were later captured by Ukrainian troops and were also being held as prisoners of war.They said they saw Hodniuk emerge from the foxhole unarmed with his hands up after Kurashov called for Ukrainians to come out of their foxholes and surrender.Although they did not witness the shooting because there were explosions at the same moment, all three said nobody but Kurashov had been around when they heard the gunshots. One said the medic accused by Kurashov was not present on the scene when the killing occurred.Kurashov himself never testified. According to court reporters, his lawyer Anna Karpenko said her client \"sincerely repented\" and that he believed he had simply been following orders from above not to take any prisoners.Nikita Manevsky, the prosecutor who pushed for the harshest sentence, had argued Kurashov had showed \"no remorse\" and \"nothing but indifference\" during the trial.Earlier this year, Kurashov told the BBC he had joined the Storm V assault unit in exchange for early release from a remote penal colony in Russia where he was serving a sentence for theft. Representatives from the Russian military told the convicts that if they joined the army and went to Ukraine their sentences would be expunged, Kurashov said.The recruitment of prisoners to fight in the war in Ukraine – which Russia calls a \"special military operation\" – is a known practice.Convicts who sign up are sent to join the generally poorly trained Storm V penal military units. Its troops are often employed to join \"meat grinder\" assaults on the front line – a tactic which sees waves of soldiers push forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery.In May the Ukrainian intelligence directorate (HUR) said it had recorded more than 150 cases of battlefield executions of POWs by Russian soldiers since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Last year the head of the War Department at the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office told the BBC that executions of prisoners of war by Russian forces had \"clear signs of being part of a policy\" as they were happening across vast areas.Ukrainian forces have also been accused of executing Russian prisoners of war, but the number of such claims has been much smaller.",

    "body": "COP30: World leaders take aim at Trump for climate inaction40 minutes agoEsme Stallard,Climate and science reporter, BBC News and Matt McGrath,Environment correspondent, BBC NewsPablo Porciuncula/AFPBrazilian President Lula warned of \"extremist forces\" when he addressed world leaders at the global climate summitPresident Trump was under attack on Thursday as world leaders lined up to criticise his stance on climate change ahead of the global COP30 summit.The US leader, who is absent from the gathering in the Amazonian city of Belém, was called a liar for his rejection of climate science and \"against humankind\" for his rollback of key climate policies.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the waning political consensus on the issue. He said climate change was once a unity issue but \"today however, sadly that consensus is gone\".Over the next two weeks countries will try and negotiate a new deal on climate change, with a particular focus on channelling more money to forest protection.Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit.And whilst President Donald Trump isn't attending this meeting in Belém, his views on climate change are certainly on the minds of many of the other leaders present.Speaking at the UN in September, the US president said that climate change was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\", and refuted the use of renewable energy. He said: \"The entire globalist concept, asking successful industrialised nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies, must be rejected completely and totally.\"Without naming the US leader, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil warned on Thursday of \"extremist forces that fabricate fake news and are condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming\".The leaders of Chile and Colombia went further, calling the US president a liar, and asking other countries to ignore US efforts to move away from climate action.Maisa Rojas, Chile's environment minister, told the BBC: \"The science is very clear. It is very important not to falsify the truth.\"But while Trump-bashing went down well with the audience, getting agreement on new steps to tackle warming is proving much harder.Only a few dozen leaders have turned up here in Belém, and a majority of countries have failed to submit new plans to cut carbon emissions, the root cause of rising temperatures.AFP via Getty ImagesOuteiro Port in Belém was recently expanded to accommodate cruise ships acting as \"floating hotels\" for COP30 delegatesDespite UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledging that global political support for the climate movement is waning, he told the gathering of those that were present: \"My message is that the UK is all-in.\"However, on Wednesday night, in a blow to the Brazilian hosts, the UK chose to opt out of its flagship $125bn (£95bn) fund to support the world's rainforests.President Lula hoped that $25bn could be raised for the Tropical Forests Forever Facility from public sources – mainly from developed countries like the UK – to support governments and communities protecting the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin.The protection of these ecosystems is crucial for tackling climate change - they cover just 6% of the world's land, yet store billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases and host half of the planet's species.The move by the UK has come as a surprise as it had been heavily involved in the fund's design, and launched a global commitment for countries to halt deforestation by 2030 when it hosted the COP summit in Glasgow in 2021.Lord Zach Goldsmith, who worked on the issue when he was former environment minister, told the BBC's PM programme: \"The assumption was that the UK would be a leading participant and at the last minute the UK has walked away. It has caused real frustration to put it mildly here in Brazil... the Brazilian government behind the scenes is furious.\"The decision also seems at odds with the stance of the Prince of Wales. Also addressing leaders on Thursday he declared the fund \"a visionary step toward valuing nature's role in climate stability\" and shortlisted it for his £1m Earthshot Prize.COP26: World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030ReutersResearchers at Imperial College believe climate change increased the extreme rainfall associated with Hurricane Melissa, which caused at least 30 deaths and widespread flooding in Haiti (pictured)Prince William tried to encourage leaders to overcome their differences and move forward with action. \"I have long believed in the power of urgent optimism: the conviction that, even in the face of daunting challenges, we have the ingenuity and determination to make a difference, and to do so now,\" he said.And he urged them to take action for the sake of their children and grandchildren.\"Let us rise to this moment with the clarity that history demands of us. Let us be the generation that turned the tide - not for applause, but for the quiet gratitude of those yet to be born,\" he said.From Monday, countries will spend two weeks negotiating further action on climate change - with crucial questions on how to raise finance previously pledged for those already affected by the worst impacts of climate change.The last few weeks have seen devastating extreme weather globally. Hurricane Melissa, which hit the Caribbean last week, is one of the strongest the island nations have ever experienced - resulting in the deaths of more than 75 people. Recent analysis from Imperial College has suggested that climate change increased the extreme rainfall associated with the Category 5 hurricane by 16%.Additional reporting by Ione Wells and Justin Rowlatt.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGrace Eliza Goodwin and Kwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonWatch: \"There will be frustration\" - Transport secretary outlines reduction in air trafficUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned that air travel capacity will be cut by up to 10% at 40 major airports over the coming days, if the government shutdown continues.The decision, which is expected to affect domestic flights only, was made because air traffic controllers had been reporting fatigue, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said at a briefing alongside Duffy.Some 1.4 million federal workers, from air traffic controllers to park wardens, are working without pay - or are on forced leave - because the US Congress has not agreed a federal funding budget.Major airports in Atlanta, New York and Washington DC will be affected by the reduction in service.Unions say many employees are becoming ill with stress or are being forced into taking second jobs. On Wednesday, the federal government funding impasse became the longest shutdown in US history.\"It is unusual,\" said FAA chief Bryan Bedford of the planned flight reductions, \"just as the shutdown is unusual, just as the fact that our controllers haven't been paid for a month is unusual.\"The flight reductions will be gradual, starting at 4% of domestic flights on Friday, then rising to 5% on Saturday and 6% on Sunday, before hitting the full 10% next week, Reuters news agency reported. The names of the affected airports - all high-traffic locations - will officially be released on Thursday.A list shared by a source with the BBC's US partner CBS includes some of the nation's busiest hubs. They include Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, New York John F Kennedy International, Chicago O'Hare International, Ronald Reagan Washington National, and Los Angeles International airports. The BBC has contacted the FAA and the transportation department for the official list.The cancellations could affect between 3,500 and 4,000 flights per day. US media also reported that international flights would not be affected.Low budget carrier Frontier Airlines warned customers to buy tickets at other airlines as a contingency plan.The reduction in service is needed to ensure the US airspace remained safe for passengers, the FAA said.In a statement, American Airlines, the second-largest carrier in North America, said it was waiting for more information from the FAA so it could determine which flights will be scrapped, but that \"we expect the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected\".Delta Air Lines told the BBC most of its flights would continue as scheduled, adding that all customers could change, cancel or refund their flights without penalty.Once government funds ran out on 1 October, most federal workers were sent home and told they would be paid once the government reopened. Those deemed essential, like controllers, though, had to keep doing their jobs without pay.Almost immediately after the shutdown started, airports began feeling the effects. Some had to ground flights for hours after air traffic controllers called out sick, while others relied on controllers from other airports.Duffy warned earlier this week that flight cancellations could be coming, as half the country's 30 major airports experienced staff shortages. Nick Daniels, the president of the labour union representing more than 20,000 aviation workers, put the situation into stark terms on Wednesday. \"Air traffic controllers are texting, 'I don't even have enough money to put gas in my car to come to work,'\" he told CNN. \"We base what we do day in and day out on predictability,\" he said. \"Right now there is no predictability.\"Writing recently for MSNBC, another controller, a single father, said he was working for food delivery service DoorDash after his daily air traffic shift ended, and was \"sleeping only two hours most nights\".\"Like many families, we didn't plan for a shutdown,\" he wrote. \"Yet the bills don't stop.\"Duffy previously said there was a risk that came with air traffic controllers taking on additional jobs during the shutdown, and had threatened to fire controllers who did not come to work.",

    "body": "18 hours agoLana LamSydneyPeter MumbyThe Great Barrier Reef has suffered mass bleaching events in recent yearsThe Great Barrier Reef is headed for a \"grim future\" and will suffer a \"rapid coral decline\" by 2050 but parts may recover if global warming is kept below 2C, a new study has found.Researchers at the University of Queensland (UQ) used modelling to simulate the lifecycles of certain coral species and found that some were better at adapting to warmer oceans and could help new coral grow.Reefs near cooler-water currents were also more resilient, giving a \"glimmer of hope\" to the natural wonder, which has suffered severe climate-induced heat stress in recent years.The study warned that curbing carbon emissions was crucial to allow coral to recover and avoid a \"near collapse\" of the reef.Dr Yves-Marie Bozec, who led the research, said the modelling of more than 3,800 individual reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef looked at their \"eco-evolutionary dynamics\". This included how corals interact with each other, how they deal with warmer water and corals in naturally cooler areas.\"We ran all of those factors with the most up-to-date climate projections - and the news was not good,\" he said.\"We forecast a rapid coral decline before the middle of this century regardless of the emissions scenario.\"The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems, stretching more than 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Australia's north-east coast.It has suffered four significant marine heatwaves between 2016 and 2022, causing much of its coral to expel the algae which gives them life and colour - a process called bleaching, which is often fatal.A recent report found that parts of the Great Barrier Reef had suffered the largest annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly 40 years ago.Dr Bozec said some parts of the reef \"may partially recover after 2050, but only if ocean warming is sufficiently slow to allow natural adaptation to keep pace with temperature changes\".\"Adaptation may keep pace if global warming does not exceed two degrees by 2100. For that to happen, more action is needed globally to reduce carbon emissions which are driving climate change.\"Dr Bozec said: \"The window for meaningful action is closing rapidly but it hasn't shut\".Under the Paris agreement, almost 200 nations have pledged to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and to keep them \"well below\" 2C above those recorded in pre-industrial times, generally considered to mean the late 19th Century.Prof Peter Mumby, who also worked on the study, said they found \"many reefs could persist under the Paris agreement target of two degrees of warming\".\"However, higher emissions leading to faster temperature rises would drive most reefs to a near collapse,\" he said. Prof Murphy said reefs in areas \"where the water doesn't heat up so dramatically because it is well mixed, fared better than others\" and reefs close to populations of corals that can regenerate were also healthier.Identifying areas of the reef network that are more resilient will mean efforts to protect the reef can focus on \"strategic parts\" of the ecosystem, he added.Watch: Can you un-bleach coral?

    "body": "22 hours agoIan AikmanSeveral contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation. At a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.Video of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online. The Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has condemned Mr Nawat's \"malicious\" behaviour, for which he has since apologised.The Miss Universe contestants, who are the winners of national pageants in their home countries, attended Tuesday's event in their sashes and gowns.Some can be heard shouting back at Mr Nawat in the video, after he raises his voice to reprimand Ms Bosch and repeatedly tells her to stop talking. As many of them stand to show support, Mr Nawat says: \"If anyone wants to continue the contest, sit down. If you step out, the rest of the girls continue.\"Despite this, the majority of the women in the video appear standing, with several heading towards the door.After leaving the event on Tuesday, Ms Bosch told the press the 60-year-old executive was \"not respectful\" and said he had called her \"dumb\". Mr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood. He is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying she had caused \"damage\".His conduct prompted a stern rebuke from the MUO, which has sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.In a video statement, MUO President Raul Rocha said Mr Nawat had \"forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\". He said the Thai official had \"humiliated, insulted and showed a lack of respect\" to Ms Bosch, and committed the \"serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenceless woman\".Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited \"as much as possible\" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking \"legal actions\" against him.\"I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,\" Mr Rocha said.RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA/ShutterstockFatima Bosch said Nawat Itsaragrisil was \"not respectful\" at the pre-pageant ceremony on TuesdayAmong those to walk out on Tuesday was reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. \"This is about women's rights,\" she said as she left the event. \"This is not how things should be handled. To trash another girl is beyond disrespectful... That's why I'm taking my coat and I'm walking out.\"Ms Bosch later said in an interview: \"I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard. It's here stronger than ever. I have a purpose. I have things to say.\"We're in the 21st century. I'm not a doll to be made up, styled and have my clothes changed,\" she added. \"I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I'm completely committed to that.\"Video of Mr Nawat has outraged fans of the pageant, with many heavily criticising his actions and praising Ms Bosch's response.In a social media video statement, Mr Nawat said: \"If anyone feels bad, uncomfortable, or affected, I apologise to everyone. I especially apologised to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.\"The Miss Universe competition has pressed on despite this controversy, with contestants taking part in a welcome event in Bangkok on Wednesday.The winner will be crowned the new Miss Universe on 21 November.RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA/ShutterstockThai businessman and media personality Nawat Itsaragrisil has apologised for the incident",

    "body": "3 hours agoBarbara Plett UsherAfrica correspondentAnadolu via Getty ImagesThe paramilitary group, led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has taken the city of el-Fasher after an 18-month siegeSudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has agreed to a proposal from the US for a humanitarian ceasefire, the group said on Thursday.Sudan's military-led government has not yet responded. The RSF issued the statement after seizing the city of el-Fasher in the western Darfur region.Their 18-month siege blocked humanitarian aid despite repeated UN appeals, causing starvation among residents unable to flee. A UN-backed global hunger monitor has confirmed famine conditions in the city.The RSF has been facing an international backlash over reports of mass killings by its foot soldiers, which it has denied. But it has admitted \"violations\" were committed by individuals and arrested some.Civil war broke out between Sudan's army and the RSF in April 2023. Both parties have agreed to various ceasefire proposals during the war, though none have stuck.In September, the US along with the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a transition to civilian rule.The RSF's statement said it had agreed to enter the truce proposed by the four countries \"in order to address the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of the war\" and to allow the \"urgent delivery\" of aid.The group also said it looked forward to discussions about ending hostilities \"in a manner that addresses the root causes of the conflicts\" and \"creates the appropriate environment for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace\".On Tuesday, before the RSF's statement, Sudan's Defence Minister Hassan Kabroun thanked US President Donald Trump's administration for its \"efforts and proposals to achieve peace,\" in a speech broadcast on national television.But he added that preparations for the Sudanese people's battle against the RSF were ongoing. \"Our preparations for war are a legitimate national right,\" he said.Sudan's chargé d'affaires in Nairobi, Mohamed Osman Akasha, told the BBC on Wednesday that the military-led government would agree to stop the fighting only if the RSF was dismantled, surrendered its weapons, and its leader was held accountable.\"I have no information about a proposal for truce. The only thing that I know is the government of Sudan, the people of Sudan are very determined to defeat this militia,\" he said.The RSF's truce announcement comes after an aid organisation warned that a network of community kitchens in Sudan was on the verge of collapse.The locally run kitchens have operated in areas that are difficult for international humanitarian groups to access, but are facing closure due to neglect, shortages and volunteer exhaustion.A report from Islamic Relief quoted one volunteer as saying most of these kitchens - which are crucial lifelines for millions caught up in the civil war - will close within six months.The conflict has created what the UN has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with estimates that more than 24 million people are facing acute food shortages in Sudan.ReutersMany of those who fled the siege of el-Fasher are living in camps in TawilaMore than 60,000 people have fled el-Fasher, which was captured by the RSF at the end of last month, the UN refugee agency said.There were reports of systematic killings as the group's fighters took control of the city.Survivors who escaped the siege told the BBC they had encountered \"unimaginable\" suffering and witnessed fighters torturing men trying to flee.\"We saw people murdered in front of us. We saw people being beaten. It was really terrible,\" Ezzeldin Hassan Musa said.Last week, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo announced an investigation into what he called \"violations\" committed by his soldiers in el-Fasher.The group has since released footage which it says shows the arrest of a fighter accused of carrying out executions.The UN's Human Rights Council said it would hold an urgent session on the situation in el-Fasher on 14 November.More on Sudan's civil war:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "7 hours agoTom BatemanState Department correspondentA former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) has told the BBC that US air strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats would be treated under international law as crimes against humanity.The comments by Luis Moreno Ocampo come as the Trump administration faces mounting questions over the legality of the attacks in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific - which have killed at least 66 people in the last two months.The administration says it is in a formal armed conflict with South American traffickers who are bringing drugs into the US.But Mr Moreno Ocampo said the military campaign fell into the category of a planned, systematic attack against civilians during peacetime.This, he said, meant that the campaign fell into the category of crimes against humanity.\"These are criminals, not soldiers. Criminals are civilians,\" said Mr Moreno Ocampo of the US allegations against the boat crews. \"They are criminals, and we should do better at investigating them, prosecuting them and controlling them, but not killing people,\" he told the BBC.The White House said in response that President Donald Trump acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect the US from cartels \"trying to bring poison to our shores... destroying American lives.\" It highlighted that the ICC had no jurisdiction over the United States and argued that it was a \"biased, unserious entity\".\"It's ridiculous that they are now lecturing President Trump and running cover for evil narcoterrorists trying to murder Americans,\" said White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly.Mr Moreno Ocampo, a lawyer from Argentina who helped lead the 1985 prosecution of that country's former military junta, described the strikes as a \"very dangerous\" expansion of the president's remit to use lethal force. In the past, he said, alleged drug boats would be stopped and suspects incarcerated.\"The US is alleging it can kill whoever they want, and that's a huge change because in the past the US, in particular after 1945, was the guarantor of global peace to protect Western values, basically,\" he said.\"That's… a very bad trend for the world,\" added Mr Moreno Ocampo, who served as the first chief prosecutor at the ICC from 2003 to 2012, opening investigations in seven different countries.The US is not a signatory to the Rome Statute which established the ICC and has recently sanctioned several of its judges in retaliation for the court's investigations related to the US and Israel.Mr Moreno Ocampo said: \"For me, it's very clear. A crime against humanity is a systematic attack against a civilian population, and there is no clarity why these people are not civilians, even [though] they could be criminals... and it's clearly systematic, because President Trump says they have planned and they organised this, so that should be the charge.\"The Trump administration has sought to justify the boat strikes by saying the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" whose actions \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\", according to a confidential note to Congress.In February, it designated eight Latin American organised crime groups as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs), naming Tren de Aragua in Venezuela, MS-13 in El Salvador and others. The move marked a significant extension in the use of FTO designations.On 2 September, Trump announced the first US airstrike on a vessel he said was a \"drug-carrying boat\" operated by Tren de Aragua with \"a lot of drugs\" onboard, killing 11 people. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called the attack a \"heinous crime\".Since then, at least 13 further strikes have taken place. No evidence has been made public for the claims of drugs onboard, nor which substances are allegedly involved. The BBC has repeatedly asked the Pentagon for names of the those targeted, but none have been given.Meanwhile, a major US military buildup has taken place in the region, leading to speculation about future land strikes, though Trump recently downplayed the possibility of any war unfolding. Maduro sees the action as an attempt to drive him from power. Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.An FTO designation - of the sort used by the Trump administration against the drugs traffickers - carries no inherent legal weight when it comes to the use of lethal military force, according to Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser at the US Department of State. He described the overall US legal position on the strikes as \"completely unconvincing\".\"You're left with a situation which involves premeditated killing outside of armed conflict, and we refer to that as murder,\" he said.Republicans in Congress have largely rallied around Trump's military action. On Wednesday, in a classified meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio briefed key lawmakers on the attacks. Afterwards, James Risch, a Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, said he was \"fully satisfied\" they were lawful.\"The administration has kept me and other members fully advised… They've got good legal justification for what they're doing,\" he said.\"The president really ought to be congratulated for saving the lives of young American people,\" Risch added.But many opposition Democrats have challenged the legality of the strikes. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said after leaving the briefing: \"What we heard isn't enough. We need a lot more answers and I am now asking [the administration] for an all-senators briefing on this issue,\" he said.Under the US Constitution, the power to declare war rests with Congress. Many past presidents have ordered military action without congressional approval, but usually provide legal justifications as required by the 1973 War Powers Resolution which sets out limits on the president's powers.Following a classified briefing to members of the House Armed Services Committee last Thursday, Democratic Congresswoman Sara Jacobs said Pentagon officials had not provided a legal justification for what she called \"extrajudicial killings where we have no evidence\".She added that lawmakers were told the strikes had targeted the alleged trafficking of cocaine instead of fentanyl – though fentanyl is the substance linked to the majority of overdose related deaths from illicit drugs in the US.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMayeni JonesAfrica correspondent, JohannesburgSouth Africa has skated over the latest criticism from US President Donald Trump, who has said he does not think the country should be part of the G20 any longer.Presidential spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told the BBC his country was confident it would host a very successful G20 summit when leaders from the world's largest economies gather in Johannesburg later this month.Trump, who has repeatedly accused South Africa of discriminating against its white minority, will not be attending - sending Vice-President JD Vance instead.Every year, a different member state holds the presidency of the G20 and sets the agenda for the leaders' summit - with the US due to take over after South Africa.\"South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs any more, because what's happened there is bad. I'm not going to represent our country there. It shouldn't be there,\" Trump said at a conference in Miami on Wednesday.South Africa's government declined to make a full statement in response to these comments, though last week it hit back at the US's decision to prioritise refugee applications from white South African Afrikaners, who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers.It said claims of a white genocide had been widely discredited and lacked reliable evidence.South Africa's latest crime statistics do not indicate that more white people have fallen victim to violent crime than other racial groups.The G20 was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis. The nations involved have more than 85% of the world's wealth and its aim was to restore economic stability.The first leaders' summit was held in 2008 in response to that year's global financial turmoil, to promote international co-operation.Now the leaders get together each year - along with representatives of the European Union and African Union - to talk about the world's economies and the issues countries are facing.There is no formal procedure laid down for kicking a country out of the G20 as it is not a treaty-based organisation like the UN and does not have a legal charter or constitution. It is an informal forum that operates by consensus.\"If a country was going to be kicked out, it would basically mean that it was excluded from the meetings - it wasn't invited to the meetings by whoever was hosting the G20 that year,\" Dr Andrew Gawthorpe from UK-based think-tank the Foreign Policy Centre told the BBC.\"But the host country would be unlikely to take the decision to not invite another country unless there was agreement amongst the rest of the members to do that,\" he said. Chris Vandome, senior research fellow at Chatham House's Africa programme, agrees such a consensus would be unlikely - and historically the US's participation in the G20 had been regarded as disruptive.\"A number of the working groups and ministerial meetings have not led to declarations… because the Americans have been disrupting things,\" he told the BBC.In fact he noted that other countries had doubled down and seen the US's position as an opportunity.\"In particular the European Union, with large financial commitments made to South Africa and Africa,\" Mr Vandrome said.\"Also, on the Asian side, there's no way that I think that China would accept a sort of rejection of South Africa.\"The obvious historical precedent is Russia's expulsion from what was then the G8 - a grouping of the world's most advanced economies - after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Russia remains in the G20, which includes countries from around the world. There were calls for Russia to be expelled from the G20 after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but in a larger grouping of countries with their own alliances, consensus could not be reached.This year South Africa has adopted the theme of solidarity, equality and sustainability - something the country's foreign ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri emphasised following Trump's criticism.\"Drawing on our own journey from racial and ethnic division to democracy, South Africa is uniquely positioned to champion within the G20 a future of genuine solidarity, where shared prosperity bridges deep inequalities,\" Mr Phiri said in a statement to the BBC.\"And collective action for sustainability that centres the development to address the impact of colonialism of the African continent.\"Trump offered refugee status to Afrikaners earlier this year after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances.Most private farmland is owned by white South Africans, who make up just over 7% of the population.South Africa made efforts to soothe tensions, with Ramaphosa going to the White House in May with a large delegation that included white members of his coalition government and also famous white South African golfers.But Trump ambushed the Oval Office meeting with claims that white South African farmers were being killed and \"persecuted\" - producing unsubstantiated evidence that has been widely discredited.Further efforts by South Africa to mend the relationship failed, with Africa's largest economy being hit in August with 30% tariffs on goods being exported to the US - the highest rate in sub-Saharan Africa.Additional reporting by Stuart Hughes",

    "body": "4 hours agoLucy Clarke-Billings and Jonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesTrees came down in high winds near Quy Nhon beach in Gia Lai, central Vietnam, as Kalmaegi approached on ThursdayTyphoon Kalmaegi made landfall in Vietnam on Thursday after killing at least 114 people and flooding entire towns in the Philippines. More than 260,000 soldiers are on standby for rescue efforts as winds of up to 92mph (149km/h) hit the country's coastline, according to Vietnamese media and the government's online portal.Six airports in the country have been forced to close and hundreds of flights are expected to be affected, the government warned. The country, which has already been battling record rains and floods, is now facing one of Asia's strongest typhoons this year.The country's environment ministry said on Thursday that \"the storm is on land, in the provinces of Dak Lak and Gia Lai\" in a statement quoted by various outlets, including the AFP news agency.The Vietnamese national weather forecaster says hundreds of localities in seven cities and provinces are at risk of flooding and landslides in the next six hours. There have already been reports of damage from several provinces, including roofs torn off homes, shattered glass panels at hotels, and trees uprooted or snapped along city streets and rural roads by powerful gusts.In the Quy Non area, trees have fallen on main roads and windows in hotels have smashed.The typhoon made landfall in Vietnam at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT). About 30 minutes later, hundreds of residents in two communes of Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported.Many people reported that their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area.Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.The typhoon could generate waves of up to 8m (26ft) on the South China Sea, according to Vietnam's weather bureau. Vietnam's military has deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and pieces of equipment, including six aircraft, to help with storm relief efforts.On Wednesday morning, a reporter from AFP news agency saw officials knocking on the doors of homes in coastal communities and warning people to evacuate.According to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response.\"We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,\" he was quoted as saying.\"No one should be left hungry or cold.\" AFP via Getty ImagesThe clean up began on Thursday at a hotel near Quy Nhon beach after it took heavy damageBefore making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines.At least 114 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier.Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home in Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction.\"We don't have any home anymore,\" she said. \"We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. \"We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different.\"Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.EPAPeople took shelter in evacuation centres on Thursday after flooding destroyed homes in Cebu, Philippines the day beforeVietnam has already been battling with floods and record rains for the past week.Burst riverbanks have flooded some of the country's most popular tourist spots, including the Unesco-listed city of Hue and historic hotspot Hoi An, where residents have been pictured navigating the city in wooden boats after the Hoai river overflowed.Seaside communities in Vietnam are expected to be hit hard by Typhoon Kalmaegi. A sea-level rise of 4 to 6m (13 to 20ft) in at least two provinces could capsize boats and devastate fishing farms, according to a forecast issued at 16:00 local time (9:00 GMT) by a senior official at Vietnam's National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.Meanwhile, deputy director Nguyen Xuan Hien says Typhoon Damrey - which struck Vietnam in 2017 with less intensity than Kalmaegi, but still caused severe damage to coastal communities - should serve as a warning and urged people to remain highly alert.Thailand is also bracing for the storm's impact. Local officials have warned of flash floods, landslides and river overflows.EPAWaves crashed on the beach in Cua Dai, Da Nang, central Vietnam, on Thursday",

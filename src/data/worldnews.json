    "body": "An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains has killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, according to rescuers. The mountaineers, travelling in separate groups, were scaling Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps at around 16:00 local time on Saturday when the fast-moving snow hit.  A group of three people \"was fully swept away by the avalanche\" and all died, said Italy's Alpine rescue service, Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico.Separately, the father and daughter were carried away by the avalanche and their bodies were recovered on Sunday. Two other climbers in a third party survived.The alarm was raised by the survivors, triggering the rescue operation.Olaf Reinstadler, a spokesperson for the Sulden Mountain Rescue Service, told German media that the avalanche on the 3,545-metre (11,630ft) mountain, also called Vertainspitze, could have been caused by recent snow drifts which had not bonded to the ice below.He said climbing tours were popular and the weather conditions were good, but wondered why the mountaineers were climbing late in the afternoon, as the descent would have then taken until nightfall.The bodies of the three people climbing together were recovered on Saturday before rescue efforts were suspended due to fading light and safety conditions. The Alpine rescue service said that due to fog and low visibility, helicopters could not take off at first light on Sunday.However, once conditions improved, rescuers and avalanche dog units were airlifted to 2,600 metres before setting out on foot.By late morning, the bodies of the two missing mountaineers - the father and daughter - were found.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoKoh Ewe and Mahfouz Zubaide,BBC ProducerAt least eight people have died after an earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, say local authorities, with the toll expected to rise as rescue efforts continue. Some 180 people have also been left injured, Samin Joyenda, a health department spokesman of a nearby province told the BBC. The earthquake struck Mazar-e-Sharif, which is home to around 500,000 people, in the early hours of Monday, at around 01:00 local time (20:30 GMT).It had a magnitude of 6.3 and a depth of 28km (17mi, according to the US Geological Survey, and was marked at an orange alert level, which indicates \"significant casualties\" are likely. Haji Zaid, a Taliban spokesman in Balkh province - of which Mazar-e Sharif is the capital - wrote earlier on X that \"many people are injured\" in the Sholgara district, just south of Mazar-e- Sharif. He said they had received \"reports of minor injuries and superficial damages from all districts of the province\". \"Most of the injuries were caused by people falling from tall buildings,\" he wrote.Mazar-e Sharif is home to more than 500,000 people. Many of the city's residents rushed to the streets when the quake struck, as they feared their houses would collapse, AFP reported.The Taliban spokesman in Balkh also posted a video on X appearing to show debris strewn across the ground at the Blue Mosque, a local landmark in Mazar-e-Sharif.The religious complex is believed to house the tomb of the first Shia Imam - a religious leader believed to hold divine knowledge. It's now a site where pilgrims gather to pray and celebrate religious events.Khalid Zadran, a Taliban spokesman for the police in Kabul, wrote on X that police teams were \"closely monitoring the situation\". Numerous fatalities were also reported in Samangan, a mountainous province near Mazar-e-Sharif, according to its spokesman. The quake on Monday comes after a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan's mountainous eastern region in late August, killing more than 1,000 people.That earthquake was especially deadly as the rural houses in the region were typically made of mud and timber. Residents were trapped when their houses collapsed during the quake.Afghanistan is very prone to earthquakes because of its location on top of a number of fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has played down the possibility of a US war with Venezuela, but suggested Nicolás Maduro's days as the country's president are numbered.Asked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly.\"His comments come as the US continues to launch strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean. The Trump administration says the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US.Trump rejected suggestions that the US action was not about stopping narcotics, but aimed at ousting Maduro, a long-time Trump opponent, saying it was about \"many things\". At least 64 people have been killed by US strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, CBS News - the BBC's US News partner - reported. Speaking from Mar-a-Lago, Florida, Trump said: \"Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\"Maduro has previously accused Washington of \"fabricating a new war\", while Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said the strikes on boats are being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Trump said the government was \"not going to allow\" people \"from all over the world\" to come in. \"They come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular - has been bad. They have gangs,\" he said, singling out the Tren de Aragua gang. He called it \"the most vicious gang anywhere in the world\".It was Trump's first interview with CBS since he sued its parent company, Paramount, over a 2024 interview with then Vice-President Kamala Harris.He claimed the interview had been edited to \"tip the scales in favour of the Democratic party\".Paramount agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle the suit, but with the money allocated to Trump's future presidential library, not paid to him \"directly or indirectly\". It said the settlement did not include a statement of apology.Trump last appeared on the 60 Minutes programme in 2020, when he walked out of an interview with Lesley Stahl because he claimed the questions were biased. He did not agree to an interview with the show during the 2024 election.",

    "body": "Hamas has handed over three coffins it says contain the bodies of deceased Gaza hostages, according to the Israeli military.Israel has received the coffins, via the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip, and transported them to Israel for formal identification.If confirmed as deceased hostages, it would mean eight Israeli and foreign deceased  hostages remain in Gaza.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Israel that started last month, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding.Israel has accused Hamas of being too slow to return the deceased hostages, while Hamas has said it is working to recover bodies trapped under rubble in the territory.Hamas's armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said the remains had been found earlier on Sunday \"along the route of one of the tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip\".Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official X account said: \"All of the hostages' families have been updated accordingly, and our hearts are with them in this difficult hour. The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned.\"The Hostages and Missing Families Forum is pressing Netanyahu to act urgently to recover all remaining deceased hostages from Gaza.\"The Hostage Families demand that the prime minister act with determination and firmness in order... to return all of the deceased hostages to Israel's hands,\" the campaign group said in a statement.Hamas and Israel have accused each other of violating the ceasefire.On Sunday, an Israeli air strike killed a man in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military said it had struck a militant that was posing a threat to its soldiers. Under the first phase of the ceasefire, all the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 225 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 15 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Prior to Sunday, nine of the 11 dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis, one was Tanzanian, and one was Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,500 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "The Netherlands has said it will return a stolen 3,500-year-old sculpture to Egypt.It is \"highly likely\" the stone head, dating from the time of the pharaohs, was plundered during the Arab Spring in either 2011 or 2012, according to the Dutch  Information & Heritage Inspectorate.A decade later, it turned up at an arts and antiques fair in Maastricht and, following an anonymous tip-off, Dutch authorities determined it had been stolen and exported illegally. Dutch outgoing prime minister Dick Schoof made the pledge to hand it back as he attended the opening of the archaeological Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza this weekend.The Dutch government said the sculpture of a high-ranking official from the dynasty of Pharaoh Thutmose III is \"deeply meaningful to Egypt's identity\".The statue had been offered up for sale at The European Fine Art Foundation fair in 2022. The dealer voluntarily relinquished the sculpture after authorities had been tipped off about its illegal origin. The government said it expected to hand the stone head over to the Egyptian ambassador to the Netherlands at the end of this year.\"The Netherlands is committed both nationally and internationally to ensuring the return of heritage to its original owners,\" it said.The news comes as Egypt celebrated the opening of the enormous Grand Egyptian Museum showcasing its archaeological heritage this weekend.First proposed in 1992, the construction of the museum itself was interrupted by the Arab Spring.Costing around $1.2bn (£910m), the facility contains 100,000 artefacts, including the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun and his famous gold mask.Prominent Egyptologists are hoping the museum will strengthen demands for key antiquities held in other countries to be returned.These include the Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering hieroglyphics, which is on display at the British Museum in London.",

    "body": "US airports have been hit with widespread delays because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay during the federal government shutdown.A ground stop was issued at Newark Airport on Sunday morning, a major hub servicing New York. Average delays at Newark are more than three hours and could last until Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration says.Half of the 30 major airports in the US have staff shortages, and Transport Secretary Sean Duffy said flights will be cancelled across national airspace \"to make sure people are safe\".Nearly 13,000 air traffic controllers are working without pay as the government shutdown enters its second month.Air traffic controllers, like other essential federal workers, are required to work without pay during the shutdown, including Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents.  The aviation agency called on lawmakers to end the shutdown so that workers \"receive the pay they've earned and travelers can avoid further disruptions and delays\". The FAA said the shortages means it has had to reduce the flow of air traffic \"to maintain safety\". \"This may result in delays or cancellations,\" it added.On Saturday, about 4,500 flights within the US were delayed and more than 500 were cancelled, according to FlightAware. In New York, the largest US city, about 80% of air traffic controllers were absent heading into the weekend, according to the FAA.Transportation Secretary Duffy on Sunday told ABC the aviation agency would take any steps necessary to make sure travellers are safe.\"But there is a level of risk that gets injected into the system when we have a controller that's doing two jobs instead of one,\" he said.He added that air traffic controllers were under a great deal of stress and working without pay.\"They don't make a lot of money, and so they may be the only person that is bringing money into the household,\" he said.\"They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheque and not put food on the table? Or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables?\"Lawmakers are at an impasse as a Republican-led bill to fund the government has failed to pass the Senate over a dozen times.In exchange for re-opening the government, Democrats are seeking to extend tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans.They are also calling for a reverse to US President Donald Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people.",

    "body": "10 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterChina will begin easing an export ban on automotive computer chips vital to production of cars across the world as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China, the White House has said. The White House confirmed details of the deal in a new fact sheet after Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met in South Korea this week.The nations also reached agreements on US soybean exports, the supply of rare earth minerals, and the materials used in production of the drug fentanyl.  The deal de-escalates a trade war between the world's two largest economies after Trump hit China with tariffs after he entered office this year, leading to rounds of retaliatory tariffs and global business uncertainty.A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington told the BBC that details of the agreements reached had been shared by \"competent authorities\". \"China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial in nature,\" he said. \"As President Xi Jinping noted, the business relationship should continue to serve as the anchor and driving force for China-US relations, not a stumbling block or a point of friction.\"Speaking on Sunday following the release of the deal details, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN: \"We don't want to decouple from China… (But) they've shown themselves to be an unreliable partner.\"Much of what is in Saturday's fact sheet was announced by Trump and other officials following the meeting between the two leaders. Trump had described the talks, held in South Korea, as \"amazing\", while Beijing had said they had reached a consensus to resolve \"major trade issues\".One of the issues addressed in the deal was the export of automotive computer chips. There had been concern that a lack of chips from Nexperia, which has production facilities in China, could create global supply chain issues. Nexperia is a Chinese-owned company, but is based in the Netherlands. About 70% of Nexperia chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.The fact sheet states that China will \"take appropriate measures to ensure the resumption of trade from Nexperia's facilities in China, allowing production of critical legacy chips to flow to the rest of the world\".It follows Beijing saying on Saturday that it was considering exempting some firms from the ban. Last month, the likes of Volvo Cars and Volkswagen warned a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover said the lack of chips posed a threat to their business. On other key issues, Beijing will now pause export controls it brought in last month on rare earth minerals - vital in the production of cars, planes and weapons - for a year. The White House also said it would lower tariffs brought in to curb the import of fentanyl into the US, with China agreeing to take \"significant measures\" to deal with the issue. Fentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals, and while it is approved for medical use in the US, the powerful and highly-addictive substance has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.The chemicals used in its manufacturing, some of which have legitimate uses, are mostly sourced from China. On soybeans, China has committed to buying 12 million tonnes of US soybeans in the last two months of 2025, and 25 million metric tonnes in each of the following three years - which is roughly the level they were previously at. China's decision to stop purchasing soybeans from the US earlier this year denied American farmers access to their largest export market. In response, Trump revived a bailout for farmers which was in place during his first term in office.",

The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said in a statement that the online description and categorisation of the dolls \"makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content\", French media reported.Shein told the BBC: \"The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues.\" It said its team was \"investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures\".Shein is also \"conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors\".The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.The decision to allow Shein to open at BHV Marais, a shop in France's capital city that traces its roots back to 1856, has provoked controversy. The company has faced criticism for its labour practices and environmental record.Shein will open at BHV on Wednesday ahead of other shops across France, all owned by property firm Société des Grands Magasins.Commenting on the dolls sold on Shein's site, France's consumer watchdog warned that \"the dissemination, via an electronic communications network, of child pornography is punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine of €100,000 (£88,000)\".Shein said it \"maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any content or products that violate our platform policies or applicable laws\".A spokesperson said the fast fashion firm is taking the matter \"extremely seriously\".\"We are taking immediate corrective actions and reinforcing our internal controls to prevent this from happening again,\" they said. Shein has already been fined millions of euros in recent months.In September, France's data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de L'informatique et des Libertés, imposed a €150m (£132m) penalty on Shein for failing to get users' consent to allow \"cookies\" which collect information about people visiting a website.  Shein is contesting the fine, which it called \"wholly disproportionate\" and \"politically motivated\".",

    "body": "1 day agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, in KyivUkraine's top military commander has admitted his soldiers are facing \"difficult conditions\" defending Pokrovsk - a key eastern front-line town - against massed Russian forces.Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops were fending off a \"multi-thousand enemy\" force - but denied Russian claims that they were surrounded or blocked.He confirmed that elite special forces had been deployed to protect key supply lines which, army sources said, were all under Russian fire.The defence ministry in Moscow reported that Ukrainian troops were surrendering and 11 of their special forces had been killed after landing by helicopter - something denied by Kyiv.Gen Syrskyi said in a social media post on Saturday that he was \"back on the front\" to personally hear the latest reports from military commanders on the ground in the eastern Donetsk region.In a short video, Syrskyi is seen studying battlefield maps with other commanders, including the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov.It is unclear when or where the footage was recorded.Ukrainian media earlier reported that Budanov was in the region to personally oversee the operation by the special forces.The deployment of special forces suggests officials in Kyiv are determined to try to hold on to the town, which Russia has been trying to seize for more than a year.Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Saturday that Ukrainian troops \"have improved [their] tactical position\" in Pokrovsk - but the situation remained \"difficult and dynamic\".Late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that the defence of Pokrovsk was a \"priority\".There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town to the west of the Russian-seized regional capital of Donetsk. Images shared with news agencies late on Friday appear to show a Ukrainian Black Hawk helicopter deploying about 10 troops near Pokrovsk, although the location and date of the footage could not be verified.Russia's defence ministry said it had thwarted the deployment of Ukrainian military intelligence special forces north-west of the town, killing all 11 troops who landed by helicopter.DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source monitoring group, estimates about half of Pokrovsk is a so-called \"grey zone\" where neither side is in full control.A military source in Donetsk told the BBC that Ukrainian forces were not surrounded but their supply lines were under fire from Russian troops.The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had \"marginally advanced\" during recent counter-attacks north of Pokrovsk, but that the town was \"mainly a contested 'grey zone'\".Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014.Moscow wants Kyiv to cede the Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk regions - collectively known as the Donbas - as part of a peace deal, including the parts it currently does not control.Pokrovsk is a key transport and supply hub whose capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.But Kyiv also believes its capture would help Russia in its efforts to persuade the US that its military campaign is succeeding - and, therefore, that the West should acquiesce to its demands.Washington has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin's failure to move forward with peace negotiations - culminating in US President Donald Trump placing sanctions on two largest Russian oil producers and axing plans for a summit with President Vladimir Putin.Zelensky has publicly agreed with Trump's proposal for a ceasefire that would freeze the war along the current front lines. Putin is refusing to do so, insisting on his maximalist pre-invasion demands that Kyiv and its Western allies see as a de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Additional reporting by Jaroslav Lukiv",

    "body": "The number of people killed in Jamaica as a result of Hurricane Melissa has risen to 28, the Caribbean nation's prime minister has announced.Andrew Holness confirmed nine other deaths on Saturday, adding that there were reports of possible fatalities still being verified - suggesting the figure may yet rise.Emergency responders and aid agencies have struggled to reach certain parts of the island in the aftermath of the storm due to blocked roads, debris and flooding.The category five hurricane - the strongest type - has caused dozens of deaths across the Caribbean, bringing powerful winds and landslides to Cuba and Haiti.The full scale of the destruction Melissa wrought on Jamaica has only become clear in the past few days as the hurricane knocked out communication systems and power to much of the island after it made landfall on Tuesday.Communities on the island's western portion, such as Black River and Montego Bay, have seen the worst of the destruction.Images have emerged showing buildings razed to the ground, debris and belongings strewn on streets, and whole neighbourhoods still under floodwater.The Red Cross says that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.Jamaican officials confirmed to news agency AFP that multiple field hospitals were being established to treat people in the worst-affected areas in the west.Aid reaching those in need was initially held up by the temporary closure of Jamaica's airports. Now that it is arriving in the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating its distribution.With so many in need of clean drinking water, food and medicine, there have been reports of desperate people entering supermarkets and pharmacies to gather what they can.Melissa has become the most powerful storm on record to hit Jamaica, and one of the strongest seen in the Caribbean.At its peak, the hurricane had sustained winds of 185mph (295 km/h). A category five hurricane - those capable of catastrophic damage - has winds in excess of 157mph.At least 31 people have been killed in Haiti as a result of Melissa, while at least two deaths have been reported in the Dominican Republic.In Cuba, thousands of people have been evacuated as more than 60,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.Ahead of the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted above-normal activity.",

    "body": "Three men have been killed in a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said. It is the latest in a series of attacks on vessels the Trump administration says are being used to smuggle drugs into the US.Since they began in September, experts have questioned the legality of the strikes under international law, which have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted.Combatting the flow of illegal drugs is a key policy for US President Donald Trump - but some have suggested the strikes are part of efforts to influence politically opposed governments in the region.Hegseth said the boat targeted on Saturday was operated by a designated terrorist organisation - without specifying which one - and had been travelling in international waters when it was hit.The vessel was travelling along a known drug-smuggling route and carrying narcotics, he said, without providing evidence.Hegseth's statement late on Saturday was accompanied by a video that appears to show a blurred-out boat travelling through the water before exploding.Announcements of these strikes are usually accompanied with grainy footage but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking and few details about who or what was on board each vessel.The Trump administration has previously said that some boats targeted had departed from Venezuela.The Trump administration has insisted that it was targeting \"narco-terrorists\".The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported that at least 64 people have been killed by American airstrikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has previously described the attacks as \"murder\" and said they were being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Meanwhile, Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro accused Washington of \"fabricating a war\".The two left-wing leaders have increasingly been at odds with the Trump administration. Following Petro's comments, the US placed sanctions on him and his inner circle, as well as removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs. Trump has threatened military action against land targets in Venezuela.But this, he has admitted, may require the consent of the US Congress.However, some US lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, have said the strikes on vessels also required congressional approval - something Trump has denied. Others have questioned whether the lethal strikes were legal at all.The UN's human rights chief Volker Turk said on Friday that such attacks were a violation of international human rights law. \"Over 60 people have reportedly been killed in a continuing series of attacks carried out by US armed forces... in circumstances that find no justification in international law,\" he said. \"These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable.\"Experts in Latin American politics have suggested the strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific were part of a suite of measures designed to influence change in Colombia and Venezuela.The US is among many nations that consider Maduro's election last year as illegitimate, while Trump has been critical of Petro's policies on combatting the drug trade in his country, which has traditionally been a US ally.Washington has steadily been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean over the past few months, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking but which military analysts say is much larger than what is needed.",

    "body": "8 hours agoFrank Gardnersecurity correspondent, in BahrainNato \"will stand with Ukraine up to the day in which we will have them sitting around the table for a long-lasting peace\", a senior official from the military alliance has told the BBC.Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of Nato's military committee since January, added from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was bogged down, and \"it was almost time to sit and talk because it's a waste of lives\".Pointing to the fact that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had resulted in two more countries joining the Western alliance - Finland and Sweden - Adm Dragone described the war as a strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent slow, incremental advances by Russia on the battlefield. \"They will not get a friendly or puppet government like in Belarus. Putin will not succeed.\"Asked if European nations were prepared to keep going with supporting Ukraine's defence, he said they were. It was beneficial, he believed that they had had something of a wake-up call and were now taking charge of their own defence.In June, Nato members agreed to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. The move followed repeated urges from US President Donald Trump for members to do so.On Russia's recent announcement about long-range, nuclear-powered weapons like the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, the former Italian chief of defence staff and naval aviator played down concerns by Nato, saying that it was a defensive nuclear alliance. \"We are not threatened by them,\" he said, \"we are just ready to defend our 32 nations and our one billion people. We are a nuclear alliance.\"On the risk of future invasions or attacks, Adm Dragone said if - and he emphasised the conditional here - there was to be anywhere it would likely be the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But he pointed out that as Nato states Article 5 would be requested - which considers an attack on one nation to be equivalent to an attack on all - and that Nato would come to their defence. Asked if that included the US, he replied: \"Yes, because they have committed to this and they have underlined that they are still in the business.\"Of all Nato defence needs right now, Adm Dragone said air defence was the top priority. Recent incursions by Russian drones into Poland and Romania have prompted the alliance to upgrade its air defences. Regarding the possibility of activating a notional \"drone wall\" on Nato's eastern borders, he said this would be done within months and that \"the alliance's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk [Virginia] is already working on that\".\"There is a lot of stuff on the market which will fulfil our immediate needs so we set up a new activity which is Eastern Sentry... integrating all the air defence that we already have on our eastern flank. \"Airspace incursions are pretty frequent, we escort them out and that's basically the game,\" the admiral said.Despite no sign that Russia is changing course on the war in Ukraine and despite signs that some members - notably Slovakia and Hungary - are increasingly opposed to supporting Ukraine's defence, Adm Dragone ended on a positive note. \"The alliance is reliable, it is mature, there is a cohesion which is our centre of gravity.\"\"The alliance is stronger than our adversaries, and we will stay with Ukraine up to the day that peace will break out,\" he added.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersLast month's jewellery heist at the Louvre museum was carried out by petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals, Paris's prosecutor has said.\"This is not quite everyday delinquency... but it is a type of delinquency that we do not generally associate with the upper echelons of organised crime,\" Laure Beccuau told franceinfo radio.She said four people arrested and charged so far over the theft that shocked France and the world were \"clearly local people\" living in Seine-Saint-Denis, an impoverished area just north of Paris. Jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the most-visited museum, in the French capital, on 19 October.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenIn Sunday's interview to franceinfo radio, Beccuau said the four arrested people - three men and a woman - \"all live more or less in Seine-Saint-Denis\".She said two of the male suspects had been known to the police, as they each had multiple theft convictions.On Saturday, a 38-year-old woman was charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.Separately, a man, aged 37, was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy.The suspects - who have not been publicly named - both denied any involvement.Beccuau said the two were in a relationship and had children together, without giving any further details.Two men who had previously been arrested were already charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.Investigators believe four men carried out the daylight theft, and one of them is still on the run.Three other people detained earlier this week have been released without charge.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the suspects arrived at 09:30 local time (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Ms Beccuau told reporters last week.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.",

    "body": "Trump tells military to prepare for 'action' against Islamist militants in Nigeria11 hours agoJoseph WinterGetty ImagesDonald Trump says he would also cut all aid to NigeriaUS President Donald Trump has ordered the military to prepare for action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups, accusing the government of failing to protect Christians.Trump did not say which killings he was referring to, but claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians have been circulating in recent weeks and months in some right-wing US circles.Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.An advisor to Nigeria's president told the BBC that any military action against the jihadist groups should be carried out together.Daniel Bwala said Nigeria would welcome US help in tackling the Islamist insurgents but noted that it was a \"sovereign\" country.He also said the jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has insisted there is religious tolerance in the country and said the security challenges were affecting people \"across faiths and regions\".Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that he had instructed the US Department of War to prepare for \"possible action\".He warned that he might send the military into Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" unless the Nigerian government intervened, and said that all aid to what he called \"the now disgraced country\" would be cut.Trump added: \"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth replied to the post by writing: \"Yes sir.\"The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"Trump's threat has triggered alarm across Nigeria. Many on social media are urging the government to step up its fight against Islamist groups to avert a situation where foreign troops are sent into the country.But Mr Bwala, who said he was a Christian pastor, told the BBC's Newshour programme that Trump had a \"unique way of communicating\" and that Nigeria was not taking his words literally.\"We know the heart and intent of Trump is to help us fight insecurity,\" he said, adding that he hoped Trump would meet Tinubu in the coming days to discuss the issue.Trump earlier announced that he had declared Nigeria a \"Country of Particular Concern\" because of the \"existential threat\" posed to its Christian population. He said \"thousands\" had been killed, without providing any evidence.This is a designation used by the US State Department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".Following this announcement, Tinubu said his government was committed to working with the US and the international community to protect communities of all faiths.\"The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,\" the Nigerian leader said in a statement.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people - however most of these have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group which analyses political violence around the world.In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture. Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed, but atrocities have been committed on both sides and human rights group say there is no evidence that Christians have been disproportionately targeted.Trump has frequently expressed satisfaction over not having embroiled the US in a war during his tenure, and has cast himself as a peace-making president.But the Republican leader is facing a growing number of voices domestically, particularly from the political right, who have drawn attention to the situation in Nigeria.Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor in AbujaMore about Nigeria from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "12 hours agoBrandon Drenonin Westmoreland, JamaicaWatch: Hurricane Melissa - aerial view of 'ground zero' destructionFive days after Hurricane Melissa pummelled into western Jamaica with record force, residents in devastated communities along the coast are still desperately waiting for help.Many of the roads are blocked by debris and people are isolated with little food, no power or running water, and no idea of when normalcy will return.The government said on Saturday that at least 28 people in Jamaica have died since the hurricane hit as a monster category five storm with 185 mph (297km/h) sustained winds.That is a near 50% jump in the death toll overnight, and the number could rise as officials clear their way into new parts of the island in the coming days.Local official Dr Dayton Campbell told the BBC 10 of those deaths were in Westmoreland.Westmoreland parish is believed to have the second highest number of unconfirmed deaths, after St Elizabeth to the south east. The eye of the storm hit somewhere between the two neighbouring parishes. At St Elizabeth an estimated 90% of homes have been destroyed.Hurricane death toll rises as Jamaica aid effort strugglesBrandon Drenon / BBC NewsA town just outside of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish sits in ruinsA long stretch of road headed west into Westmoreland Parish winds through a graveyard of trees – stacks of branches and limbs, cracked and twisted, blanketing the landscape for miles. It is grim evidence of Hurricane Melissa's ferocity - it was the strongest storm to strike the Caribbean island in modern history.Piles of debris are heaped on the parish's roadsides, next to battered buildings, shipping crates turned on their side and crowds of people wading through the destruction.On Saturday morning, men with machetes hacked through branches as thick as their arms, clearing patches of the road where traffic jams were at a standstill.A policeman with an automatic weapon strapped to his chest, part of a convoy accompanying an aid truck on its way to Westmoreland, hopped out of his vehicle to help direct traffic.\"We don't know what lies ahead,\" the officer told the BBC, describing what he has seen as \"total devastation\".Brandon Drenon / BBCBrandon Drenon / BBCRoy Perry says he has lost everything in the wake of the strongest hurricane in Jamaican historyBrandon Drenon / BBCAnthony Burnett (left) and Gary Williams (right)Those living in Whitehouse, a coastal town and commercial hub on the edge of Westmoreland Parish, say the wait for assistance is becoming frustrating.Gary Williams said he has heard promises of incoming aid delivery, but \"they no turn up\".He sat in the shade on a makeshift stool in front of a building barely standing – its entire roof gone – unsure of what to do next.Williams said he lost his house in the storm and has \"nowhere to live\", suggesting he might sleep right where he is, outside on the front porch.Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Words can't explain the situation that we're in. It's horrible. I don't even know what to say. So many hopeless, helpless and lifeless people here right now.\"About 400,000 people in Jamaica were without power as of Friday, and an untold number more have no access to cell phone service or Wi-Fi, cut off from the outside world.Jamaica's transportation minister Daryl Vaz announced on Saturday that more than 200 StarLink devices have been deployed across the island to help people access the internet.He addressed criticism the government has received for its response, saying there were \"several factors\" contributing to delays.\"Refuelling, Areas for Landing, Accessibility and Timing/Visibility,\" Vaz said on X.Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged that the \"immediate focus is on clearing debris, restoring essential services\", as well as providing food and medical supplies.But that would only solve part of the problem.Brandon Drenon / BBCResidents of Whitehouse in Westmoreland Parish try to piece their lives back togetherIn a tiny community just outside of Whitehouse, Robert Morris rested against a slab of broken concrete. Behind him, the fishing village he has called home his entire life has been destroyed, along with his livelihood.\"We all devastated here, man,\" he said. He said the boat house was destroyed and is now \"flat\".\"Melissa take everything down,\" he said, including his fishing boat, which he describes as \"mashed up\".Morris also told of \"no help, no food, no water\".\"We just have to try and see what we can do,\" he said, adding that his plan was to find someone whose boat was still intact so that he could join and fish.Even then, he is not sure where he would sell his catch.The people in these areas are filled with pride and resilience, words that are often repeated on local radio stations and visible through their optimism in the most difficult circumstances.Seated under the facade of a badly damaged building, Roy Perry said he has lost everything, but \"we have to just keep the faith and the hope is up still\".Brandon Drenon / BBCRobert Morris fishing village in view over his right shoulder has been entirely destroyedBrandon Drenon / BBCOreth Jones, a local farmer, said his farm was \"all wrecked\" \"Can't give up. Not gonna give up,\" he said.It is the same tone struck by Oreth Jones, a farmer sitting in the bed of his truck selling pears, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes – the last of his produce that was spared from the storm.Of his farm, he said: \"It's all wrecked. They all destroyed.\" But he quickly followed up with: \"We have to give God thanks we're alive.\"Jones survived the strongest hurricane in Jamaican history while he was injured, wearing a homemade splint on his right leg from a fracture he suffered during a biking accident before Melissa hit.When asked about how the community will move forward, he said: \"Pray. Nothing else we can do. Nothing else.\"Meanwhile, foreign aid has now started entering into Jamaica. The US State Department announced on Friday that its Disaster Assistance Response Team had arrived. And countries including the UK have also pledged millions in aid relief funds and emergency supplies.",

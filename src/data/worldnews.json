    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge3 days agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"Back in Columbia University, all those years ago, the student from Pakistan had asked me a question. \"Don't you find it interesting,\" he said, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based international order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesA former French senator has been found guilty of spiking an MP's drink with ecstasy in order to sexually assault her.Joel Guerriau received a four-year prison sentence - 18 months of which are to be served behind bars - and, according to local media, was ordered to pay Sandrine Josso €5,000 (£4,348) in damages for emotional distress. Guerriau, now 68, had invited Josso, 50, to his Paris flat in November 2023. He later admitted serving her a drink spiked with MDMA, but maintained it was an accident and denied having any intention of assaulting her.Shortly after the verdict on Tuesday, Josso said it was a \"huge relief\", AFP reports. Meanwhile, Guerriau's lawyers said he would appeal.According to court documents quoted by French media, Josso said she had gone to Guerrieau's home three years ago to celebrate his re-election when she started feeling unwell after drinking from a champagne glass.\"I had gone to visit a friend and I discovered an aggressor,\" she said on Monday while giving evidence in the trial. \"He looked at me insistently, I'd never seen him that way. I didn't want to show him my weakness, because I was worried that if I told him I wasn't feeling well, he would've forced me to lie down.\"Josso recalled managing to leave the flat and, with the help of a colleague, went to hospital where a toxicology report confirmed her blood had three times the recreational dose of MDMA.Guerriau told the court he had been going through a period of depression, and had meant to take the drug himself the night before. He did not end up doing so and accidentally offered the glass containing MDMA to Josso the following evening, he said.\"I feel sorry for Sandrine,\" Guerriau told the court in Paris. \"I am disgusted with myself, with my recklessness and my stupidity.\"He added: \"We don't talk about the effects of these drugs enough... All I want is to speak out on the dangers of these products.\"Getty ImagesSandrine Josso remains an MP for the centre-right MoDem partyAsked about the several internet searches he made around ecstasy and the drug GHB, he said he had no recollection.\"I was on the train, thoughts and ideas just come to you,\" he told the court, adding government members needed to show an interest in \"all current events\".Guerriau, a centre-right senator from the Horizons party, was suspended when the charges against him came to light. He resigned as a senator last October.Josso, who is still an MP for the centre-right MoDem, has become a staunch campaigner against so-called chemical submission - drug-facilitated sexual assault.\"What I went through is still very painful,\" Josso said, speaking to French media ahead of the trial beginning. \"Psychological trauma feels like being frozen in time... I jump at the slightest thing. I've become very vulnerable.\"Josso has gone on to join an association against chemical submission, set up by Caroline Darian - the daughter of Dominique Pelicot, who in 2024 was found guilty of drugging his wife Gisele and inviting men to rape her in their home for over a decade.Josso was often in court during the Pelicot trial. This week, Darian and her brother David attended the proceedings in the Guerriau case.",

    "body": "A Tokyo court has asked Pyongyang to pay 88 million Japanese yen ($570,000; £416,000) to four people who were lured to North Korea decades ago by a propaganda scheme.The plaintiffs said the North was marketed to them as \"paradise on Earth\", but they instead found themselves subject to harsh conditions, including forced labour. They later escaped. Monday's ruling is largely symbolic with no real way to enforce it: North Korea has for years ignored the lawsuit, and its leader Kim Jong Un has not responded to Japanese court summons.But the ruling, which comes after a years-long legal battle in Japanese courts, has been hailed by the plaintiffs' lawyer as \"historic\".This was the first time \"a Japanese court exercised its sovereignty against North Korea to recognise its malpractice\", said Atsushi Shiraki, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, AFP reported.More than 90,000 Zainichi Koreans - ethnic Koreans who live in Japan - moved to North Korea between 1959 and 1984, under a resettlement scheme which promised an idyllic life of free healthcare, education and jobs. But instead survivors say they found themselves forced to work on farms and factories, subject to restrictions and could not leave.One of the plaintiffs, Eiko Kawasaki, went to North Korea in 1960, when she was 17. She escaped in 2003 and is now 83 years old.She was among a group of five plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit in 2018 demanding compensation. Two of the original plaintiffs have since died, but one of them continued to be represented in the lawsuit by their family.In 2022, a Tokyo district court rejected their compensation claims, saying that it fell outside Japanese jurisdiction and the statute of limitations had expired.But in 2023, the Tokyo High Court ruled that the case was in fact under Japanese jurisdiction and found that North Korea had violated the plaintiffs' rights.\"It's not an overstatement to say most of their lives were ruined by North Korea,\" judge Taiichi Kamino said at a ruling at the Tokyo District Court on Monday,  according to an Associated Press report. Kenji Fukuda, another lawyer for the plaintiffs acknowledged the significance of the ruling but said it would be a \"challenge\" actually getting any money from North Korea. ",

    "body": "10 hours agoAyeshea PereraAsia digital editorReutersFire officials warn that the situation is changing rapidlyFirefighters in the Australian state of Victoria are battling at least six major fires as a record-breaking heatwave hits the country's south-east. Two fires are currently burning at \"emergency level\" according to local broadcaster ABC News. Several communities have been issued emergency warnings to either evacuate, watch and wait, or shelter in place. Fire officials warn that the situation is changing rapidly and have asked locals to stay up to date with the latest warnings.The Bureau of Meteorology says that parts of the state have seen all-time temperature highs - with one area hitting a high of 48.9C. Melbourne has recorded a temperature of 41C. Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria, had told reporters that the state's heat conditions were making conditions \"incredibly difficult\" for firefighters.Two fires - in Camperdown and Otways - are burning at emergency level. A new fire in the Larralea area is also causing \"significant concern\". Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer Jason Heffernan told ABC Radio that there was a danger that the Otways fire could produce ember showers \"which can create more fires in front of the main fire\". It is unclear what damage has been caused by the fires, but Australia's Deputy Incident Controller Alistair Drayton, said he had \"anecdotal evidence\" that some homes had been lost. He also praised the \"spectacular\" work done by firefighters so far. Apart from Victoria, where there is a total fire ban, South Australia has also been placed under alert for \"extreme\" fire risk.Meanhwile health officials have warned that the prolonged heat carries significant health risks. The elderly, children and people with underlying health conditions are most at risk,  Victoria chief health officer Caroline McElnay told reporters.\"It can cause potentially fatal health problems such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke but it can also trigger events like heart attacks or stroke.\"Scientists are clear that human-caused climate change is making heatwaves much more likely and more intense globally.And Australasia has seen an increasing frequency and severity of heat extremes in recent decades, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).South-east Australia also experienced extreme heat in early January, with temperatures surpassing 40C. A rapid study by scientists at the World Weather Attribution group estimated that the high temperatures across a three-day period were now at least five times more likely as a result of climate change.While fires occur naturally in Australia, these hot, dry conditions can make it much easier for fires to spread, potentially fuelling larger blazes.And as the world continues to warm, Australia is expected to see further increases in these \"fire weather\" conditions, according to the IPCC.Additional reporting by Mark Poynting",

    "body": "A frowning horse plush has become a viral bestseller ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations for the year of the horse in China.The sad-looking soft toy was originally made in error after a worker sewed a smile on the horse upside down, the owner of Happy Sister - a shop in the eastern city of Yiwu - told Reuters news agency.Zhang Huoqing had expected to have to issue a refund to the customer who bought the toy, but after an image of it started circulating online the horse began selling out.Zhang said the animal's gloomy expression was resonating with young workers in China.\"A lot of customers like it, and they said it makes sense: that it suits the spirit of today's corporate slaves,\" Zhang said.\"This crying horse really fits the reality of modern working people,\" she added.\"People joked that the crying horse is how you look at work, while the smiling one is how you look after work.\"Zhang's factory has surged production to meet demand - including from other countries, according to media reports.One buyer, known online as Tuan Tuan Mami, was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying: \"This little horse looks so sad and pitiful, just like the way I feel at work.\"With this crying toy in the Year of the Horse, I hope to leave all my grievances at work behind and keep only happiness.\"The newspaper says the horse is about 20cm (7.8in) tall and costs 25 yuan (£2.62). It is red for good luck, with a golden collar and bell around its neck, and has the phrase \"money comes quickly\" embroidered on its body in golden letters.Another shop owner in Yiwu, Lou Zhenxian, told Reuters she thought the toy was ugly, but \"it's the kind of emotional value young people look for these days\".She described young people going to work in the kind of state like the crying horse, and when you get off work \"being immediately happy\".\"But actually if everyone chases that kind of sentiment, the young people's way of thinking, it's not quite right. I believe you should work hard when at work and be happy after work, it shouldn't be two extreme opposites,\" she said.Lunar New Year will be celebrated in February to usher in the year of the horse - one of 12 animals repeated in a cycle under the Chinese zodiac calendar.

    "body": "Nipah virus outbreak in India triggers Asia airport screenings8 hours agoKelly NgEPAThe Nipah virus can spread from animals to humans.An outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus in India's West Bengal state has sparked concern in parts of Asia, with some tightening screening measures at airports.Thailand has started screening passengers at three airports that receive flights from West Bengal. Nepal has also begun screening arrivals at Kathmandu airport and other land border points with India.Two cases have been confirmed in West Bengal since December, reportedly in healthcare workers. Some 196 people who were in contact with them have been traced and tested negative for the virus, India's health ministry says.The virus can spread from animals to humans. It has a high death range – ranging from 40% to 75% – as there is no vaccine or medicine to treat it.What is the Nipah virus and what are its symptoms?The Nipah virus can be transmitted from animals, like pigs and fruit bats, to humans. It can also  spread person-to-person through contaminated food.The World Health Organization has described Nipah in its top ten priority diseases, along with pathogens like Covid-19 and Zika, because of its potential to trigger an epidemic.The incubation period ranges from four to 14 days.People who contract the virus show a wide range of symptoms, or sometimes, none at all.Initial symptoms may include fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting and sore throat. In some people, these may be followed by drowsiness, altered consciousness, and pneumonia.Encephalitis, a sometimes-fatal condition that causes inflammation of the brain, may occur in severe cases.To date, no drugs of vaccines have been approved to treat the disease. Where were the past outbreaks?The first recognised Nipah outbreak was in 1998 among pig farmers in Malaysia and later spread to neighbouring Singapore. The virus got its name from the village where it was first discovered.More than 100 people were killed and a million pigs culled in an effort to contain the virus. It also resulted in significant economic losses for farmers and those in the livestock trade.Bangladesh has borne the brunt in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since 2001.The virus has also been detected in India. Outbreaks were reported in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007. More recently, the southern state of Kerala has been a Nipah hotspot. In 2018, 19 cases were reported of which 17 were fatal; and in 2023, two out of six confirmed cases later died.What is happening now?India's health ministry said that following confirmation of the cases in West Bengal, contacts of the infected individuals were \"identified, traced, monitored, and tested\" - and had been found to be asymptomatic.\"The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health measures are in place,\" the ministry said.No cases have yet been reported outside India, but several countries are stepping up precautions. On Sunday, Thailand started screening passengers at three international airports in Bangkok and Phuket that receive flights from West Bengal. Passengers from these flights have been asked to make health declarations.The parks and wildlife department has also implemented stricter screenings in natural tourist attractions.Jurai Wongswasdi, a spokeswoman for the Department for Disease Control, told BBC Thai authorities are \"fairly confident\" about guarding against an outbreak in Thailand. Nepal, too, has begun screening people arriving through the airport in Kathmandu and other land border points with India.Meanwhile, health authorities in Taiwan have proposed to list the Nipah virus as a \"Category 5 disease\". Under the island's system, diseases classified as Category 5 are emerging or rare infections with major public health risks, that require immediate reporting and special control measures.Correction: An earlier version of this story said that at least five people had been infected in West Bengal but India's health ministry later released a statement saying only two cases had been confirmed in the state since December.",

    "body": "8 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has told reporters he stands behind his speech in Davos calling out unconstrained super powers, after a Trump official said he had \"aggressively\" walked it back in a call with US President Donald Trump. \"To be absolutely clear, and I said this to the president, I meant what I said in Davos,\" Carney said on Tuesday, confirming he and Trump had spoken by phone.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told Fox News on Monday that Carney was \"very aggressively walking back\" some of the remarks to Trump.Carney made global headlines for his Davos speech, in which he indirectly called out the US president for a \"rupture\" in the postwar world order.Trump responded in his own Davos speech the following day by saying that \"Canada lives because of the United States\". Speaking to reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday, Carney denied Bessent's recollection of the phone call.He added that it was the US president who had called him on Monday, and that the two had a \"very good conversation on a wide range of subjects\", including Ukraine, Venezuela, Arctic security and Canada's recent trade agreement with China.Carney said the two also discussed the USMCA, a free-trade pact between Canada, the US and Mexico that is up for a mandatory review later this year.Carney said his speech in Davos clearly outlined how \"Canada was the first country to understand the change in US trade policy that (Trump) had initiated, and we're responding to that\".He added that the president understood Canada's position. In the Fox News interview on Monday, Bessent criticised Canada's decision to negotiate a trade deal with China. He added that he was \"not sure what the Prime Minister was thinking\" when he made his speech in Davos.\"Canada depends on the US,\" Bessent said. \"There's much more north-south trade then there could ever be east-west trade.\"\"The prime minister should do what's best for the Canadian people rather than try to push his globalist agenda,\" the treasury secretary added.His remarks came after Trump threatened Canada with 100% tariffs on its goods if it allows Chinese goods to flow freely to the US, skirting levies.The deal between Ottawa and Beijing would lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will tax a limited number of Chinese electric vehicles, or EVs, at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.Carney said that Canada is not pursuing a free-trade deal with China and has \"never\" considered it. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Carney added that he believed Trump's latest tariff threat is a negotiation tactic ahead of talks on USMCA.\"The president is a strong negotiator, and I think some of these comments and positioning should be viewed in the broader context of that,\" he said.",

    "body": "8 hours agoGuy HedgecoeMadrid correspondentThe Spanish government has announced a plan to legalise the status of undocumented migrants, a measure expected to benefit at least half a million people.Regularisation will be available to foreign nationals who do not have a criminal record and can prove they lived in Spain for at least five months prior to 31 December 2025.\"This is an historic day for our country,\" said Elma Saiz, Spain's minister of inclusion, social security and migration. The measure will provide beneficiaries with an initial one-year residence permit, which can then be extended. Requests for legalisation are expected to begin in April and the process will remain open until the end of June.\"We are reinforcing a migratory model based on human rights, integration, co-existence and which is compatible with economic growth and social cohesion,\" Saiz said.Spain has seen a large influx of migrants in recent years, mainly from Latin America.The conservative think-tank Funcas found that the number of undocumented migrants in Spain had risen from 107,409 in 2017 to 837,938 in 2025 - an eight-fold increase. The highest number of undocumented arrivals currently living in Spain are believed to be from Colombia, Peru and Honduras.Spain's socialist-led coalition government has been an outlier on this issue among the larger European nations, underlining the importance of migrants for the economy. The country has been outperforming the other main EU economies in recent years, posting expected growth of close to 3% in 2025.Unemployment, a longstanding weakness of the Spanish economy, has dipped below 10% for the first time since 2008, according to figures released on Tuesday.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has described immigrants as representing \"wealth, development and prosperity\" for Spain, pointing to their contribution to the social security system.The government and parties on the left have also emphasised the need to treat migrants in a humane way.\"Providing rights is the answer to racism,\" said Irene Montero, of the far-left Podemos party and a former minister in a coalition government with the Socialists.She has campaigned for this measure, which followed an agreement between the party and the government. A civic legislative proposal, calling for a mass migrant regularisation, received the support of around 700,000 people but had been languishing in parliament.This measure will be approved by royal decree, meaning it does not require parliamentary approval.It is the first large-scale migrant regularisation in Spain for two decades.Several such initiatives, by governments of both the Socialists and the conservative People's Party (PP), legalised the status of an estimated half a million migrants between 1986 and 2005.However, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the PP, said the latest mass legalisation would \"increase the pull effect and overwhelm our public services\".Pepa Millán, spokeswoman for the far-right Vox, said the initiative \"attacks our identity\", adding that the party would appeal before the Supreme Court in a bid to block it.",

    "body": "Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have ruled that former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte is fit to attend pre-trial proceedings for alleged crimes against humanity.The ICC also will hold a hearing on 23 February to decide whether the prosecution's case against Duterte is strong enough to proceed to a trial.Duterte's lawyers earlier argued that the 80-year-old was unfit to participate in the ICC proceedings citing \"cognitive impairment\". He has been detained at the Hague since March 2025.He is accused of being responsible for dozens of murders under his so-called war on drugs, during which thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial.Duterte was president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022. He justified his war on drugs by saying peace and order would pave the way for economic development.Citing opinions from a panel of medical experts, ICC judges said they were \"satisfied\" that Duterte is \"able effectively to exercise his procedural rights and is therefore fit to take part in the pre-trial proceedings\".ICC judges also said in their decision on Monday that the mental capacities needed to \"meaningfully exercise one's procedural and fair trial rights\" did not have to be \"at their notionally highest level\".\"This ruling tells victims that in the reckoning of Duterte at the ICC, their voices will not be sidelined by technical evasions,\" said Congresswoman Leila de Lima, one of Duterte's fiercest critics who was jailed during his presidency on drug charges that were later found to be false.Duterte was arrested at Manila airport in March 2025 as his family's alliance with his successor, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr crumbled.His arrest has divided Filipinos. While his deadly drugs crackdown has drawn sharp criticism from civil society, his populist message resonates with those who feel sidelined by Manila's political elite.In May last year, Duterte was elected mayor of Davao city despite being in prison. His daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte, is also widely expected to run for president in the 2028 elections, where Marcos is ineligible to seek a second term.",

    "body": "1 day agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

    "body": "Sweden is moving forward with plans to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 15 to 13 in serious cases as it grapples with a growing number of children recruited into gangs to carry out violent crimes without facing serious legal repercussions.Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said the country was in an \"emergency situation\" and stopping the use of children in criminal networks was a \"crucial task\" for the government.But several authorities, including police, prison officials and prosecutors, have opposed the plan, with some worried that it may lead to even younger children becoming offenders.If passed, the legislation will go into force as early as this summer.Strommer insisted that the proposal did not amount to a \"general lowering of the age of criminal responsibility\" and would only apply to the \"most serious crimes\" such as murder, attempted murder, aggravated bombings, aggravated weapons offences and aggravated rape.Under the proposal, some of these offenders could face prison sentences in certain cases.Data from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows that the number of registered offences linked to suspects under the age of 15 has doubled over the past decade.The current government came into power in 2022 vowing to crack down on organised crime.At the beginning of last year, a government-ordered inquiry recommended lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 14 in serious cases.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed in September that it would be lowered from 15, saying children are \"being ruthlessly exploited by criminal networks to commit serious crimes\".\"Both to protect these children and their potential victims, the government is taking strong action against this type of cynical exploitation,\" he added.The government then announced that it would seek to lower it to 13, and sent out the bill for input from 126 authorities and organisations.Their plans were met with criticism and opposition from different authorities and organisations.In November, the police authority said that the change risked \"significantly younger children\" getting involved in criminal gangs as a result.Other groups said the prison system was not equipped to handle such young offenders and detaining them could breach children's rights.The prison and probation service also said the move could lead to negative consequences for children and that they should be cared for in \"other ways\".Ministers had also previously considered imposing age limits on social media, with police arguing that gangs had used certain platforms to recruit young children into crime.Strommer said on Monday that he had taken note of the previous criticism of the bill, but that the situation had become more urgent.However opposition has not abated. Fredrik Hjulström, a local authority head who is reviewing the proposal, said it contained \"no factual arguments\", according to Swedish national broadcaster SVT.He added that children should receive care rather than being punished and argued that the bill was about scoring political points, with the country's general election coming up in September this year.Meanwhile lawyer Johan Eriksson agreed that action must be taken to prevent children from being recruited by gangs, but said lowering the age of criminal responsibility would likely have the opposite effect.The bill will be sent to Sweden's Council on Legislation, which reviews bills the government intends to put before parliament.",

    "body": "15 hours agoDearbail JordanandPeter HoskinsUS President Donald Trump has announced he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports to 25% after accusing Seoul of \"not living up\" to a trade deal reached last year.In a post on social media, Trump said he would increase levies on South Korea from 15% across a range of products including automobiles, lumber, pharmaceuticals and \"all other Reciprocal TARIFFS\".Trump said South Korean lawmakers have been slow to approve the deal while \"we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to\".South Korea said it had not been given official notice of the decision to raise tariffs on some of its goods, and wanted urgent talks with Washington over the issue.It added that South Korea's Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan, who is currently in Canada, will visit Washington as soon as possible to meet US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.South Korea exported goods worth about $123bn (£90bn) to the US last year, making it the second largest export market after China. Of these, car exports accounted for about $30bn.Initially, shares in Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kai fell by up to 6% in response to Trump's announcement, but they then recovered to close only about 1% lower.South Korea's benchmark Kospi stock index also reversed early losses to end the day up 2.7%.Analysts said investors were sceptical whether the threatened tariff rise would go ahead, pointing to Trump's recent U‑turn on imposing extra tariffs on European trade partners over opposition to US plans to acquire Greenland.\"With a delegation on its way from Seoul to Washington, markets are viewing this latest twist as more carrot than stick,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.Seoul and Washington reached a deal last October, which included a pledge from South Korea to invest $350bn (£256bn) in the US, some of which would go to shipbuilding.The following month, the two countries agreed that the US would reduce tariffs on some products once South Korea started the process to approve the deal.The agreement was submitted to South Korea's National Assembly on 26 November and is currently being reviewed. It is likely to be passed in February, according to local media.Tariffs are paid by companies who import products. In this case, US firms will pay a 25% tax on goods they buy from South Korea.Trump has frequently used tariffs as leverage to enact foreign policy during his second term in the White House.On Saturday, he threatened Canada with a 100% tariff if it struck a trade deal with China.On Monday, Chinese officials said its \"strategic partnership\" agreement with Canada is not meant to undercut other countries.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country was not pursuing a free trade deal with China and has \"never\" considered it.He added that Canadian officials have made their position clear to their American counterparts.Before that, Trump said he would impose import taxes on eight countries - including the UK - who opposed US plans to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark which is a member of Nato.He later backed down from the tariff threat over Greenland citing progress towards a \"future deal\" over the island, but the episode strained US relations with Denmark and other Nato allies.

    "body": "5 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentThe families of two Trinidadian men killed in a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat have filed a lawsuit against the American government.Lawyers filed the claim in Boston's federal court on behalf of relatives of Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, among six men killed off the coast of Venezuela on 14 October.One of the lawyers said in a statement that the strike amounted to \"lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theatre\".The US has struck at least 36 vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific since September, killing more than 120 people. The Trump administration has said it is targeting \"narco-terrorists\" carrying drugs that kill Americans. The US has positioned its operations as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.This lawsuit was filed on Tuesday under the Death on the High Seas Act, which allows family members to sue for wrongful deaths on the high seas, and is a statute that allows foreign citizens to sue in US courts for violating international law.The case was brought by Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister, who say the two men did fishing and farm work in Venezuela, and were returning to Trinidad and Tobago when their boat was struck. Joseph's mother Sallycar Korasingh added that if the US government believed her son had done something wrong, \"it should have arrested, charged and detained him, not murdered him\".The lawsuit argues that the killings should be deemed a wrongful death because the men were not taking part in military hostilities against the US.The Pentagon has not yet responded to requests for comment.It comes after the family of a Colombian man, who was killed in a separate US strike, took their case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorRoberto Schmidt/GettyThe images emanating from Minneapolis have shocked ItaliansThe US immigration agency whose officers have been involved in a fatal shooting in Minneapolis has said it is sending agents to help support American security operations during the Winter Olympics, which start in Italy on 6 February.Confirmation that a branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would play a role came from several US departments, after reports prompted alarm and anger in Italy.\"This is a militia that kills... of course they're not welcome in Milan,\" Milan Mayor Beppe Sala told Italian radio on Tuesday.Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, in a bid to cool tensions, told reporters \"it's not like the [Nazi] SS are coming\".He was speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony marking Holocaust Remembrance Day, attended by three Jewish Italians who survived the Holocaust.It is common for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and domestic law enforcement agencies to provide security support at major international events.DHS stressed that \"all security operations at the Olympics are directed and managed exclusively by Italian authorities\".Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Tuesday that no ICE agents would appear on Italian streets, only officers from the police, the Carabinieri military police and the Guardia di Finanza financial authority.The interior ministry said later that the US would set up an operations room at its consulate in Milan, where relevant US agencies would work during the Games.US embassy sources in Rome had already explained to Italian media that various federal agencies had worked at previous Games in the past, although it was not clear if ICE had itself taken part.US officials said the role of Homeland Security Investigations - which is part of ICE - would be \"strictly supportive - working with the Diplomatic Security Service and Italian authorities to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations\".It would \"obviously\" not conduct immigration enforcement operations outside the US, homeland security department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the BBC.Antonio Tajani told reporters that the ICE agents who were coming were not \"those with machine guns and their faces covered... they're coming because it's the department responsible for counter-terrorism\".Piero CRUCIATTI/AFPItalian troops in Milan - the Winter Olympics at Milan-Cortina take place from 6-22 FebruaryItaly's Interior Minister Matteo Pantedosi had initially appeared unaware that US immigration officials would be coming to the Milan-Cortina Olympics and said even if they were, foreign delegations could choose their own security, saying: \"I don't see what the problem is and it's very normal.\"But as shock at the images emanating from Minneapolis grew, so did the outcry in Italy that officers from the same US federal agency could appear on Italian streets. An ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on 7 January in a Minneapolis street, prompting nationwide protests.And in the aftermath of Alex Pretti being shot by US border patrol agents - from another DHS agency - on Saturday morning, two journalists for Italian public broadcaster Rai were threatened by ICE officials as the reporters drove around the city covering the agency's actions.The Rai TV report showed one agent warned the crew that if they kept filming the agents, their car window would be smashed.The governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, sought to calm the situation, suggesting that ICE agents would be deployed in Italy to protect US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Political opponents of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, such as Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia, warned that continued government silence on the issue would provide \"yet more evidence of cowardice and subservience towards Donald Trump\".The interior minister has since taken a stronger stand, maintaining on Monday that \"ICE will certainly not operate on Italian national territory\". The US had not communicated a list of security personnel, and security was guaranteed by the Italian state, he said.The centre-left mayor of Milan was unimpressed.\"I believe [ICE agents] shouldn't come to Italy because they don't guarantee they conform to our democratic way of ensuring security,\" Beppe Sala told RTL radio.",

    "body": "A string of scandals and luxury handbags: Who is South Korea's former first lady?2 hours agoGavin ButlerandHyojung Kim,BBC World ServiceGetty ImagesThe scandals Kim Keon Hee faces predate her husband Yoon's ill-fated political careerTwo Chanel handbags, a BMW dealership and a controversial church will all be at the centre of a trial faced by South Korea's former first lady this week.Kim Keon Hee, the wife of disgraced former president Yoon Suk Yeol, was arrested in August over a raft of charges including bribery, stock manipulation, and political interference - all of which she denies.On Wednesday, less than a fortnight after her husband was sentenced to five years' in jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid, Kim will receive the verdict in the first of three cases against her.Prosecutors say Kim, 52, made more than 800 million won ($552,570; £404,050) by participating in a price-rigging scheme involving the stocks of Deutsch Motors, a BMW dealer in South Korea, between October 2010 and December 2012.She is also accused of accepting luxury bags, a diamond necklace and other gifts worth up to 80m won as bribes from the controversial Unification Church in exchange for business favours, and receiving 58 free opinion polls, worth 270 million Korean won, from political broker Myung Tae-kyun before the 2022 presidential election.Wednesday's trial, which will be broadcast live from the court, marks the first time in history that a presidential spouse has been indicted while detained.But it is far from the first time Kim herself has been embroiled in controversy.Questionable credentialsBefore she was South Korea's first lady, Kim Keon Hee – born Kim Myeong-sin – was a businesswoman and art lover.She graduated with an art education degree from Sookmyung Women's University in 1999, but would later face repeated allegations of plagiarism over her time as a student there – leading the university to annul her degree in 2025 after its research ethics panel found her thesis was compromised.She has never commented on these allegations publicly. In 2009, she founded art exhibition company Covana Contents, for which she is still CEO and president – but in 2019 South Korean media reported that she had allegedly evaded paying taxes and received kickbacks for hosting art exhibitions. Kim, who has stood down from her role, was cleared of these charges in 2023, but the special counsel is currently re-examining the case.Then, ahead of the 2022 presidential election which her husband ultimately won, allegations emerged that Kim had submitted applications to universities and companies containing false qualifications and awards, sparking a scandal over potentially fabricated credentials.In response to these allegations, which some opposition members had sought to use as a political cudgel against Yoon, Kim issued a public apology for what she described as \"exaggerations\" on her resume.She further pledged that if her husband became president she would \"focus solely on my role as his wife\".It is her conduct while in that role, however, that has drawn some of the fiercest backlash.The handbag scandalIn late-2023, spy camera footage surfaced showing Kim receiving a luxury handbag from an individual in a Seoul office in September 2022.The footage was reported to have been secretly filmed by the pastor Choi Jae-young using a camera embedded in his watch – and its publication intensified public scrutiny on both Kim and Yoon.It appeared to show Mr Choi walking to a store to purchase the greyish-blue calfskin bag, with a receipt putting its cost at 3m won ($2,200; £1,800). Mr Choi then visits Covana Contents, a company in Seoul owned by the first lady, where Ms Kim then asks the pastor: \"Why do you keep bringing me these things?\"South Korean law makes it illegal for public officials and their spouses to receive gifts worth more than 1m won in one go, or a total of 3m won within a fiscal year.And while the video did not explicitly show Ms Kim accepting the gift, the Korea Herald reported at the time that the presidential office confirmed receipt of the bag and said that it was \"being managed and stored as a property of the government\".Getty ImagesYoon Suk Yeol and Kim Keon Hee mark the first time both a former president and former first lady have been jailedThe presidential office did not immediately respond to the coverage, further fuelling the controversy, as civic groups filed complaints with the prosecution citing potential violations of the Anti-Graft Act.This incident is one of 16 allegations looked into by the special counsel team, 12 of which were passed to police for further investigation.Wednesday's verdict, however, will focus on Kim allegedly accepting other bribes from the Unification Church, as well as her alleged involvement in Deutsch Motors stock manipulation and alleged election meddling.Kim has denied the charges - although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she says she later returned without using.Prosecutors last month called for a 15-year prison term and a fine of 2 billion won, saying she had \"stood above the law\" and colluded with the Unification Church to undermine the \"constitutionally mandated separation of religion and state\".DisgraceWhile Kim's string of scandals cast a shadow over her husband's presidential career, it was Yoon himself who ultimately sealed his own fate as one of South Korea's most disgraced former leaders.On 16 January, Yoon was found guilty of abuse of power, falsifying documents and obstructing justice when he tried and failed to impose martial law in the country in 2024. He has also been sentenced to five years in jail.It was the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to Yoon's shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said while delivering the verdict, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".It was during a year-long probe into Yoon's failed martial law attempt that special prosecutors started investigating many of the allegations against Kim.Together, the once-powerful-couple make a historic pair: while South Korea has a history of former presidents being indicted and imprisoned, Yoon and Kim mark the first time both a former president and former first lady have been jailed.",

    "body": "Flights returning to normal after Airbus warning grounded planes2 days agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThousands of Airbus planes are returning to normal service after being briefly grounded following a warning that solar radiation could interfere with onboard computers.The aerospace giant - based in France - said about 6,000 of its A320 planes had been affected, with most requiring a quick software update. Some 900 older planes need a replacement computer.On Saturday, French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the updates \"went very smoothly\" for more than 5,000 planes, and fewer than 100 still needed the update.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for what he called \"logistical challenges and delays\".He said teams were working to ensure that updates are completed \"as swiftly as possible\".On Saturday morning, several Air France flights in and out of Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport were delayed or cancelled.American Airlines said it expected \"operational delays\" but added that the vast majority of updates would be carried out by Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be limited.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said that airlines operating in the country worked through the night to carry out the update and air traffic had not been seriously affected.London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations.Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems, and Luton Airport reported that there was \"no expected impact\".British Airways and Air India are understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue.On Saturday, Easyjet said it had completed the update on a \"significant number\" of its aircraft, and planned to operate as normal.Wizz Air is also running as normal, having rolled out updates overnight.In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights. Most of its aircraft have now undergone the update, but some disruptions are expected though the weekend.Air New Zealand grounded its A320 planes, but all fights have now resumed after the update was completed.Airbus discovered the issue after a JetBlue Airways plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude and emergency landed in October. At least 15 people were injured.The firm identified a problem with the aircraft's computing software which calculates a plane's elevation, and found that at high altitudes, data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. As well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the A318, A319 and the A321 models were also affected.Older planes that require new computers remain grounded. How long the replacement takes will depend on the availability of computers.",

Police searched them and found \"magnetised probes\" and a mirror attachment for a phone allegedly used to rig games.The pair have been charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage and remain in custody.New South Wales Police said the couple had arrived in Sydney from Kazakhstan in October and applied for membership to the casino the same day.Over the following weeks, they made a number of visits to the casino - reportedly the Crown on Sydney's waterfront - and accumulated winnings totalling A$1,179,412.50.This raised the suspicions of casino staff, who allegedly caught them in the act on Thursday.Police said the spying devices were connected to the couple's mobile phones, allowing them to capture and view images of the table.NSW PoliceCasino staff noticed Dilnoza Israilova wearing the small, discreet camera on her Mickey Mouse T-shirtThey also wore hidden earpieces, through which they allegedly received instructions on when to wager on card games. A New South Wales Police spokesperson told the BBC that they were not currently looking for any other person in relation to the alleged fraud.In a subsequent search of their accommodation near the casino, officers found other \"gambling props\", high-end jewellery and €2,000 (£1,750; $2,320) in cash.The pair appeared in court on Friday and were denied bail, New South Wales police said.Mrs Israilova is due back in court in February, the Guardian Australia reports, while Mr Israilov is scheduled to appear on 11 December.",

    "body": "Four people have been arrested in South Korea for allegedly hacking more than 120,000 video cameras in homes and businesses and using the footage to make sexually exploitative materials for an overseas website.Police announced the arrests on Sunday, saying the accused exploited the Internet Protocol (IP) cameras' vulnerabilities, such as simple passwords.A cheaper alternative to CCTV, IP cameras - otherwise known as home cameras - connect to a home internet network and are often installed for security or to monitor the safety of children and pets.Locations of cameras hacked in the country reportedly included private homes, karaoke rooms, a pilates studio and a gynaecologist's clinic.A statement released by South Korea's National Police Agency revealed that the four suspects operated independently of one another, and did not conspire together.One of the suspects is accused of hacking 63,000 cameras and producing 545 sexually exploitative videos, which he then sold for 35 million won ($12,235; £9,250) worth of virtual assets. Another allegedly hacked 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for 18 million won worth of assets.The two suspects were responsible for approximately 62% of videos posted in the past year on a website that illegally distributed IP camera hacking footage.Police are now moving to block and shut down that website, and cooperating with foreign agencies to investigate its operator. They have also arrested three people who are suspected of having bought and viewed material through the site.\"IP camera hacking and illegal filming inflict immense suffering on victims and are therefore serious offences. We will eradicate them through vigorous investigations,\" said Park Woo-hyun, a cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency.\"Viewing and possessing illegally filmed videos are also serious crimes, so we will actively investigate them.\"Authorities have personally visited or notified victims at 58 locations, informing them of the incident and providing guidance on changing passwords.They are also helping victims delete and block content, and working to identify others who may have been affected.\"Above all, it is crucial and effective for individual users who have installed IP cameras in homes or business premises to remain vigilant and immediately and regularly change their access passwords,\" the National Police Agency said in its statement.",

The Labor leader's proposal and the wedding reception both took place at his official residence, The Lodge.ReutersAlbanese (right) alongside his son Nathan and his dog Toto - the ring bearerUntil the big day, the wedding plans had been kept under wraps due to concerns about security and potential disruptions.In attendance were Jodie Haydon's parents as well as Albanese's son, Nathan, from his previous marriage.Albanese's dog Toto acted as ring bearer while the couple walked back down the aisle to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\".The prime minister also shared a video on his official social media accounts showing the happy couple walking down the aisle as guests showered them in confetti.

The content being shared was not created or approved by us, and we have asked for it to be removed.\"While Keli Holiday is a friend of The Wiggles, the video and the music added to it were created independently and without our knowledge.\"The clip was filmed at the TikTok Awards earlier this month where members of the band appeared on stage with Holiday - whose real name is Adam Hyde - during his song Dancing2. Holiday shared the video on TikTok, with the caption \"The Wiggles get it\",  to promote his new single Ecstasy. The song's chorus lyrics are: \"Hey girl, come on dance with me. You and your pocket full of ecstasy.\"A spokesperson for The Wiggles told The West Australian newspaper that the band's performances at the awards had been \"family-friendly\" and that the video had been \"edited together separately and without our awareness\".Created in 1991 as part of a university assignment, The Wiggles has become an international phenomenon among young children. Anthony Fields is the only original member still with the group.Keli Holiday is the solo project of Hyde, who is also known for being one half of electronic dance duo Peking Duk.The BBC has contacted Holiday's management for comment.",

    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "body": "2 hours agoWill Grant,Central America correspondent, TegucigalpaandEmma RossiterEarly results from the general election in Honduras show Nasry Asfura, leader of the right-wing National Party, has a very narrow lead.With more than 40% of the votes counted, the conservative candidate was just ahead of former TV host and Vice-President Salvador Nasralla, according to preliminary results published by the National Electoral Council (CNE).Asfura has been backed by US President Donald Trump, who has threatened to cut financial aid to the Central American nation if his preferred candidate does not win. Stressing that the results were both \"preliminary and partial\", the head of the CNE said that the race was on a knife-edge between the two conservative candidates. Asfura is fractionally in the lead with 40.5% of the vote, while his nearest challenger, Nasralla, is on 39%. In third place is the ruling left-wing Libre party candidate, Rixi Moncada, at about 20%. There are five presidential candidates, but the poll is essentially being seen as a three-way race.There are still a lot of ballots left to be counted, and the lead could easily change hands as the votes come in, especially from the more remote communities. However, so far it has been an encouraging night for Asfura's supporters – both in Honduras, and in Washington.Voting was extended for an hour in some places where there were long queues, but most Hondurans it seems were able to cast their votes without issue. The main parties and their candidates have all said they will respect the outcome of the election – although the Libre party has said it will not accept a decision based on preliminary results, only on the final count of the paper ballots.Presidents in Honduras can only serve a single four-year term, so the incumbent, Xiomara Castro, who was the country's first female president when she took office in 2021 for the Libre party, was not on the ballot.She has backed Moncada to take her place. The 60-year-old lawyer has pledged to protect \"natural wealth\" from \"21st Century filibusters who want to privatise everything\" if she wins. Moncada has also expressed her commitment to combating corruption \"in all its forms\".On Saturday, Moncada accused Trump of meddling in the election, calling his endorsement of her right-wing opponent \"totally interventionist\".Trump had said that the US would be \"very supportive\" if Asfura won the presidential election, in which voters were also choosing all 128 members of Congress and almost 300 local representatives.\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.The US sent more than $193m (£146m) to Honduras last fiscal year, according to the State Department website, and despite aid cuts, has sent more than $102m this year. The Trump administration has already reportedly cut $167m in economic and governance aid that had been earmarked for 2024 and 2025, the Congress website says.In another post, Trump wrote that he and Asfura, who is the former mayor of the capital, Tegucigalpa, could \"work together to fight the Narcocommunists\" and counter drug trafficking.Nasry Asfura has pledged in a series of social media posts to bring \"development and opportunities for everyone\", to \"facilitate foreign and domestic investment into the country\" and \"generate employment for all\".However, his party has been plagued by scandals and corruption accusations in recent years - including the sentencing of former party leader and ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández last year.Hernández was jailed for 45 years in the US on drug smuggling and weapons charges - a decision Trump now intends to overturn.Asfura has carefully tried to distance himself from Hernández. On Friday he told news agency AFP that he has \"no ties\" with the ex-president, and that \"the party is not responsible for his personal actions\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoFlora DruryandBBC IndonesianWatch: BBC reports from the site of deadly flooding in West SumatraThe death toll in the floods which struck Indonesia last week has now climbed to more than 500, with rescue workers still battling to reach affected areas.The floods, which were caused by a rare cyclone that had formed over the Malacca Strait, have hit three provinces and impacted some 1.4 million people, according to the government's disaster agency.Another 500 people remain missing, while thousands more have been injured.Indonesia is just one part of Asia which has been hit with torrential rain and storms in recent days, with Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka all also reporting deaths.In Indonesia, the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have been hardest hit, with thousands still cut off and without critical supplies.Arini Amalia, a resident from Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, told the BBC the floodwaters had been \"like a tsunami\".\"According to my grandmother, this is the worst, the worst in her life,\" Amalia said.Aid workers have been trying to reach people on foot and by motorcycle, as many roads are impassable to larger vehicles.Pictures from the region show bridges washed away, roads covered in mud and debris, and logs piled high.At West Sumatra's Twin Bridges landmark, where floodwaters swept through and deposited enormous amounts of mud and debris, Mariana watched as excavators cleared the roads, hoping they would find her missing family members including her 15-year-old son.\"Watching the excavators, seeing how thick the mud is… I keep thinking, what condition will my child be in when they find him?\" she said. \"Will he still be intact? My mother, my brother-in-law… Looking at how it is here, maybe their faces won't even be recognisable any more.\"ReutersThe floods have impacted some 1.4 million people in IndonesiaMany are still waiting for food aid, with some saying they have not eaten for two to three days.Maysanti, who lives in Central Tapanuli which is one of the worst-hit areas in North Sumatra, told the BBC that aid workers were having trouble reaching her district.\"Everything is gone; our food supplies are running out. We can't eat,\" she said. \"Even instant noodles are being fought over now. Our food is gone; we need food and rice. Access to us is completely cut off.\"She said she has to walk kilometres away from her house to get an internet connection and basic necessities, like clean water.In Central Aceh where local authorities have provided Starlink devices, thousands were seen queuing outside the regency's office on Sunday night hoping to contact their loved ones or charge their mobile phones.\"It's been five days with no signal. We've been waiting since yesterday in case the network comes back. I'm planning to call my mother in Banda Aceh, but until now I still can't reach her,\" said one resident called Mar.As rescue efforts continue, anger has started to grow towards the government's disaster response.Critics say that authorities were ill-prepared for the floods. Some have blamed bureaucratic red tape for slowing down the distribution of food aid.On Monday, President Prabowo Subianto - who was visiting some of the flood affected areas in North Sumatra - acknowledged some roads were still cut off, but added \"we're doing everything we can to overcome difficulties\".\"We face this disaster with resilience and solidarity,\" he continued. \"Our nation is strong right now, able to overcome this.\"Indonesia's monsoon season, which generally runs between November and March, often brings heavy rain.While it is hard to link individual extreme weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making storms more frequent and intense, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.",

    "body": "Venezuela has condemned US President Donald Trump's statement that the airspace around the country should be considered closed.The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\". The US does not have legal authority to close another country's airspace and the Venezuelan statement accused Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\". The US has built its military presence in the area and carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80, without providing evidence. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has said the US actions are attempt to oust him.Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.Some Democratic and Republican members of the US Congress have expressed anger that Trump has not sought legislative approval.\"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer posted on X on Sunday.\"Under our constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said: \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Trump's comments come just days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\", leading to several major airlines suspending flights there. Caracas then rescinded their take-off and landing rights.Venezuela's foreign ministry urged \"the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organisations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression\", in a statement on Saturday. The same day, Venezuela's military conducted exercises along coastal areas, with state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being manoeuvred.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment - the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 - is to combat drug trafficking.Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US is to depose the left-wing Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many nations as rigged.Fellow left-wing President Gustavo Petro of Colombia - who has also faced US sanctions - has said he believed the US was using \"violence to dominate\" Latin America, though other leaders in the region have welcomed Trump's stance.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.",

    "body": "15 hours agoImogen Foulkes,GenevaandTom BennettThe founder of the Swiss right-to-die organisation Dignitas has died by assisted suicide, the group says.Ludwig Minelli, 92, died on Saturday, days before his 93rd birthday.The group paid tribute to Minelli, saying he had led a \"life for freedom of choice, self-determination, and human rights\".Minelli founded Dignitas in 1998, and since then it has helped thousands of people to die. In recent decades, some countries have shifted their stance on assisted dying, with Australia, Canada and New Zealand introducing laws. The UK House of Lords is currently debating the assisted dying bill. Critics of the legalisation say it could see disabled and vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives.Minelli began his career as a journalist, working as a correspondent for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, before studying law and taking an interest in human rights.Across his life, he campaigned passionately for the right to die, giving Dignitas the slogan \"dignity in life, dignity in death\". In a 2010 interview with the BBC, he said: \"I am persuaded that we have to struggle in order to implement the last human right in our societies. And the last human right is the right to make a decision on one's own end, and the possibility to have this end without risk and without pain.\"Minelli founded Dignitas after splitting from the older Swiss assisted dying organisation, Exit, because he felt its rules were too restrictive. The group became world famous because it offers assisted suicide to non-Swiss citizens who travel to Switzerland because assisted dying is not permitted in their own countries.Within Switzerland he was sometimes criticised for an alleged lack of transparency over the financial dealings of the organisation, and for offering assisted dying to those who were not terminally ill, but who wanted to end their lives.He faced numerous legal challenges, and made multiple successful appeals to the Swiss supreme courtIn a statement, Dignitas said his work had had a lasting influence, pointing to a 2011 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, in which it confirmed the right of a person capable of judgement to decide on the manner and the time of their own end of life.Euthanasia - when a lethal drug is administered by a physician to deliberately end a person's life to relieve suffering - is illegal in Switzerland.But assisted dying has been permitted under Swiss law since 1942, under strict conditions including a stipulation that there is no profit motive involved, and that the individual wishing to die is of sound mind.Dignitas said in a statement that it would continue to \"manage and develop the association in the spirit of its founder as a professional and combative international organisation for self-determination and freedom of choice in life and at the end of life\".If you've been affected by issues in this article, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

Eleven others were injured in the incident at a restaurant in the state's northern city of Stockton.A suspect is still on the loose and police say they believe the shooting may have been \"targeted\".The city's deputy mayor earlier said the shooting had occurred \"at a children's birthday party\". Police have not confirmed the type of event at which the shooting occurred, beyond it being a family gathering.\"[A] birthday party should never be a place where families fear for their lives,\" Deputy Mayor Jason Lee wrote on social media.The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT on Sunday), and is appealing to anyone with \"information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of the incident\" to come forward.Spokeswoman Heather Brent described the incident as \"unfathomable\", adding: \"This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited.\"Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities.\"Stockton's Mayor Christina Fugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\".\"Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.\"California has some of the strictest firearm laws in the US, and has in recent years faced challenges to it.In 2021, a federal judge overturned the state's ban on assault weapons, such as the AR-15 rifle. The following year, the US Supreme Court expanded gun rights as it struck down a New York law restricting gun-carrying rights, jeopardising similar regulation in California.''Families should be together instead of at the hospital'', says Stockton's mayor",

It is decorated with thousands of blue and turquoise ceramic tiles and receives millions of visitors each year.Pope Francis prayed there in 2014, and Pope Benedict XVI did so in 2006.The first pope to officially enter a mosque was John Paul II, who made history when he visited the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in 2001. The papal visit to Turkey and Lebanon had been planned by late Pope Francis, but its theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.At the start of his trip, he warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", adding that \"the future of humanity is at stake\".In Lebanon - where an estimated third of the country is Christian - he is expected to meet more faith leaders and hear from young people. On the final day of the trip, he will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.",

    "body": "The abrupt cancellations of several Japanese music events in Shanghai - one of them midway through a song - have sparked criticism among fans, with some calling the moves \"rude\" and \"extreme\".Maki Otsuki was halfway through the theme of hit anime One Piece on Friday when the lights and music went off, after which she was rushed off stage by two crew members.On Saturday, pop star Ayumi Hamasaki performed to an empty 14,000-seat stadium after organisers axed her concert in Shanghai, citing \"force majeure\".This spate of cancellations come as diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Tokyo fester over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on Taiwan.While responding to a question in parliament last month, Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan.Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it.Both sides have since lodged protests against each other, and the rift has also affected daily living in both countries.Otsuki's management attributed the interruption of her performance on Friday to \"unavoidable circumstances\". \"Other than the performance being cancelled, there were no particular problems, and the local staff were very kind and helpful,\" it wrote in a separate statement on Monday, in which it declined interviews on the matter.Her performance was part of a three-day music festival in Shanghai, for which subsequent events were also called off after \"comprehensively taking into consideration various factors\", according to Japan's Kyodo News.The BBC has reached out to Japanese entertainment company Bandai Namco, who is one of the organisers of the festival.Asked about the incident at a daily media conference on Monday, a spokesperson from Beijing's foreign ministry told reporters: \"I suggest you chat with the Chinese organisers.\"Some of Otsuki's fans have made a meme comparing the shutting down of her performance with the shocking removal of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given \"the Hu Jintao treatment\".On social media, some accused the Chinese authorities of taking away its own people's freedom to enjoy culture, in its attempts to sanction Japan. \"What's the point of turning the spearhead toward its own citizens?\" read an X post written in Japanese.\"Don't you care about the audience - they are after all Chinese, right?\" wrote a user on China's X-like platform Weibo. George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, joined the conversation online. \"It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music,\" he wrote in an X post which also included a link to Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. \"Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!\" he wrote.However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. \"How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?\" a Weibo user wrote.Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the \"people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour\" she wrote on Instagram.\"I still strongly believe that entertainment should be a bridge that connects people, and I want to be on the side of creating that bridge,\" she wrote.Two weeks ago, Chinese state media announced that the releases of at least two popular Japanese anime films will be postponed amid the diplomatic row.

    "body": "The US National Park Service (NPS) is removing Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth from its list of fee-free entrance days.The move is part of President Donald Trump's \"modernisation\" of the park service, which, beginning in 2026, also includes changing the parks' cost structure to favour American citizens over foreign visitors, following a July executive order from Trump.In addition to removing the two holidays that celebrate civil rights leader MLK Jr and the end of slavery in the US, the agency is adding Flag Day, which is also Trump's birthday, as a \"patriotic\" fee-free day. People who are not US citizens will still have to pay fees on the fee-free dates, the NPS said.For the 2026 calendar year, US residents will be granted free access to national parks on President's Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day/President Trump's birthday, Independence Day weekend, 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt's birthday and Veteran's Day.Previously, Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth were both deemed fee-free entry days by the Biden administration.Under the Trump administration's new rules, US residents will continue to pay $80 (£60) for an annual park service pass. But for non-residents, the cost will rise from $80 to to $250, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the park service, announced last month. Those without a  pass will now pay $100 per person, in addition to the standard entrance fee, at 11 of the most visited parks. \"President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. \"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" Burgum's statement continued. In May, the department estimated in its budget proposal for 2026 fiscal year that surcharges for foreign visitors would bring in more than $90 million per year.  This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted Juneteenth and MLK Jr Day. On his first day in office this year, Trump issued an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes from federal agencies, which led many agencies to bar celebrations of holidays seen as DEI-related, including MLK Jr Day and Juneteenth. However, the two dates remain national holidays. In June, the Trump administration held a military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happened to fall on both Flag Day and Trump's birthday. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. ",

    "body": "1 hour agoVikas Pandey,GoaandHarry SekulichA fire at a popular nightclub in India's coastal region of Goa has killed 25 people, local officials say. Most of the victims are believed to be staff at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, located near a popular beach. Tourists are also said to be among the dead.Police believe a gas cylinder exploded in the club's kitchen, causing a blaze to rip through the venue on Saturday at midnight local time.The nightclub's manager has been arrested and an arrest warrant for the owner has been issued.Goa is a former Portuguese colony on the Arabian Sea. Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.Eyewitnesses told the BBC of scenes of panic in the bustling nightlife area.One eyewitness said that it was a usual Saturday night and holidaymakers were enjoying themselves.He said: \"I was outside the club when I heard screams, I didn't initially understand what was going on. \"In a bit, it became clear that a massive fire had broken out. The scenes were just horrific.\"The venue was packed because it was hosting a Bollywood specialist DJ. Though the main entrance is wide, the crossing on the small lake leading to the main structure is narrow and that made it difficult for firefighters to reach the spot.The BBC saw what appeared to be melted remains of chairs, tables and plants in one corner of the club.\"The fire was mainly concentrated around the kitchen area on the ground floor,\" said Goa police chief Alok Kumar.Most of the bodies were found near the kitchen \"suggesting that the victims were employed at the club\", Mr Alok Kumar added.Goa's chief minister Pramod Sawant told journalists three people had died from burn injuries, while others died by suffocating.He said \"three to four\" tourists had perished but did not provide their ages or nationalities. Six people are in a stable condition in hospital.A chef who works at a nearby venue told the BBC he knew some of the workers at the Birch club.\"People from all over the country and also from Nepal work in different clubs in Goa,\" he said.\"I am really worried for some people who I knew at the club. Their phones are off.\"Early on Sunday emergency teams were combing through the charred wreckage to determine the cause of the blaze.A heavy security presence remained at the scene, with the doors to the nightclub shut and no-one allowed inside.Rescue workers have taken the bodies of the victims to Goa Medical College in Panaji. Eight bodies have so far been identified as workers from other Indian states including Jharkhand, Assam and Uttarakhand.One of the firefighters at the scene told the BBC they were still identifying the victims and would then notify their families.An inquiry into the cause of the fire has been launched, the chief minister said.\"Those found responsible will face most stringent action under the law – any negligence will be dealt with firmly,\" Dr Sawant said.\"I am deeply grieved and offer my heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved families.\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Goa fire \"deeply saddening\" in a post on social media.About 5.5 million tourists visited Goa in the first half of the year, government data showed, with 270,000 coming from abroad.Some opposition politicians the BBC spoke to said that stricter regulations were needed to avoid such tragedies.They alleged that newer clubs are opening too frequently and the government needs to ensure they are safe for people to visit.India has seen a number of deadly fires at entertainment venues in recent years.A fire at a three-storey building killed 17 in the southern city of Hyderabad in May, while a hotel blaze in north-east Kolkata left 15 dead a month earlier.Last year, 24 died at an amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat after visitors were trapped inside. An official review later found poor safety standards contributed to the death toll.",

    "body": "A drone attack on the town of Kalogi, in Sudan's South Kordofan region, is said to have hit a kindergarten and killed at least 50 people, including 33 children. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group battling the army in Sudan's civil war, was accused of Thursday's attack by a medical organisation, the Sudan Doctors' Network, and the army.There was no immediate comment from the RSF. The RSF in turn accused the army of hitting a market on Friday in a drone attack in the Darfur region, on a fuel depot at the Adre border crossing with Chad.Sudan has been ravaged by war since April 2023 when a power struggle broke out between the RSF and the army, who were formerly allies .The reports could not be verified independently.   According to the army-aligned foreign ministry, the kindergarten was struck twice with missiles from drones.Civilians and medics who rushed to the school were also attacked, it added.Responding to reports of the attack in Kalogi, a spokesman for the UN children's agency Unicef said: \"Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children's rights.\"\"Children should never pay the price of conflict,\" Sheldon Yett added.The agency, he said, urged \"all parties to stop these attacks immediately and allow safe, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to reach those in desperate need\".The RSF accused the army of attacking the Adre crossing because it was used for the \"delivery of aid and commercial supplies\". According to the Sudan War Monitor, a group of researchers tracking the conflict, the attack caused civilian casualties and significant damage to a market.The military did not immediately comment on the reports from Darfur.Wedged between Sudan's capital Khartoum and Darfur, the region made up of North Kordofan, South Kordofan and West Kordofan has been a frontline in the civil war.The battle for the Kordofans - which have a population of almost eight million - has intensified as the army pushes towards Darfur.",

Eyewitnesses told the BBC that they had heard gunshots and some journalists working for the state broadcaster were held hostage.A presidential adviser has since told the BBC that the president is safe and is at the French embassy.\"Early on Sunday morning, 7 December 2025, a small group of soldiers launched a mutiny aimed at destabilising the state and its institutions,\" Interior Minister Alassane Seidou said\"Faced with this situation, the Beninese armed forces and their leadership, true to their oath, remained committed to the republic. Their response allowed them to retain control of the situation and foil the attempt,\" he said.\"The government therefore urges the population to go about their activities as normal.\"Helicopters have been seen flying over Cotonou and roads are blocked with a heavy military presence on several streets in the city.Benin, a former French colony, has been regarded as one of Africa's more stable democracies.It is one of the continent's largest cotton producers, but ranks among the world's poorest countries.The French and Russian embassies have urged their citizens to stay indoors for their safety.The US embassy's advice was to stay away from Cotonou, especially the area around the presidential compound.The soldiers leading the attempted coup justified their actions by criticising President Talon's management of the country.\"The army solemnly commits to give the Beninese people the hope of a truly new era, where fraternity, justice and work prevail,\" said a statement read by one of the soldiers.Talon, who is 67 and regarded as a close ally of the West, is due to step down next year after completing his second term in office, with elections scheduled for April.A businessman known as the \"king of cotton\", he first came to power in an election in 2016. He promised not to seek a third term and has endorsed Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni as his successor.Talon has been praised by supporters for overseeing economic development, but his government has also come in for criticism for suppressing dissenting voices.In October the electoral commission barred the main opposition candidate from standing on the grounds that he did not have enough sponsors.Last month, several constitutional amendments were passed by MPs, including the creation of a second parliamentary chamber, the Senate.Terms of office for elected officials were extended from five to seven years, but the presidential two-term limit remained in place.AFPPresident Patrice Talon, a businessman known as the \"king of cotton\", has said he intends step down next year after two terms in officeThis coup attempt in Benin comes just over a week after Umaro Sissoco Embaló was overthrown as president in nearby Guinea-Bissau.In recent years, there have been several coups in West Africa, including in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Niger, heightening fears that the security of the region could worsen.Russia has strengthened its ties with these Sahel countries over recent years - and Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have left the West African regional bloc Ecowas to form their own group, the Alliance of Sahel States.According to BBC Monitoring, news of the coup attempt was hailed by several pro-Russian influencer accounts on social media.Benin has seen a rise in jihadist activity in recent years, as groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda spread to the south.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "The death toll in Indonesia from recent flooding has passed 900, with hundreds still missing.More than 100,000 homes were destroyed when a rare and powerful cyclone formed over the Malaca Strait last week, bringing torrential rain and landslides to parts of the South East Asian country.Efforts to reach people in areas still cut off are ongoing, with aid having to be airdropped into some places.The Indonesia floods were one of several extreme weather events to hit Asia in recent weeks, with the cumulative death toll in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam approaching 2,000. In Aceh Tamiang, one of the hardest-hit areas of Indonesia, survivors described villages being entirely swept away by fast-moving deluges.One survivor in Lintang Bawah Village told the BBC Indonesian service that people survived by sitting on top of their homes.Fitriana said: \"There were also those who survived on the roofs of their houses with their four-year-old children, for three days without eating or drinking.\"She said around 90% of the homes in her village were destroyed, leaving 300 families with nowhere to go.One man recounted how he and his family were evacuated by boat when the floodwaters inundated his home up to the second floor, only for them to need to flee again from a nearby village.He said: \"That night, while we were sleeping, water suddenly soaked the mattresses we were sleeping on [in Gampoeng Dalam Village]. But we couldn't go anywhere else, because there was no higher ground.\"Luckily, my daughter-in-law's house was on two levels. So we climbed upstairs and that's where we survived.\"The region's governor said response teams were still searching for bodies in \"waist-deep\" mud, according to the AFP news agency. He said: \"Many people need basic necessities. Many areas remain untouched in the remote areas of Aceh.\"People are not dying from the flood, but from starvation. That's how it is.\"Indonesian media reported inmates were released from one prison when floodwaters threatened to engulf the facility, with officials saying there was nowhere else for them to be sent.Land access to two areas, Sibolga City and Central Tapanuli, remained cut off as of Sunday, with aid only able to reach them by air and sea respectively. There have been reports of looting at supermarkets in some areas.",

    "body": "Russia continued its air strikes on Ukraine overnight, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had a \"very constructive\" phone call with Donald Trump's negotiating team following three days of talks in Florida.Early on Sunday the mayor of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in central Ukraine, said the city had been repeatedly struck in a \"massive\" attack. No deaths have been confirmed so far.Meanwhile, Russia said it had shot down 77 Ukrainian drones in several locations.Aerial assaults have continued even as efforts to negotiate an end to the war have intensified, including detailed Ukraine-US talks in Miami aimed at drafting a peace settlement acceptable to both sides.On Saturday, Zelensky said he was \"determined\" to continue working with the US after speaking to Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the conclusion of those negotiations. Zelensky said they had discussed how to ensure that Russia stuck to any potential deal to end the war.Hours later, Kremenchuk Mayor Vitaliy Maletsk said his city had sustained a \"massive combined strike\" on its infrastructure. The extent of the damage was unclear as of Sunday morning but the mayor said water, electricity and heat had been cut off for some.The city, which is roughly halfway between Kyiv and the frontline in the east, has been repeatedly targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The White House has pushed Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a multi-point plan to end the war but there has been little sign of a breakthrough, despite both sides engaging with the US-led process.\"Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,\" Zelensky said on X. \"We covered many aspects and went through key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full scale invasion.\"The Russian strikes in the early hours of Sunday followed a wider attack 24 hours earlier, which drew condemnation from Kyiv's European allies.In a social media post, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had spoken to Zelensky and offered his \"full solidarity\". \"France is determined to work with all partners to secure de-escalation measures and to impose a ceasefire,\" Macron added. Macron, Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are due to hold in-person talks in London on Monday.Europe has pushed back against early versions of the US-led peace plan and has sought to win support from the White House for its own proposals, including comprehensive security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, including the possibility of a peacekeeping force.Sir Keir has led the push for a so-called coalition of the willing, a loose collection of Ukrainian allies who are committed to continuing to underwrite Kyiv's defence in the event of a ceasefire to deter a second invasion. He has called that proposal \"vital\" for Ukraine's long-term security.Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the idea of such a force saying any troops deployed to Ukraine would be \"legitimate targets\".Also on Saturday, US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\".The joint statement was issued days after Witkoff returned from talks with Putin at the Kremlin which failed to produce a breakthrough.Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, newly installed as Zelensky's most senior negotiator, said they had \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business Correspondent, TokyoGetty ImagesAround seven million people suffer from dementia in JapanLast year, more than 18,000 older people living with dementia left their homes and wandered off in Japan. Almost 500 were later found dead.Police say such cases have doubled since 2012, underscoring a growing strain on the world's oldest society.The crisis is further compounded by a shrinking workforce and tight limits on foreign workers coming in to provide care.Japan's government has identified dementia as one of its most urgent policy challenges, with the Health Ministry estimating that dementia-related health and social care costs will reach 14 trillion yen ($90bn; £67bn) by 2030 - up from nine trillion yen in 2025. In its most recent strategy, the government has signalled a stronger pivot toward technology to ease the pressure.Across the country, people are adopting GPS-based systems to keep track of those who wander.Some regions offer wearable GPS tags that can alert authorities the moment a person leaves a designated area.In some towns, convenience-store workers receive real-time notifications – a kind of community safety net that can locate a missing person within hours.Robot caregivers and AIOther technologies aim to detect dementia earlier.Fujitsu's aiGait uses AI to analyse posture and walking patterns, picking up early signs of dementia – shuffling while walking, slower turns or difficulty standing – generating skeletal outlines clinicians can review during routine check-ups.\"Early detection of age-related diseases is key,\" says Hidenori Fujiwara, a Fujitsu spokesperson. \"If doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer.\"Meanwhile, researchers at Waseda University are developing AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot designed to be a \"future\" caregiver.It can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change diapers and prevent bedsores in patients.Scientists at Waseda University in Tokyo are developing caregiving robotsSimilar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises.They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds.Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.\"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation,\" he says.Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive.Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation.\"We're focusing on social issues... and to use new technology to help solve those problems,\" Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC.Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken OrdersWhile devices and robots offer new ways to assist, though, human connection remains irreplaceable.\"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers,\" Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. \"While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients.\"At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia.Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful.Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what.Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.\"Honestly? I wanted a little pocket money. I like meeting all sorts of people,\" Mr Morita says. \"Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun.\"Getty ImagesSharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patients",

    "body": "50 minutes agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterKaty Perry and former Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau have gone Instagram official after the singer posted a string of photographs and videos of their trip to Japan.In one picture, Perry and Trudeau are seen smiling for a selfie, with their faces touching. In another video, the pair are seen trying sushi.Neither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for months with multiple pictures of the two together.Trudeau was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.Perry was visiting Japan as part of her global Lifetimes Tour.The 41-year-old accompanied her Instagram carousel with the caption: \"Tokyo times on tour and more.\"Earlier this week, Trudeau, 53, also reposted a photograph of the pair together alongside the former prime minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko.Writing on X, he said: \"Great to see you @kishida230. Katy and I were so glad to have the chance to sit down with you and Yuko.\"Thank you, Fumio, for your friendship and your continued commitment to both the international rules-based order and to a better future for everyone.\"Last month, the pair appeared to confirm their relationship after being photographed holding hands at an event in Paris.Celebrity news site TMZ published the photographs and video footage of the pair walking hand-in-hand before getting into a car. Trudeau was seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.The appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.Perry and Trudeau did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.During a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.After a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.Perry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.",

    "body": "6 hours agoTessa WongSingaporeGetty ImagesHongkongers are mourning the worst blaze the city has seen in more than 70 yearsHongkongers are voting in an election seen as a test of public sentiment following a deadly fire that angered some in the city.The government has mounted a huge campaign to encourage Hongkongers to choose members of the Legislative Council (LegCo). All of the candidates have been vetted to ensure they are loyal to China.The election takes place as many are mourning the Tai Po fire last month which killed nearly 160 people.In recent days, authorities have distributed aid to survivors, arrested suspects and sought to improve building safety, as some Hongkongers raise questions about the incident.A total of 161 candidates are competing for 90 seats in the LegCo, which acts as a mini parliament and can make and amend laws.The election is the second since 2021 when China made sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system to ensure only \"patriots\" could run for seats. Beijing has said the changes, which were put in place shortly after the 2019 protests, were necessary to ensure stability in Hong Kong, but critics say they weakened democracy.The last poll, which took place shortly after those changes, saw its lowest-ever turnout of 30% amid widespread voter apathy.This year, the government has blanketed the city with posters urging Hongkongers to head to the polls, while dangling freebies and shopping discounts.After casting their vote, each person will receive a \"thank you card\" that could be redeemed for vouchers in selected shops and restaurants, or for beauty services, medical check-ups and insurance policy premiums.Authorities are also offering free entry to public swimming pools and museums on the polling day, organising carnivals in various neighbourhoods, and holding a televised variety show and gala. They have also created cartoon mascots and a theme tune for the election, adapted from a 2001 hit song by Cantopop star Aaron Kwok, called \"Let's Vote, Together We Create The Future\".Chief Secretary Eric Chan told reporters last month that the measures were aimed at ensuring \"a happy and festive mood\" and to \"let residents recognise the importance of the election\".VCG via Getty ImagesThe Hong Kong government has launched a campaign urging residents to voteBut in recent days the city has been focusing on the 26 November fire that engulfed high-rise residential blocks at Wang Fuk Court in the northern district of Tai Po.The blaze was the worst seen in Hong Kong in more than 70 years. The death toll, which currently stands at 159, is likely to rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.As Hong Kong mourns its dead, some are asking whether the fire could have been prevented and questioning building safety standards. Many Hongkongers live in ageing high-rise buildings similar to Wang Fuk Court.Authorities have since ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of the fire, and have arrested 13 people for suspected manslaughter. They have also ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh used in all building renovations across the city. Investigators have found that a scaffolding mesh used for renovations in Wang Fuk Court failed to meet flame retardant standards, and that the fire spread quickly due to the mesh and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings.Authorities have also moved quickly to quell dissent. Police have reportedly detained a man, who was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry, for suspected sedition on Saturday. The petition was also wiped from the Internet.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police.Political campaigning for the LegCo election was immediately suspended following the fire, though government-organised debate forums resumed after a few days. Carnivals organised for the election campaign have also been cancelled.Hong Kong chief executive John Lee has insisted the LegCo election continue as planned as \"we must move forward before we can turn our grief into strength\".He said that the new legislators would be able to quickly support reconstruction and reforms.John P Burns, emeritus professor and Chinese politics expert with the University of Hong Kong, said he believed the government would interpret a high turnout as a sign that voters perceive Hong Kong's reshaped political system as \"relatively legitimate\".But he expected the numbers to be low, in part due to the Tai Po fire.He pointed out that most Hongkongers have traditionally supported the pan-democrat opposition - which have been effectively barred from taking part. \"I think they won't be convinced to participate this time, just as they mostly stayed away in 2021,\" he said.Mobilising the pro-establishment voters following the fire would be difficult for the government as well, he added.Some in that camp will be impressed by how authorities have speedily re-housed those made homeless in the fire and the aid authorities have provided, \"which by any measure has been rapid and relatively generous\", noted Prof Burns.But others \"may stay away from the polls\" as they are \"disappointed, even angry, by the governance problems the fire has exposed\", he said.Hong Kong's national security office this week reposted a commentary from a pro-Beijing news outlet that urged residents to vote to show support for government's reconstruction efforts.\"Building a good future together starts with this vote. If you truly love Hong Kong, you should sincerely vote,\" the commentary said.VCG via Getty ImagesHong Kong has been blanketed with posters for the Legco electionThis year's LegCo election will feature a number of new faces with about a quarter of the incumbent lawmakers stepping down.Local media have reported that Beijing pressured several lawmakers to retire as they have unofficially set an age limit. A number of those stepping down are aged above 70, including the prominent politician Regina Ip, a former security chief nicknamed the \"Iron Lady\". ",

    "body": "21 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, BethlehemWatch: Bethlehem Christmas tree lights up for first time since Gaza warFor two years during the Gaza war, all public celebrations for Christmas were cancelled in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank – where Christians believe Jesus was born.But after the recent ceasefire, the holy city decided that this year the festivities would return as symbolised by the lighting of its traditional, giant Christmas tree in front of the historic Nativity Church.\"It's been a bad two years of silence; no Christmas, no jobs, no work,\" says Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati. \"We're all living here from tourism and tourism was down to zero.\"The mayor accepts that the idea of resuming celebrations was not without controversy, as suffering continues in Gaza – including for those in its tiny Christian community, many of whom have relatives in Bethlehem.\"Some may say it's not appropriate and others say it's appropriate,\" Mr Canawati tells me. \"But deep inside my heart, I felt that this was the right thing to do because Christmas should never be stopped or cancelled. This is the light of hope for us.\"Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to BethlehemOne tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare systemAlaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurantThe grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.",

    "body": "Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / MoxleyByChris Fawkes Lead Weather PresenterWitnessing a dazzling display of the Northern Lights with vivid sheets of colour dancing across the night sky is a real treat for those lucky enough to be in the right place at just the right time. But the charged particles hurled into space by our tempestuous Sun - the particles that create the aurora borealis - can also unleash very rare but extremely disruptive events here on Earth. Electricity supplies, satellites and air travel can all be affected by the most violent solar storms.Recently 6,000 planes were grounded by Airbus, requiring a software update after one of their planes experienced a \"sudden drop in altitude\" in October thought to be caused by interference from intense solar radiation.This kind of disruption is something that scientists and governments are actively researching and planning for.What damage can solar storms cause?The UK government publishes The National Risk Register, external - a list of serious hazards that could affect the country at some point in the future. It catalogues the sorts of nightmare scenarios that give politicians sleepless nights.Alongside risks such as nuclear incidents, terrorist attacks and outbreaks of disease sits the threat of severe space weather.Image source, Nasa/Goddard/SDO/PA WireImage caption, A photo of a solar flare on the left side of the Sun hurling charged particles into spaceMuch of the planning for a severe space weather is based on the Carrington Event of 1859, the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history.  This created rapid variations in the Earth's magnetic field that caused electricity to be generated in long wires. Telegraph operators suffered electric shocks, pylons were seen to spark and some conversations between operators could carry on while batteries were disconnected. All this happened a long time ago, but with today's advanced technologies the effects of a similar event would be far more disruptive.Satellites can be badly affected. Strong solar storms can cause the Earth's atmosphere to expand out into space, which creates more drag for satellites. This can cause them to slow down enough for some to deorbit and fall back to Earth. This is not just a theoretical risk - in February 2022 a solar storm led to the loss of 38 satellites, external.Orbital changes of satellites also increase the risk of collision and space weather can also play havoc with sensitive electronics on board, causing malfunctions.Radio communications can be badly impacted with GPS systems lost or disrupted for many days - so your car sat-nav could stop working, creating gridlock in cities. Image caption, A major solar storm could cause chaos for drivers relying on sat-nav to get aroundWithout GPS a plane's ability to operate safely would be compromised – meaning air travel would be big casualty too.Space weather has already been blamed for affecting aviation electronics. On 30 October 2025 a JetBlue Airlines Airbus A320 plane flying between Cancun (Mexico) and Newark (USA) suddenly and unexpectedly lost altitude, resulting in injuries to some passengers. The plane diverted to Florida with 15 passengers taken to hospital for treatment. Airbus investigated this incident and found that space weather had corrupted data in an elevator aileron computer which sends commands to the plane's flaps. In this case it caused the plane to unexpectedly pitch down. An Emergency Airworthiness Directive, external (EAD) was issued, grounding more than 6,000 planes until a software update was installed or computers upgraded. Bad as this incident was, it could have been catastrophic.The EAD states that \"in the worst-case scenario an uncommanded elevator movement may result in exceeding the aircraft's structural capability\".Image source, Bill Clarke/Getty ImagesImage caption, A JetBlue Airlines Airbus A320 landing in Washington DC.Electricity grids can also fail, causing power cuts. In March 1989 the Canadian province of Quebec was hit by a power cut caused by space weather with millions left without power and heat for nine hours. What are the chances of another Carrington event?In July 2012 a Carrington-class event narrowly missed hitting the planet. The sun rotates once every 25 days and by good luck the active area of the sun was not pointing straight at earth - so this dangerous space weather was flung harmlessly beyond Earth and out into space.And it is even possible that we could see something bigger.Researchers have discovered evidence in tree ring data from fossilised wood that suggests we could get events perhaps ten times larger than the Carrington event.Miyake events, named after the scientist who discovered them, could pose a threat to modern society on a scale that is hard to comprehend. With the last one identified around a thousand years ago, you could argue it's just a matter of time.",

    "body": "Lured by lucrative job offers and sent to fight for Russia - Kenyans want their sons back1 day agoDavid WafulaBBC Newsday, NairobiKuloba familyDavid Kuloba, seen here with a Russian fighter, thought he had secured a well-paying job as a security guardDavid Kuloba's mother warned him about going to Russia after he accepted a job as a security guard advertised by a recruitment agency in Kenya.At first the family, who live in the Kenyan capital's crowded informal settlement of Kibera had been excited when he said he had found work abroad - it sounded like a rare break.The 22-year-old had been doing casual labour in Nairobi - from selling groundnuts to construction jobs - and had long hoped to secure work in the Gulf.But when his mother asked which country he was heading to, his reply shocked her.\"He showed me his phone and said: 'Look, it's Russia,'\" Susan Kuloba told the BBC's Newsday programme. \"I told him: 'Don't you see what they show on TV about Russia? It's never good,\" she recalled.But her son insisted the offer was genuine, telling her he had been promised more than $7,000 (£5,250) on arrival - a life-changing sum for a young man with no stable income.Despite her protests, he travelled to Russia in August without telling her the exact date of his departure. She was shocked when he contacted her later, saying he had arrived and sending a photograph of himself in full combat uniform.\"He told me: 'Mum, the job we were told we came to do has been changed, but even this one is not bad,'\" she said.Kuloba familyThis is David Kuloba's military ID. He told his mother his unit was ambushed within days of arriving in Russian-controlled territory Her son explained that he and some other Kenyan men had been given two weeks of combat training - and he was heading to the battle zone in Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2022.Within days, he told her that he and others had been ambushed in an area controlled by Russian forces. She pleaded with him to come home.\"I said: 'David, please leave that place.' He told me: 'How can I leave? I signed a contract. Give me at least one year.'\"Then I received the message I feared,\" Mrs Kuloba said.It was 4 October. David had sent her a voice note saying he was about to go into battle and in case he did not survive, he wanted her to have details of his Russian military ID and contract, which was written in Russian.He urged her to take the documents to the Russian embassy if anything happened to him.That was the last time she heard from him. Confused and terrified, she sought help not long after from her son's  friend, who told her that he had heard David was dead.\"I asked his friend: 'How do you know?' He said: 'Let me give you the number of the agent who received us in Russia.'\"Mrs Kuloba messaged the number - the replies came in Russian at first. When she identified herself, the person told her in English that David was missing, feared dead.\"I'm sorry to tell you this about your son,\" the agent said.Kuloba familyDavid Kuloba, who sent his family this photo of himself in battle gear, last contacted his mother on 4 OctoberShe asked for a picture of his body, or confirmation that David was in a morgue. None came.The contact told her he was \"very far away\", and suggested that she travel to Russia herself, or send another relative, something she said the family could not afford to do.Later, the same contact told her she was \"entitled to compensation\" for her son's death but again, without providing any documentation.Mrs Kuloba says she has been unable to obtain official confirmation from the Russian authorities about David. When she visited the Russian embassy in Nairobi, officials there told her they did not \"associate with the army\".She has no idea what to do next and is beside herself with grief: \"How do we start? Because we don't know anything. He was my first-born. I depended on him.\"The father of another Kenyan man who went to work in Russia told the BBC he was recruited on the understanding that he was going to be driver - nothing to do with armed combat.The young man ended up being wounded in Ukraine and has been too traumatised to speak since returning home two weeks ago. The BBC has agreed not to identify him to protect his wellbeing.His father only discovered that his son had travelled to Russia after receiving word that he had been injured.\"He had hinted that people were going, and I discouraged him,\" the father told the BBC. \"I was following the war from the beginning. I was not comfortable.\"Agents had promised around $1,500 a month, he said - \"good money\" for a qualified driver in Kenya.His son later told him that, like David Kuloba, he had been trained for only two weeks before being sent to the battlefield.\"He said he was injured in the bush and for five days he could not find treatment. He was using painkillers,\" the father said.He was eventually taken towards the border where he received first aid and was later transferred to St Petersburg.He had described seeing \"scattered bodies of other fighters\" and explained that many like him had signed one-year contracts without fully understanding the terms, the father said.Last month, Kenya's foreign minister said some 200 Kenyans were known to be fighting for Russia and acknowledged that recruitment networks were still active.This followed the news in September that a young Kenyan athlete had been captured in Ukraine, saying he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.The government now says several recruitment agencies are under investigation, and some licences have already been suspended.\"Some agencies lure young people with promises of large payments. The government is tracking those agencies linked to this fraud,\" Sylvanus Osoro, Kenya's parliamentary majority chief whip, told the BBC.Out of about 130 registered recruitment agencies in Kenya, around five had been flagged, with three already suspended and two others under investigation, he explained.Parliament's Defence and Foreign Relations Committee had taken up the matter and the agencies it summoned were expected to outline how they had recruited young people, what information they had provided and how contracts were presented, Osoro said.But families with relatives unexpectedly fighting for Russian forces have criticised the government for its slow response, saying they feel helpless.Pressed on what was being done to repatriate those who were lured into combat roles, Osoro said the process must follow diplomatic channels.\"A contract is signed willingly, even if they were not aware,\" he said. \"It can only be handled diplomatically. Those engagements are happening.\"He said that all known cases had \"been mapped\" and that officials were verifying the circumstances under which contracts had been signed. But he declined to confirm how many Kenyans might have died.\"I wouldn't give such a report. That is not for me,\" he said. \"What I can say is that work is in progress.\"Osoro said new legislation was being drafted to tighten controls on recruitment agencies, including stricter scrutiny before licences were issued and clearer distinctions between categories of work.The issue extends beyond Kenya. The authorities in several African countries have reported cases of young people being approached with offers of lucrative jobs in Russia that later led to military recruitment.Many families are reluctant to speak publicly, fearing stigma or uncertainty about the legal implications for their relatives abroad.In South Africa, it has become a major scandal after it was alleged that a daughter of former President Jacob Zuma was involved in the recruitment process. She denies any wrongdoing.Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.Mrs Kuloba still has no official confirmation of her son's fate. She would like his body to be repatriated if he has died.\"I just feel heartbroken,\" she said. \"He wanted to help us. He thought he was going for a better job.\"Additional reporting by BBC Newsday's Maureen Nyukuri in NairobiYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "A National Guardsman is on the mend after he was critically injured in an ambush-style shooting last month in Washington DC. The parents of Andrew Wolfe, 24, say \"his head wound is slowly healing and that he's beginning to 'look more like himself'\", said West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey. The family expects the Air Force staff sergeant to be in acute care for the next two to three weeks, and they feel optimistic about his progress, Morrisey said in a statement.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of two West Virginia National Guard members shot when a gunman opened fire not far from the White House on 26 November. His colleague, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, died from her injuries. \"We continue to ask all West Virginians and Americans for their prayers!\" the governor said in his statement. Morrisey attended a vigil on Friday evening for Staff Sgt Wolfe at Musselman High School in Inwood, West Virginia, where the guardsman was once a student.A pastor at the vigil read a message from the soldier's parents, Jason and Melody Wolfe.\"We know that there is a long road to go,\" they wrote, according to local news outlet Metro News. \"But our faith keeps us hopeful. We remain grateful for the prayers and the support from people all over the world.\"Earlier in the week, the governor said Staff Sgt Wolfe had responded to a nurse with a thumbs-up and was able to move his toes.Police have charged the suspected shooter, an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, with first-degree murder and assault with intent to kill.Before coming to the US in 2021, he was once a counterterrorism soldier in a CIA-backed unit that worked with American troops in Afghanistan.Staff Sgt Wolfe was one of 2,000 National Guard members whom President Donald Trump deployed to the nation's capitol in August as part of his immigration and crime-related crackdown in Democratic-led cities. Following the shooting, Trump said he wanted another 500 National Guard troops sent to the nation's capital. The Trump administration has also cited the shooting as a reason for additional immigration crackdown measures.They have cancelled all citizenship ceremonies for immigrants from 19 countries that were part of a travel ban announced over the summer, including Afghanistan.

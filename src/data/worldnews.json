    "body": "1 day agoJerome Wirawan,in Indonesia, and Aleks PhillipsReutersMore than 50 people have been injured in explosions during Friday prayers at a mosque in Indonesia, with authorities identifying a 17-year-old student as the suspected perpetrator. The incident happened at around 12:15 local time (05:15 GMT) inside a school complex that housed the mosque in Kelapa Gading - a district in the capital, Jakarta. The victims, mostly pupils, sustained a range of injuries, including severe burns. The suspect was also hurt, according to Indonesia's police chief, Listyo Sigit Prabowo. He added that an investigation into the incident is under way, \"including how the suspect assembled and carried out the attack\". A bomb disposal team was deployed to the state-run high school complex following the explosions to collect evidence and ensure there were no other explosive devices.A pupil at the school alleged to Indonesia's government-owned news agency Antara that a homemade bomb had been brought in by a student who had often been bullied by other students.Other pupils told Indonesian news outlets that the suspect was a \"loner\" who often made drawings depicting violence, and who had been found lying on the ground following the explosion.A cook at the school described seeing white smoke coming from the mosque and broken windows after the \"massive\" blast.\"Our hearts were beating fast, we couldn't breathe,\" she told the Reuters news agency.A high-ranking Jakarta Metropolitan Police officer confirmed the presence of two objects resembling firearms at the scene.Images from Antara suggest one of the objects appeared to be a submachine gun and another looked like a pistol.The submachine gun-type object appears to be inscribed on its barrel with: \"14 words. For Agartha.\"On its body, it says: \"Brenton Tarrant. Welcome to Hell.\"Brenton Tarrant is the perpetrator of a 2019 mass shooting at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 51 and injured dozens of others.A minister who visited the scene later on Friday sought to dispel suggestions that weapons were present at the site, telling CNN Indonesia what had been pictured \"turned out to be a toy gun, not a real gun\".Lodewijk Freidrich Paulus also called on the public not to presume the explosion was a \"terrorist act\" as investigators were still combing over the scene.Another object found at the site was a dark green belt for storing gun cartridges.Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population.",

    "body": "EU forces free crew after Somali pirate attack on tanker 1 day agoRachel HaganEuropean Union Naval ForceThe Hellas Aphrodite was seized by pirates on ThursdayEuropean Union naval forces have rescued 24 sailors from a Maltese-flagged oil tanker that was attacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia.The Hellas Aphrodite, carrying petrol from India to South Africa, was seized on Thursday when armed pirates opened fire with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades before boarding the vessel. The crew locked themselves inside a fortified citadel while the attackers took control of the ship.A Spanish warship, the ESPS Victoria, operating under the EU's anti-piracy mission Operation Atalanta, reached the tanker on Friday afternoon. Special forces boarded the vessel and found all 24 crew members unharmed.\"The crew is safe and no injuries have been reported. Throughout the incident, they remained in the citadel in direct contact with Atalanta,\" the EU mission said, adding that a \"show of force\" had prompted the pirates to abandon the ship before the warship arrived.It added that the threat risk in the area \"remains critical\" as the pirates are still in the area. The rescue operation involved a helicopter, drone and surveillance aircraft. Just hours earlier, another ship in the same area was approached by a small speedboat but managed to evade it.It is the latest in a spate of attacks that have created concern about a resurgence of piracy in the area. Such activity had declined when international naval patrols and security measures were introduced after peaking more than a decade ago.However, attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea, which have been carried out for the past two years, have led vessels to be diverted through East Africa's Indian Ocean - creating new opportunities for Somali gangs.There were seven reported incidents of piracy that took place off the coast of Somalia last year, according to the International Maritime Bureau - including three hijackings. It reported only one incident of piracy in 2023. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongAFP via Getty ImagesDozens of families in Remedios T Romualde, on the island of Mindanao, are among those who have been evacuated ahead of the typhoon's arrivalThe Philippines is bracing for the arrival of another potentially devastating typhoon, less than a week after a different storm killed at least 200 people and left a trail of destruction. Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, is forecast to intensify to a super typhoon - with sustained winds of at least 185km/h (115mph) - before making landfall on the island of Luzon on Sunday evening local time at the earliest.Officials say Typhoon Fung-wong could be even stronger than its predecessor, Kalmaegi, which hit the country on Tuesday.The storm will also bring heavy rain and the risk of life-threatening storm surges, according to the Philippine meteorological service (Pagasa). Several schools have either cancelled classes on Monday or moved them online, while Philippine Airlines has cancelled a number of local flights ahead of its arrival.Typhoon Fung-wong is expected to weaken rapidly once it makes landfall but will likely remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon. Eastern parts of the Philippines have already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds, a Pagasa official said in a briefing on Saturday evening local time.While much of the country is expected to be impacted, there are particular concerns about those areas that could take a direct hit - including the small island of Catanduanes, which lies off the coast of southern Luzon.Residents there, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, have been urged to move to higher ground ahead of the storm's arrival. A civil defence spokesman said evacuations had to be carried out by Sunday morning at the latest and should not be attempted during heavy rain and strong winds. How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?Typhoon Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Watch: Cars pile up on Philippines streets after major flooding from Typhoon KalmaegiThe Philippines government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track the procurement and delivery of essential goods and services to those in need.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Typhoon Kalmaegi earlier this week has left them even more anxious about the storm to come. \"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge, I live near the shore. The winds there are now very strong, and the waves are huge.\"The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to tropical cyclones, due to its location on the Pacific Ocean where such weather systems form.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which impact the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "1 day agoLaura BickerChina correspondentChina's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third aircraft carrier, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds.Its entry into active duty marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships.  China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up.The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong.State media hailed the Fujian as a \"major milestone\" in the development of China's navy.The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian.The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea.State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: \"Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!\"",

    "body": "American delivery firms UPS and FedEx have temporarily grounded part of their fleets of cargo planes after a mid-take-off crash in Kentucky on Tuesday left at least 14 people dead.The UPS aircraft burst into flames shortly after take-off when it collided with neighbouring business premises, triggering a huge fire that gutted several buildings and closed Louisville International Airport.UPS said the decision to ground MD-11 models followed instructions from manufacturer Boeing, while rival delivery giant FedEx confirmed it would follow suit.Officials are yet to determine what caused the deadly crash.Hours before the fleet was grounded, officials confirmed the death toll had risen to 14 after another body was found, with buildings caught up in the fire still being searched for more victims.\"We pray for each of the victims' families and pray that no additional victims are lost,\" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. In a statement, UPS said the decision to ground 9% of its fleet was out of an \"abundance of caution\".Boeing later said in a statement to Reuters that it recommended UPS and FedEx suspend use of the MD-11 plane.\"This recommendation was made in an abundance of caution and we will continue coordinating with the FAA on this matter,\" a Boeing spokesperson said.It is unclear to what extent delivery services will be impacted by the moves from UPS and FedEx, which are the world's largest cargo carriers.Neither company has so far listed any active service disruptions as a result of the grounding of their MD-11 fleets.FedEx said it operated 28 MD-11s and Reuters quoted a UPS factsheet that said the firm had 27 in its fleet before the Kentucky crash.\"Contingency plans are in place to flex our integrated air and ground network to help protect time-sensitive, critical shipments such as lifesaving pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other products move through our network without disruption,\" FedEx said in a statement. UPS also said contingency plans were in place to continue its service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The BBC has contacted Western Global Airlines - another US cargo airline that also uses MD-11s. The model of aircraft involved in the crash was an MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000, while passenger service officially ended in 2014.According to the National Transportation and Safety Board, the left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off.The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulEPADonald Trump has said the US will not attend the G20 summit in South Africa over widely discredited claims that white people are being persecuted in the country. The US president said it was a \"total disgrace\" that South Africa is hosting the meeting, where leaders from the world's largest economies will gather in Johannesburg later this month. South Africa's foreign ministry described the decision by the White House as \"regrettable\". None of South Africa's political parties - including those that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general - have claimed that there is a genocide in South Africa.Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: \"It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa.\"Afrikaners (people who are descended from Dutch settlers, and also French and German immigrants) are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,\" he wrote.\"No US government official will attend as long as these human rights abuses continue.\"Trump had earlier said South Africa should not be in the G20 at all, and that he would send vice-president JD Vance, instead of attending himself. But now the White House says no US official will go.ReutersDonald Trump  confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May Every year, a different member state hosts the G20 and sets the agenda for the summit - with the US due to take its turn after South Africa.The South African foreign ministry said in a statement: \"The South African government wishes to state, for the record, that the characterisation of Afrikaners as an exclusively white group is ahistorical. \"Furthermore, the claim that this community faces persecution, is not substantiated by fact.\"Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly accused South Africa of discriminating against its white minority, including in May when when he confronted his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office. The Trump administration has given Afrikaners refugee status, stating a \"genocide\" is taking place in South Africa. Last week, the White House announced plans to cap refugee admissions at a record low, and give priority to white South Africans. South Africa's government said the claims of a white genocide is \"widely discredited and unsupported by reliable evidence\" and pointed to the \"limited uptake\" of this offer by South Africans. The claims were dismissed as \"clearly imagined\" by a South African court in February.The G20 was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis. The nations involved have more than 85% of the world's wealth and its aim was to restore economic stability.The first leaders' summit was held in 2008 in response to that year's global financial turmoil, to promote international co-operation.Now the leaders get together each year - along with representatives of the European Union and African Union - to talk about the world's economies and the issues countries are facing.",

    "body": "1 day agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Wanjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNick ThorpeBudapest, HungaryOn the surface, the Hungarian prime minister's trip was exactly what he went to Washington for: luxuriant praise and an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, gas and nuclear supplies.And all that just five months out from a difficult election.Look closer, however, and the picture is less clear cut. The US side struck a hard trade deal - and an expensive one for Hungary. And there's no progress on Viktor Orban's biggest headache: ending the war in neighbouring Ukraine, and with it the long shadow the conflict casts over Hungary.Let's look first at Orban's key win - an exemption from US sanctions, which a White House official told the BBC was time-limited to one year, although Péter Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign minister, said would be indefinite.The time span is interesting. Trump clearly wants to help his friend win the election in April. And the exemption even partially dovetails with the European Commission demand to all member states to end the import of Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuel by the end of 2027. What is missing, from an EU perspective, is any political commitment from Orban to meet that demand - a commitment made and fulfilled by the Czech government. And the EU is trying to tighten energy sanctions - to the fury of Hungary and Slovakia.Away from the media spotlight, the Hungarian energy company MOL has been upgrading two of its refineries - Százhalombatta in Hungary and the Slovnaft facility in Bratislava - to process Brent crude instead of the high-sulphur Urals crude which flows through Russian pipelines. On Friday, MOL said 80% of its oil needs could be imported through the Adria pipeline from Croatia, albeit with higher logistical costs and technical risks. So Orban's argument, which so impressed Trump, that Hungary, as a landlocked country, has no alternative to Russian oil may not strictly be true. Overall, Hungary and Slovakia have together paid Russia $13bn (£10bn) for its oil between its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the end of 2024. The one-year window granted by the US is nevertheless a valuable respite for Hungarian households this winter. Orban told pro-government reporters who travelled with him to Washington that otherwise utility bills \"could have gone up by up to three times in December\". Capping those bills by various means has been a central plank of his popularity in Hungary since 2013. Under the US exemption, Hungary can also continue to buy Russian gas through the Turkstream pipeline, which traverses the Balkans, and pay for it in hard currency ($185m in August alone) using a Bulgarian loophole. Orban has agreed to buy LNG from the US worth $600 million, according to Bloomberg.Another key part of the Washington deal is nuclear. Hungary agreed to buy US nuclear fuel rods for its Paks 1 nuclear power station (at a cost of $114m), in parallel to those bought from Russia's Rosatom and France's Framatome.Russian plans to finance and build the nuclear extension, called Paks 2, have been long delayed by technical and licensing issues. The US agreement to lift all nuclear sanctions on Hungary may help restart that project, but thorny problems remain. Hungary has also agreed to buy US technology to extend the short-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at Paks for between $100m and $200m.Perhaps the biggest part of the deal was a Hungarian commitment to buy up to 10 small modular nuclear reactors from the US, for somewhere between $10bn and $20bn. Hungary needs electricity to power the huge Chinese battery plants being built around the country. Smaller nuclear plants are less plagued by building delays, and are easier to licence.Finally, a currency swap deal - similar to a recent US-Argentina deal to prop up the peso - under which US and Hungarian central banks can exchange currency is being discussed.This would mean that in a future financial crisis in Hungary, the US central bank could feed dollars to Budapest, which boosts financial security in Hungary.So in summary, Hungary struck a deal to buy US gas, nuclear energy and unspecified weapons systems in exchange for a temporary waiver from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas. But it failed to get the re-introduction of the US visa waiver system, abolished in 2022, which harms mutual trade. And it did not get a new date for a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest as part of efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Critics say energy dependence on Russia is being replaced by energy dependence on the US. The Orban government argues it is achieving greater diversity of supply.",

    "body": "1 day agoJames WaterhouseEurope correspondentThe Belgian government has told the BBC it is urgently trying to acquire drone defences after a sighting forced its main airport near Brussels to close temporarily.Flights were paused at Zaventem airport on Thursday night, after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Defence Minister Theo Francken said. \"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Francken said several European allies have offered assistance, and he had accepted help from the German military which is providing anti-drone defences.About 3,000 passengers of Brussels Airlines were affected by the disruptions, and the carrier said it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.\"EU compensation schemes don't apply here,\" Joelle Neeb of Brussels Airlines told the BBC. \"But we do have an obligation to make sure passengers get to their final destination as soon as possible by offering refunds of alternative flights, as well as covering their hotels and transport.\"She added that drones were a \"new threat\" and as such, the airline was adapting its contingency plans.\"When our main airport is closed even for just 30 minutes, that has a big impact and we need to act fast.\"Drone sightings have caused major flight disruptions across Europe in recent months, including in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.Some officials have blamed \"hybrid warfare\" by Russia, but the Kremlin has denied it has anything to do with it.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius also alleges Moscow's involvement, suggesting these latest sightings could be linked to European Union discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.The controversial plan would see Kyiv receive a €140bn loan, but with the money being held in a Belgium-based bank, Euroclear. Brussels is nervous that it could be legally forced to pay Moscow back once the war in Ukraine ends.Belgian security services also suspect Russia, but Francken admits there is currently no accompanying evidence.In fact, amongst all the European finger pointing, there is no public proof suggesting Russia is responsible for these disruptions.Suspicions are nevertheless being fuelled by more serious airspace incursions that Moscow has recently carried out in Eastern Europe, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones.The Kremlin's likely goals are to both test European defences, as well as try to distract the bloc from supporting Ukraine, which is still on the receiving end of its invasion.Additional reporting by Bruno Boelpaep.",

    "body": "12 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Christal HayesNobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th Century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside British scientist Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology.But Watson's reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex. In a TV programme, he made claims about genes causing a difference in average IQ between black and white people.His death was confirmed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked and researched for decades, before having to resign as its chancellor over the comments.Watson shared the Nobel in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick for the DNA's double helix structure discovery.\"We have discovered the secret of life,\" they said at the time. By the early 2000s, he had been largely ostracised by the scientific community over his comments on race and gender.In 2007, the scientist told the Times newspaper that he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\", because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really\".He apologised \"unreservedly\", but nevertheless, the comments led to him losing his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.Additional comments he made in 2019 - when he once again suggested a link between race and intelligence - led to the lab stripping his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee.\"Dr Watson's statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science,\" the laboratory said in a statement at the time.DNA was discovered in 1869 but it took until 1943 for scientists to discover that it made up the genetic material in cells. Still, the structure of DNA remained a mystery. Working with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule. Maurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure. Franklin, who died in 1958, is today recognised for the integral role she played in the scientific breakthrough of DNA research, despite her work largely being written out of the story at the time.Former colleagues have commented that Watson nurtured the careers of female scientists at Harvard in the 1950s and 60s, at a time when that was not the norm. However he also made disparaging comments about women in science, and wrote sexist remarks about Franklin, including commenting on her appearance, in his 1968 best-selling book, The Double Helix.Watson became the first living Nobel laureate to sell his gold medal, fetching $4.8m (£3.6m) at an auction in 2014, saying he was letting go of it because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his controversial remarks.A Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him.James Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers.He won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15.  There, he became interested in the new technique of diffraction, in which X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures.To pursue his research into DNA structures, he went to Cambridge University in England, where he met Crick, with whom he began constructing large-scale models of possible structures.Later, after his scientific discovery, Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard, where he became professor of biology. The couple had two sons - one of whom was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, further motivating Watson's research to learn more about DNA in the hope of possibly helping him.In 1968, he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an old institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes.",

Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages and 23 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal that started on 10 October. Four of the five dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis and one is Thai.Israel has criticised Hamas for not yet returning all the bodies. Hamas says it is hard to find them under rubble.PIJ is an armed group allied with Hamas. It took part in the 7 October attack and previously held some Israeli hostages. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a campaign group, welcomed the return.\"Lior's return provides some measure of comfort to a family that has lived with agonising uncertainty and doubt for over two years,\" it said in a statement. \"We will not rest until the last hostage is brought home.\"During the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel has also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 20 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.MOHAMMED SABER/EPA/ShutterstockHamas's military wing stood guard as they searched for hostage bodies on 5 November The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel launched air strikes after accusing Hamas fighters of killing two of its soldiers on 19 October and of killing another soldier on 28 October. Hamas said it was unaware of clashes in the area of the first incident and had no connection to the second attack.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were abducted in the attack.At least 69,169 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames Landale,Diplomatic correspondent in Kyiv and Alex KleidermanAt least six people have died after Russia launched hundreds of missile and drone attacks on energy infrastructure and residential targets in Ukraine overnight.A strike on an apartment building in the city of Dnipro killed two people and wounded 12, while three died in Zaporizhzhia. In all, 25 locations across Ukraine, including the capital city Kyiv, were hit, leaving many areas without electricity and heating. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram that major energy facilities were damaged in the Poltava, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions, and work was under way to restore power. In Russia, the defence ministry said its forces had shot down 79 Ukrainian drones overnight.The Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched more than 450 exploding bomber drones and 45 missiles. Nine missiles and 406 drones were reportedly shot down.The Ukrainian Energy Ministry said there were power cuts in the Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa and Kirovohrad regions, but restoration work was ongoing.Svyrydenko said critical infrastructure facilities have already been reconnected, and water supply is being maintained using generators. Russia argues its attacks on energy targets are aimed at the Ukrainian military.Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of winter are now a familiar part of this war. But ministers in Kyiv are acutely concerned that Moscow is not just trying to damage the morale of Ukraine's people but also bring its economy to a standstill by collapsing its energy network. Analysts say this fourth winter of Russia's full scale invasion will prove a significant test of Ukraine's defensive resilience.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks showed there must be \"no exceptions\" to Western sanctions on Russian energy as a way of putting pressure on Moscow. The missile strikes came only hours after the US gave Hungary a one-year exemption from restrictions on buying oil and gas from Russia. In October, the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies, threatening sanctions on those who buy from them. But on Friday, during a visit to Washington by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - a close personal and political ally of Donald Trump - the US president  announced the exemption for Budapest.In a message on Telegram, Zelensky said the overnight attacks showed that \"pressure must be intensified\" on Russia.He said \"for every Moscow strike on energy infrastructure - aimed at harming ordinary people before winter - there must be a sanctions response targeting all Russian energy, with no exceptions\".He said Ukraine expected \"relevant decisions from the US, Europe and the G7\".Debates about sanctions can sometimes seem technical or diplomatic. But for people in Ukraine, they are very real. If Russia can sell its oil to Hungary, it can use the money earned to build more drones and missiles, like those it launched against Ukraine on Friday night.",

    "body": "Fresh deadly border clashes have broken out between Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban forces, with both sides accusing each other of breaking a fragile ceasefire.Residents fled the Afghan city of Spin Boldak overnight, which lies along the 1,600-mile (2,574 km) border the two countries share.A medical source in the nearby city of Kandahar told BBC Pashto a local hospital had received the bodies of four people. Three injuries have been reported in Pakistan.Sporadic fighting has repeatedly broken out between the two in recent months, while Afghanistan's Taliban government has also accused Pakistan of carrying out air strikes inside the country.Both sides have confirmed they exchanged fire overnight but each blamed the other for beginning the four hours of fighting. Mosharraf Zaidi, a spokesperson for Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accused the Taliban of \"unprovoked firing\".A statement continued: \"An immediate, befitting & intense response has been given by our armed forces. Pakistan remains fully alert & committed to ensuring its territorial integrity & the safety our citizens.\"Meanwhile, a Taliban spokesperson said Pakistan had \"once again initiated attacks\" and said it was forced to respond.Footage from the area showed a large number of Afghans fleeing on foot and in vehicles, with people in neighbouring towns also leaving in fear of the renewed fighting spreading. The overnight clashes came less than two months after both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey.It ended the worst fighting between Pakistan and the Taliban since the group returned to power in 2021, though tensions have remained high.The government in Islamabad has long accused Afghanistan's ruling Taliban of giving shelter to armed groups which carry out attacks in Pakistan.The Taliban government in Afghanistan denies the accusation and has accused Pakistan of blaming others for their \"own security failures\".Last week delegations from both sides met in Saudi Arabia for a fourth round of negotiations on a wider peace settlement, but did not reach an agreement.Sources familiar with the talks told BBC News that both sides had agreed to continue with the ceasefire.",

    "body": "The man accused of assassinating former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has apologised to the ex-leader's family for the first time.Tetsuya Yamagami, who earlier pleaded guilty to murder, told the court on Thursday that he felt \"deeply sorry\" towards Abe's widow, Akie.Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. He died in the hospital on the same day.Abe's death sent shockwaves around the world. He was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\".\"I have caused [the family] three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse,\" Yamagami told the court on Thursday, according to local media.He reportedly told investigators he attacked Abe because he blamed the ex-prime minister for allegedly promoting the Unification Church, which Yamagami said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.Yamagami's allegations prompted investigations into the Unification Church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings.In March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the church to disband - a ruling that the church said it would \"fight to the end\".The Unification Church has drawn controversy even before Abe's assassination, for teaching that marriage is central to spiritual salvation.Abe's grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was also Japan's prime minister, was known to have been close to the Unification Church because of its anti-communist nature. Abe himself had spoken at events related to the group.During a hearing last month, prosecutors read out a statement from Abe's widow in which she wrote: \"The sorrow of losing a husband will not be relieved.\"",

    "body": "3 days agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorWhat does the latest round of diplomacy on Ukraine tell us about Russian President Vladimir Putin's mood and intentions?For starters, that he's not ready to sign a peace deal. At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "10 hours agoBrandon Drenon,Washington DC andMadeline HalpertThe US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on whether some children born in the US have a constitutional right to citizenship.On his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump signed an order to end birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are in the country illegally, but the move was blocked by multiple lower courts.No date has been set yet for the Supreme Court arguments, and a ruling is months away.Whatever the court decides could have major implications for Trump's immigration crackdown and for what it means to be an American citizen.For nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces.The language of the amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"Trump's executive order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or are in the country on temporary visas. It is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reform the nation's immigration system and combat what they have called \"significant threats to national security and public safety\".The administration has argued the 14th Amendment clause \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the amendment excludes children of people who are not in the country permanently or lawfully.Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, told the BBC's news partner CBS that no president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,\"  Ms Wang said in a statement. \"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term,\" she added.The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.After legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal  court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.Trump then went to the Supreme Court to fight the injunctions. In a win for Trump, the court ruled in June that the injunctions issued by the lower courts exceeded their authority, though it did not address the issue of birthright citizenship itself. The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.US Solicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the amendment was adopted \"to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens\".He has said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on US soil confers citizenship and has argued that that understanding has had \"destructive consequences\"About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2016 - a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007, according to The Pew Research Center.By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.A study published in May by the thinktank Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University's Population Research Institute suggested that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the size of the unauthorized population in the US by an additional 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.",

    "body": "Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has voted to introduce voluntary military service, in a move aimed at boosting national defences after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It marks a significant shift in Germany's approach to its military and follows Chancellor Friedrich Merz's push to create Europe's strongest conventional army.The change means that all 18-year-olds in Germany will be sent a questionnaire from January 2026 asking if they are interested and willing to join the armed forces. The form will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.Students at schools across Germany have said they will join strikes in as many as 90  cities on Friday to protest against the move.Many young Germans either oppose the new law or are sceptical.\"We don't want to spend half a year of our lives locked up in barracks, being trained in drill and obedience and learning to kill,\" the organisers of the protests wrote in a statement posted on social media.\"War offers no prospects for the future and destroys our livelihoods.\"In Hamburg alone, about 1,500 people were expected to join the protests, and school head teachers warned parents not to take their children out of school for the day.German MPs voted by 323 votes to 272 to back the change, making their country the latest European country to launch some form of revised military service. Last month, France said it was introducing 10 months of voluntary military training for 18- and 19-year-olds.The government says military service will be voluntary for as long as possible, but from July 2027, all 18-year-old men will have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for possible military service.Universal medical examinations were necessary, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said, so that in the event of an attack, Germany would not waste time determining \"who is operationally capable as a homeland protector and who is not\".Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, currently have around 182,000 service personnel, and Pistorius wants to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year.The long-term aim is to raise the number by the early 2030s to 260,000, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists, to meet new Nato force targets and strengthen Germany's defences.While the plan is for voluntary service, if the security situation worsens or if too few volunteers came forward, a form of compulsory military service could be considered by the Bundestag.If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Like other European countries, Germany ran down its armed forces during the peacetime years of the 1990s. During the Cold War it had an army of almost half a million.Compulsory military service in Germany was ended in 2011 under former chancellor Angela Merkel.But now, in the face of perceived threats from Russia and heavy pressure from Germany's traditional ally, the US, Friedrich Merz has pledged to rebuild the Bundeswehr into Europe's strongest conventional army.Nato countries have come under pressure from US President Donald Trump's White House to increase their spending on defence.Incentives for voluntary service are relatively high, with a promised salary of about €2,600 a month. In France, volunteers will be paid at least €800 (£700) a month.The Bundestag was also set to vote on Friday on a contentious pensions reform bill, which will keep the state pension at current levels until 2031.The bill is a key pillar of the coalition deal between Merz's conservatives and his centre-left partner, the Social Democrats, who have just a slender governing majority of just 12 votes.However, there had been doubts about whether it would pass the parliamentary vote, as  younger members of Merz's conservatives threatened to rebel. They say the plan is financially unsustainable and will leave younger generations shouldering the burden.But Germany's opposition far-left Left party said it would abstain from voting, which means the coalition needs fewer votes to pass it and so won't have to worry about potential rebels from its own ranks.A government crisis may narrowly have been averted.",

    "body": "Western embassies in Tanzania, including the UK and France, have called on the authorities to release to the families all bodies of those killed in October's electoral violence.Citing \"credible reports\", the 17 missions said there was \"evidence of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests\" and the \"concealment of bodies\" by Tanzanian authorities during the unrest.In response, Tanzania said it had set up a commission of inquiry which would bring about an understanding of the \"unfortunate events\".Hundreds are reported to have been killed in the violence, though the government has not released an official toll.The authorities violently cracked down on widespread demonstrations after the 29 October presidential election, in which President Samia Suluhu Hassan was declared the winner with nearly 98% of the vote. Samia's main rivals were barred, prompting widespread anger over the fairness of the presidential contest, which the opposition denounced as a \"mockery of democracy\".The authorities also imposed an internet blackout and threatened anyone sharing photos from the protests.Samia has defended the fairness of the election and rejected criticism of her human rights record.At least 240 people were charged with treason after the protests, but the president later sought to ease tension and asked prosecutors to \"show leniency\". Many of those charged have reportedly already been released.Opposition leader Tundu Lissu was charged with treason in April and remains behind bars.In a joint statement on Friday, the coalition of Western embassies in Tanzania urged the government to free political prisoners and allow detainees to get legal and medical help.\"We call on the authorities to urgently release all the bodies of the dead to their families,\" added the statement issued by the European Union delegation, several EU member countries, Canada, Norway and Switzerland. They welcomed the government's decision to investigate the causes and circumstances of the violence but stressed that the probe be independent, transparent, and inclusive, involving civil society, faith-based organisations, and political stakeholders.\"We reiterate our call on the government to uphold its international commitments to protecting fundamental freedoms and the constitutional rights of all Tanzanians to access information and express themselves freely,\" they added. The statement comes amid growing diplomatic pressure on Tanzania over reported human rights abuses during the disputed election.UN human rights office spokesman Seif Magango on Friday told a press briefing in Geneva that the Tanzanian government had \"intensified a crackdown against opponents since the vote\". \"Reports indicate that since mid-November, dozens of individuals including academics, civil society actors and local political leaders have been detained, with several arrests allegedly carried out by unidentified armed personnel,\" Magango  added. He said hundreds were reportedly killed and more than 2,000 detained after demonstrations broke out following the elections.\"We call for the immediate and unconditional release of all those arbitrarily detained.\"The US government on Thursday said it was reconsidering relations with Tanzania in the wake of its heavy-hand response against protesters.The State Department said the US \"cannot overlook actions that jeopardize the safety of our citizens, or the security and stability of the region\". In a statement on Friday, the Tanzania's foreign affairs ministry said it had noted these comments but urged other countries to wait for the results of the commission of inquiry before judging.In a defiant speech on Tuesday, President Samia angrily hit out Western nations, accusing them of interfering in the country's internal affairs. defended the use of force as \"necessary\" against protesters who \"were ready to overthrow the government\".She repeated accusations that unnamed foreign actors had colluded with opposition groups to cause \"regime change,\" without providing evidence to back up the claim.Samia said her government was ready to confront protesters in fresh demonstrations planned for Tuesday next week.The 65-year-old leader came into office in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.She was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed.",

A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme, which ultimately cost the state tens of millions of dollars, according to Kayseh Magan, a former investigator in Minnesota's attorney general's office.While those accused of involvement represent a small fraction of Minnesota's large Somali population, Trump has repeatedly criticised the community, writing in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\".The House Oversight Committee said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's handling of the allegations.'Anyone who looks like me is scared' Jamal Osman, a member of the Minneapolis City Council, moved to the US when he was 14 and is a naturalised citizen. \"Anyone who looks like me [is] scared right now,\" he told CBS News.Of the fraud allegations that Trump has repeatedly referenced in his criticism of the Somali community, Osman said: \"My community is upset. Yes, people commit crimes, but an entire community should not be blamed based on what some individuals did.\"The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota.It said its enforcement operation would target those who have been issued final deportation orders. That operation began on Wednesday,  according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.Abdilatif HassanKowsar Mohamed says Trump's comments have led to increased concern\"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is already here,\" said Kowsar Mohamed, who lives in south Minneapolis. The city is home to more than 80,000 people of Somali descent.\"We're seeing boots on the ground activity where folks are just being plucked off of the streets and being asked about their residency status. That's not a data informed approach,\" she said.\"Most folks have the identification necessary, so the fear is not around proof. The fear is around mistakes happening.\"There have been numerous reports of masked federal officers detaining US citizens and other lawful residents - over 170 instances, according to a ProPublica investigation in October.Social media videos filled with images of ICE agents smashing suspect's car windows and throwing them to the ground during detainments add to immigrants' fears, whether undocumented or not.A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, denied that any people would be targeted based on race.\"Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,\" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. \"What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally.\"Local community organisations had been anticipating increased immigration enforcement, but after Trump's comments they ramped up preparations, Ms Mohamed said. One organisation, Monarca, has scheduled \"legal observer training\" in Minneapolis to educate people on their rights when witnessing federal immigration activity. Other ways the community is bracing itself, Ms Mohamed said, is by having emergency contacts ready-to-go in case of ICE encounters, and private messaging groups where people share photos of unmarked cars and masked agents.\"Everyone is just going to be in the space of caution,\" she said. \"Is there fear? Absolutely. But no one is tucking behind their tail.\" ",

    "body": "10 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesNetflix has agreed to buy the film and streaming businesses of Warner Bros Discovery for $72bn (£54bn) in a major Hollywood deal.The streaming giant emerged as the successful bidder for Warner Bros ahead of rivals Comcast and Paramount Skydance after a drawn-out battle.Warner Bros owns franchises including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, and the streaming service HBO Max.The takeover is set to create a new giant in the entertainment industry, but the deal will still have to be approved by competition authorities.Some in the film industry, including the Writers Guild of America, have criticised the deal, saying it would negatively impact workers and consumers.Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the streamer was \"highly confident\" it would receive the regulatory approval it needs and it was running \"full speed\" towards this. He said that by combining the library of Warner Bros shows and movies with the streaming platform's series such as Stranger Things, \"we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling\".\"Warner Bros have defined the last century of entertainment, and together we can define the next one,\" he said.Asked whether HBO should remain a separate streaming service, co-chief executive Greg Peters said Netflix believed the HBO brand was important for consumers, but added: \"We think it's quite early to get into the specifics of how we're going to tailor this offering for consumers.\"Netflix estimates it will find $2bn to $3bn in savings, mostly through eliminating overlaps in the support and technology areas of the businesses.Films made by Warner Bros will continue to be launched in cinemas, it said, and Warner Bros television studio will continue to be able to produce for third parties. Netflix will keep producing content exclusively for its own platform.Murray Close/Getty ImagesWarner Bros owns the rights to the Harry Potter filmsLabelling it a \"big day\" for the companies, Mr Sarandos acknowledged the acquisition may have surprised some shareholders but it was a \"rare opportunity\" to set Netflix up for success \"for decades to come\".David Zaslav, president and chief executive of Warner Bros, added the agreement would combine \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world\".\"By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come,\" he said.The cash and stock deal is worth $27.75 per Warner Bros share, with a total enterprise value - which includes the company's debts and the value of its shares - of about $82.7bn. The equity value, or cash price, is $72bn.The boards of directors from each company unanimously approved the deal.Some in the film industry have criticised the agreement.The Writers Guild of America's East and West branches issued a joint statement on Friday saying \"this merger must be blocked\".\"The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers,\" it said.  Michael O'Leary, chief executive of trade organisation Cinema United, said the merger posed \"an unprecedented threat\" to the global cinema business.\"The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,\" he said.Netflix will complete the takeover after Warner Bros finalises its previously announced plans to separate its streaming and studios division from its global networks division into two companies next year.Its global networks division will become Discovery Global and will include its cable channels such as CNN and TNT Sports in the US, as well as its Discovery and free-to-air channels in Europe. However, TNT Sports International will stay with the streaming and studios division being sold to Netflix.Hollywood shake-upPaolo Pescatore, founder and technology media and telecom analyst at PP Foresight, said the sale was \"a huge statement of intent and underlines Netflix aspirations to be a global leader in the new world order of streaming\".But he warned that while the \"surprising move\" made sense for Warner Bros, it could \"provide a headache for Netflix\" when trying to combine the companies given the size of the deal.While the agreed deal is for part of the Warner Bros business, rival Paramount had tabled a bid to buy the whole company, including its cable networks, in October. Warner Bros rejected this move before putting itself up for sale.Ahead of the announcement of the deal, Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the takeover would be approved by regulators, but if it went through it would have a massive impact on cinema.\"Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood,\" he said.Mr Harrington said there was likely to be \"big reductions\" in television and film output from a newly-merged company, which would lead to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant unions.For consumers, Mr Harrington said a merger was likely to lead to higher prices.\"Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be shuttered/become non-essential, the greater penetration of Netflix households would likely mean an increase in total overall subscription revenues.\"Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Netflix had \"offered an olive branch\" to Hollywood with the promise it would continue to release Warner Bros films on the big screen.\"If this deal can clear those significant regulatory hurdles quickly there are likely to be considerable cost savings to be made,\" she said. \"How much of those savings get passed to streaming platform subscribers or whether Netflix will be seen to have too much pricing power is one of the areas that will face a huge amount of scrutiny in the coming months.\"With additional reporting by Natalie Sherman",

    "body": "6 hours agoSakshi Venkatraman,US reporterandHarry SekulichREUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoFrank Gehry, one of the most influential architects of the last century, has died aged 96.Gehry was acclaimed for his avant garde, experimental style of architecture. His titanium-covered design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, catapulted him to fame in 1997. His breakthrough in the architectural world came years earlier when he redesigned his own home in Santa Monica, California, using materials like chain-link fencing, plywood, and corrugated steel.His death was confirmed by his chief of staff Meaghan Lloyd. He is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Leslie and Brina, as well as his wife, Berta Isabel Aguilera, and their two sons, Alejandro and Samuel.Getty ImagesThe Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, one of Gehry's most famous worksBorn in Toronto in 1929, Gehry moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to study architecture at the University of Southern California, before completing further study at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1956 and 1957.After starting his own firm, he broke from traditional architectural principles of symmetry, using unconventional geometric shapes and unfinished materials in a style now known as deconstructivism. Through blending unexpected materials and sheathing buildings in stainless steel to create curvy exteriors, Gehry created buildings that took on arresting sculptural shapes.Later in his career, Gehry used 3D modelling similar to that used by aerospace engineers to shape windy buildings, a practice largely avoided by other architects because of the complexity and costliness of construction.In 1989, at the age of 60, Gehry was awarded the industry's top accolade, the Pritzker Architecture prize, for lifetime achievement.The Pritzker jury said his work possessed a \"highly refined, sophisticated and adventurous aesthetic\".\"His designs, if compared to American music, could best be likened to Jazz, replete with improvisation and a lively unpredictable spirit,\" the panel said at the time.Gehry's international breakthrough with the Guggenheim transformed the city of Bilbao, boosting tourism to the city and the local economy. Crafted out of titanium sheets, limestone, and glass, the museum was instantly celebrated as a modern marvel.Architect Philip Johnson, Gehry's American contemporary, described the structure as \"the greatest building of our time\". Other cities tried to replicate its success, branded the \"Bilbao effect\", where investment in daring art could revitalise ailing economies.The cultural phenomenon was parodied in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, in which the fictional town of Springfield invites Gehry, who voiced himself in the cartoon TV show, to design a new concert hall. In the episode, the shape of the concert hall is jokingly inspired by a letter Gehry had scrunched up.The guest appearance later \"haunted\" Gehry, who told the Observer in 2011 that people sincerely believed his real-life designs were inspired by crumpled paper instead of complex computations.'Pushing the envelope'His work in Bilbao put him in high demand, and he went on to design iconic structures in cities all over the world: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park, the Gehry Tower in Germany, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. \"He bestowed upon Paris and upon France his greatest masterpiece,\" said Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, the worlds largest luxury goods company which owns Louis Vuitton.With a largely unpredictable style, no two of his works look the same. Prague's Dancing House, finished in 1996, looks like a glass building folding in on itself; his Hotel Marques in Spain, built in 2006, features thin sheets of wavy, multicoloured metal; his design for a business school in Sydney looks like a brown paper bag.Gehry also designed the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, layered in metal resembling sails billowing in the wind. After it opened in 2003, critics described it as a \"pile of broken crockery\", a \"fortune cookie gone berserk\" and an \"emptied waste basket\".In a 2007 interview with the New Yorker, Gehry shrugged off the concert hall's critics: \"At least they're looking!\" he quipped. Tributes are celebrating his eagerness to discard convention - and forge his own creative legacy.Paul Goldberger, author of Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry, came to know Gehry closely, and said he wanted to work \"until the day he died\".\"He was one of the very few architects of our time to engage people emotionally,\" Goldberger told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.\"He was all about pushing the envelope... wanting to use the most advanced technology to do the most adventurous things.\"In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney extended his \"deepest condolences\" to Gehry's family and the \"many admirers of his work\". He added: \"His unmistakable vision lives on in iconic buildings around the world.\"Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum posted a video tribute to Gehry.\"We will be forever grateful,\" the museum wrote on Instagram, \"his spirit and legacy will always remain connected to Bilbao\".",

    "body": "Boycotts and arguments - can the Eurovision Song Contest survive its biggest crisis?19 hours agoMark Savage,Music correspondentandIan Youngs,Culture reporterReutersThe next contest is due to be held in Vienna in May 2026 after Austrian singer JJ triumphed at this year's eventThursday marked the biggest crisis in the history of the Eurovision Song Contest.Four countries pulled out over Israel's continued participation in the competition, and more may follow.The boycott includes Ireland, which has won seven times - a tally matched only by Sweden - and five-time winner the Netherlands.Spain, one of the contest's biggest financial backers, and Slovenia, are also out.The row exposes a deep rift within the Eurovision family. And it's a situation that's been looming for years, amid festering tension over Israel's conduct during the war in Gaza.There has also been consternation over the voting and campaigning processes after Israel came top of the public vote this year - finishing second overall after the jury votes were taken into account.Israel, meanwhile, called the decision to keep it in the contest a \"victory\" over critics who had tried to silence it and spread hatred.'We argued, and we listened'Thursday's summit with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) brought the divisions within the Eurovision family to the fore.There was no direct vote on Israel's place in Eurovision, but the country's future participation was effectively tied to a ballot among broadcasters about proposed new rules for campaigning and public voting.Sixty-five per cent of members of the EBU voted in favour of that change. Ten per cent abstained.Roland Weissmann, director general of ORF, the public broadcaster in Austria, next year's host country, said there were heated discussions, but that it was a fair process.\"We argued, and we listened to the arguments of the others, and after that we made a secret vote,\" he told the BBC World Service. \"That's democracy, and the majority voted for new, stronger rules by the song contest.\"The result also meant Israel was cleared to compete - but sparked others to withdraw.According to Spain, the crisis was avoidable. \"This point should never have been reached,\" said the president of broadcaster RTVE in an angry social media post ahead of Thursday's summit.Jose Pablo Lopez said he had lost faith in Eurovision's organisers, saying they had been swayed by \"political and commercial interests\".He added that organisers should have addressed Israel's alleged manipulation of the public vote should have resulted in sanctions \"at an executive level\", instead of asking EBU members to decide on any consequences.Israel denies attempting to influence voting at the contest, and says its publicity campaigns were acceptable within Eurovision rules.More countries to boycott?Other countries who could join the boycott include Iceland, which said it would not confirm its participation until a meeting of its board next week.On Friday, Belgium and Sweden, which had been among those also considering their positions, confirmed they would stay in the contest.Finland said its attendance was conditional on Eurovision securing a \"large number\" of other participants, adding: \"The costs for participating organisations must not increase unreasonably.\"Eurovision author and academic Dean Vuletic told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday: \"The next couple of weeks are going to be tense as countries confirm whether or not they're going to participate in Eurovision next year.\"But I think we will see more boycotts.\"The deadline for countries to confirm their participation is Wednesday, 10 December.Free speech factorAmid all the drama, there's a small detail in the EBU's press release that sheds some light on why many countries were keen to keep Israel's broadcaster, Kan, in the contest.During a \"wide-ranging discussion\", it says, fellow broadcasters \"took the opportunity to stress the importance of protecting the independence of public service media and the freedom of the press to report, not least in conflict zones such as Gaza\".That's because Kan is independent of Israel's government, and has often found itself at odds with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration.\"Public broadcasters take part, not countries,\" ORF's Mr Weissmann said. \"It's not the government of Israel, it's the public broadcaster.\"Kan's association with Eurovision is believed to have protected it from threats of closure or finding cuts - because the government recognises the positive PR power of taking part in the contest.If Israel had been excluded on Thursday, there's a future in which the country's access to a free press could have been imperilled.Smaller budgetThe impact on funding will be a key question for organisers. Spain was one of the \"big five\" countries who automatically qualify for the final, due to the size of their financial contribution to the staging of the contest.In recent years that figure has been between €334,000 to €348,000, according to figures published by Spain's broadcaster, RTVE.Other countries will now have to pick up that bill – although the costs will presumably be shared between all competitors, with France, Germany, Italy and the UK taking the lion's share.And if other countries pull out, the cost for every competing nation will presumably rise.\"To lose some of your biggest financial contributors does have a huge impact, and it also has a ripple-down effect for some of the smaller countries,\" according to Jess Carniel of the University of Southern Queensland, a Eurovision scholar.\"So it does probably mean that we might have a smaller show [in 2026], unless the Austrian broadcaster can get together a bit more cash to make sure that it's still a spectacle.\"Severely woundedThat all means the competition is severely wounded, but the injuries aren't fatal... yet.Thursday was \"a very seismic day in Eurovision\" history, according to Callum Rowe from The Euro Trip podcast.Fans are \"equally up in arms and devastated at what happened\", he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"We're losing countries that have got an illustrious and storied history in the competition.\"The four boycotting countries won't change their minds before next May's contest in Vienna, Mr Rowe said.\"Whether they'll have a change of heart for 2027 is another question. If they see that Israel don't perform very well in Eurovision in 2026 they might think, oh, well, the rule changes have done what they were meant to do. But I think it's difficult to say at this point.\"Eurovision director Martin Green estimates that 35 nations will still take part next year in Vienna.The loss of four competitors is balanced by the return of three others – Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria – who have skipped the last couple of years.Not 'united by music'The row will cast a long shadow of the contest next year, and probably in future years too.With much of the music industry throwing its weight behind Palestinian causes, it may prove harder than normal to find artists willing to share the stage with Israel.The contest hasn't lived up to its slogan - \"United by music\".But Mr Weissmann insisted he didn't think the boycott would be damaging for Eurovision as it approaches its 70th anniversary in 2026.\"It was built 10 years after World War Two - united by music - and that's what is all about.\"It's a difficult situation all over the world with crisis [and] wars, and now it's our duty to keep in contact, to listen to each other, to argue - but then find democratic ways to deal with it.\"Right now, however, it's difficult to see how the ties that were cut on Thursday can be stitched back together.",

Wildlife officials said that Ms Yangchen's arrest was a major breakthrough in the battle against poaching in India. It is rare for a woman to be arrested in connection with the illegal trade of animal body parts. Police had been looking for Lachungpa for several years. She was arrested following a co-ordinated operation between the Madhya Pradesh State Tiger Strike Force and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, the environment ministry said on Friday.  It added that Lachungpa was a key member of an organised trafficking network which has links to Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan, as well having operations in several Indian cities including Delhi.Lachungpa had been arrested in 2017but disappeared after being granted bail.Another man accused at the time, Jai Tamang, and who was arrested in 2015, told police that he had given Lachungpa wildlife contraband in exchange for shelter. Tiger parts are in demand in China where they have been used in traditional medicine.The International Fund for Animal Welfare says that there were 26 documented cases of tiger poaching in 2024, with 56 cases the proceeding year. But it adds that there were likely \"many more\" tigers were likely poached as many are found dead without evidence of poaching. ",

    "body": "Oil, defence and geopolitics: Why Putin is visiting Modi in Delhi2 days agoSteve Rosenberg,Russia editor, in DelhiandVikas Pandey,India editorAFP via Getty ImagesRussia's Vladimir Putin was embraced warmly on the runway by India's Narendra ModiRussian President Vladimir Putin has arrived for a two-day visit to India, where he was embraced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of an annual summit held by both countries.Delhi and Moscow are expected to sign a number of deals during the visit, which comes months after the US increased pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil.It also comes as US President Donald Trump's administration holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to end the war.India and Russia have been close allies for decades and Putin and Modi share a warm relationship. Here's a look at why they both need each other - and what to watch for as they meet.Watch: What do India, Russia want from Putin's visit? BBC reporters discussA special friendship, trade deals and geopoliticsBy Steve RosenbergWhy are relations with India key for the Kremlin?Well, for a start, look at the numbers:a population of nearly a billion and a half.economic growth exceeding 8%. India is the world's fastest growing major economy.That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil.India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian.That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market.India was happy. Washington less so.Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying.For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems.Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers.But there's geopolitics at play, too.The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed.Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that.So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders smiling and chatting together sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a \"multi-polar world\".Russia lauds its \"no limits partnership\" with China.It is just as vocal about its \"special and privileged strategic partnership\" with India.That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union.\"I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,\" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov.\"We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy.\"But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe. Now we're not. This is a big failure and a big loss. I'm sure that part of Russia's political and entrepreneurial class is dreaming of returning to Europe and of doing business not only with China and India.\"This week, though, expect to hear about Russia-India friendship, trade deals and increased economic cooperation between Moscow and Delhi.Getty ImagesWeapon sales to India are a priority for RussiaTest of Modi's strategic autonomyBy Vikas PandeyPutin's visit to Delhi is coming at a crucial time for Modi and India's global ambitions.India-Russia ties go back to the Soviet era and have endured irrespective of the changing geopolitical landscape.Putin has arguably put more time and energy into this relationship than other Russian leaders before him.As for Modi, despite coming under intense pressure from Western governments to criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine, he maintained that dialogue was the only way to resolve the conflict.This was India's \"strategic autonomy\" at play – with Modi occupying a particular place in the geopolitical order where he held close ties with Moscow while maintaining his relationship with the West at the same time.That worked - until Trump returned to the White House. India-US ties have hit an all-time low in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock.In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here.Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his \"true friend\".But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare joint article in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine.And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe.\"For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,\" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank.Getty ImagesPresident Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India as penalty for buying Russian oilModi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia.Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades.Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct.With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade.Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing.But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets.India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix.Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible.But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin.Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance.\"Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,\" GTRI said.Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy.He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West.\"Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,\" GTRI said.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "21 hours agoEmery Makumeno,BBC Africa, Kinshasa,Samba Cyuzuzo,BBC Great Lakes,Natasha BootyandBernd Debusmann Jr,at the White HouseWatch: Leaders of Rwanda and DR of Congo sign peace deal alongside Donald TrumpThe leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace deal aimed at ending the long-running conflict in the region at a summit hosted by US President Donald Trump in Washington.However analysts have pointed out that this was just the endorsement of an agreement reached in June that has failed to end the fighting.Ahead of the summit, there were renewed clashes in resource-rich eastern DR Congo between government forces and rebels believed to be backed by Rwanda. DR Congo's army accused its rivals of attempting to \"sabotage\" the peace process, but the M23 rebels said the army had launched an offensive in breach of a ceasefire. At the start of the year, the M23 seized large parts of eastern DR Congo in an offensive that saw thousands killed and many more forced from their homes.DR Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame have frequently exchanged insults in recent years, each accusing the other of starting the conflict.At the signing ceremony on Thursday, there was no public handshake between the pair, whose body language appeared frosty throughout. But this did little to dampen the US president's rhetoric.At the beginning of the event at the newly-renamed Donald J Trump Institute of Peace, Trump said the peace ceremony was a \"great day\" for Africa and the world, later branding it \"historic\".\"I have a lot of confidence in both leaders,\" Trump added, with journalists noting he had mispronounced the names of both central African presidents. \"We'll keep these commitments. I know they're going to keep them and follow through on the agreement and create a much brighter future for the people of their countries.\"Trump got the two countries' foreign ministers to sign a peace accord in June, hailing it as a \"glorious triumph\". A number of other African leaders also attended the ceremony, including those of Kenya, Angola, Burundi and Togo, as well as the vice-president of Uganda.At the event, Kagame praised Trump as an \"even-handed\" leader who is \"never taking sides\". Rwanda's president described Trump's approach as pragmatic and said that \"as a result, we have the clearest and most viable path forward that we have ever had\".Tshisekedi expressed \"deep gratitude and clear hope\", while at the same time saying he hoped Rwanda would \"respect the letter and spirit of the deal\".The foreign ministers of Qatar and the UAE also were in attendance at this signing - which Trump has dubbed the \"Washington Accords\" - as was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. However, a day later, Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told BBC Newsday he would not commit to withdrawing troops from DR Congo, denying that any are there in the first place. \"There is nowhere in any deal that states that Rwanda should withdraw its troops, because we don't have any troops in eastern DRC,\" he said. The deal says all parties should respect national borders and sovereignty and stop supporting armed groups.UN experts say Rwanda's army is in \"de facto control of M23 operations\". Nduhungirehe also told the BBC he questioned Congolese commitment to the deal, saying it's \"something that needs to worry the world\".\"It's as if what the DRC government has signed with its right hand, it doesn't believe with its heart\", he said, accusing Kinshasa of daily aerial strikes since first agreeing to the deal in June. DR Congo has recently accused Kigali of similar violations, and the UN said Rwandan troops and M23 militia remained on the ground.The M23 was not present - it is in talks with DR Congo's government in a parallel peace process led by Qatar.The Trump administration spearheaded the talks between DR Congo and Rwanda,  hoping that resolving their differences would pave the way for the US to increase investments in the resource-rich region. At the signing ceremony, Trump said the US would send \"some of our biggest and greatest companies over to the two countries.\"\"And we're going to take out the rare earth, take out some of the assets, and pay,\" he said. \"Everybody's going to make a lot of money.\" Some analysts are sceptical about whether the deal will lead to lasting peace.A DR Congo researcher with the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies think-tank, Bram Verelst, told the BBC that there was \"currently no ceasefire in place, and the M23 rebellion continues to expand and consolidate its control\". \"The signing ceremony is unlikely to alter this situation, though there is some small hope it could increase accountability on Congolese and Rwandan leaders to honour their commitments,\" he said.The M23 seized key cities in eastern DR Congo earlier this year, including Goma and Bukavu. Fresh fighting was reported on Thursday, while on Tuesday, DR Congo army spokesman Gen Sylvain Ekenge said the rebels had launched a fresh offensive on villages in the South Kivu province. The villages are about 75km (47 miles) from Uvira city, which lies on the border with Burundi and has been the headquarters of the South Kivu regional government since the rebels seized Bukavu.For its part, the M23 said the DR Congo army had launched an air and ground assault against its positions, and this was done in cahoots with Burundian forces. Burundi has not commented on the allegation. It has several thousand troops in eastern DR Congo to support the embattled army. AFP via Getty ImagesThe main trading hub in eastern DR Congo, Goma,  has been under rebel control since JanuaryRwanda says it has adopted \"defensive measures\" in eastern DR Congo because of the threat posed by the FDLR militia group, which includes fighters who carried out the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Kagame insists that the FDLR must be disarmed, while DR Congo demands the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from its territory.Both of these conditions are included in the peace deal.However, several deals going back to the 1990s have collapsed after Rwanda accused previous Congolese government of failing to disarm the FDLR, and this remains one of the main stumbling blocks in current efforts to end the conflict.DR Congo's government has also demanded that the M23 gives up the territory it has seized, something it has so far refused to do in the Qatar-brokered talks.Qatar and the US are co-ordinating their mediation efforts. Qatar has strong ties with Rwanda, while the US is seen to be closer to DR Congo. The US State Department said in 2023 that DR Congo had an estimated $25trn (£21.2trn) in mineral reserves.This includes cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese and tantalum - key ingredients needed to make the electronic components used in computers, electric vehicles, mobile phones, wind turbines and military hardware.Prof Jason Stearns, a Canada-based political scientist specialising in the region, told the BBC that the US has been pushing for an economic agreement that could see DR Congo and Rwanda co-operate on hydro-electric power, mining and infrastructure development.\"The logic is that it will provide the peace dividend,\" he said.However, DR Congo has made it clear that while it would sign the agreement, it would not \"advance on that deal until Rwandan troops have withdrawn from eastern DR Congo\", Prof Stearns added.Additional reporting by Farouk ChothiaMore about the DR Congo conflict:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 hour agoNardine SaadandHarry SekulichSenior Ukrainian and US negotiators have jointly called on Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\" after talks in Moscow earlier this week failed to produce a breakthrough.US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's national security council, issued the call following two days of \"constructive discussions\" in Florida.They said in a statement that the prospect of ending the war in Ukraine depends on Russia's \"readiness\" to take \"steps towards de-escalation and cessation of killing\".The negotiations, which are also attended by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, will continue for a third day on Saturday. \"An end to the war and credible steps toward ceasefire and de-escalation are necessary to prevent renewed aggression,\" the statement read to mark the sixth round of discussions in two weeks.The Florida talks have seen Ukraine's team briefed on the talks between Trump's most senior overseas envoy and Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week.Witkoff spent almost five hours with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, after which the Kremlin said \"no compromise\" had been reached on the draft US peace plan. The Kremlin said Putin was ready to continue meeting the Americans \"as many times as needed\", but Ukraine and its allies in Europe have called into question the Russian leader's commitment to ending the war.On Friday, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said he wanted to \"obtain full information about what was said in Moscow and what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war\".Kyiv pushed for revisions to the US peace plan, which was widely seen as favourable to Moscow when an initial version leaked to the media. It has since undergone several changes, though a more recent version has not been shared publicly.Major points of contention remain between the two sides, including security guarantees for Ukraine post-war and territorial concessions. Russia currently controls roughly one-fifth of Ukraine's territory, including swathes of the Donbas area in the east – made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In an interview with India Today on Friday, Putin warned Ukrainian troops to withdraw fully from the region this week, saying Russia would otherwise \"liberate these [Donbas] territories by force\".Ahead of the US visit to the Kremlin, Putin was filmed in army fatigues at a Russian command post, being briefed by commanders claiming they had captured the strategic city of Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region, as well as other nearby settlements.Ukraine rejects Russia's claim that it has lost control of the city. Kyiv and its European allies believe the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato, or to provide comprehensive security guarantees. Russia is staunchly opposed, while Trump too has repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Ukraine join the military alliance.The prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a \"key question\" that was tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.Trump said those talks were \"reasonably good\", but it was too soon to say what would happen. He said it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".",

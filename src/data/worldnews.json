    "body": "3 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorEPA/ShutterstockThe fire broke out in an upper floor of a block of flats north of BarcelonaFive young people have died in a fire that broke out in a storage space in a residential block of flats in north-east Spain.Residents raised the alarm about the fire in a five-storey building in the small town of Manlleu, about 80km (50 miles) north of Barcelona, shortly after 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Monday, Catalonia's fire brigade said. Four other people were slightly hurt in the blaze.The identities of those who died is not yet known but reports said they include children and none of them lived in the building.It is not clear why they could not escape the storage room, which is on the upper floor, according to firefighters. An investigation is under way into the fire's cause.  The grandfather of one of the young victims told La Vanguardia that the boys used the storage room, which is thought to have been converted into a living space, to meet each other. No official details have been confirmed about the victim but witnesses told local media that they were all under 18, and one was as young as 12.The local authority said it was providing support to the victims and it declared three days of mourning.Catalan President Salvador Illa Roca said he was shocked by the deaths and expressed his deepest condolences to families and friends.",

    "body": "9 hours agoHarry SekulichAFP via Getty ImagesA memorial was laid out for Alex Pretti a day after he was shot deadOfficials in the US state of Minnesota say the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has refused to co-operate with their investigation into the death of Alex Pretti.US Customs and Border Protection agents shot dead the 37-year-old intensive care nurse during a protest against immigration enforcement in the city of Minneapolis on 24 January.Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) has accused the FBI of failing to hand over any information and evidence from its investigation into the shooting.BCA Supt Drew Evans called the FBI's actions \"concerning and unprecedented\". The FBI has not yet responded.Minnesota's BCA said it would \"welcome a joint investigation\" with federal officials. \"The BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,\" it said in a statement.Pretti's family has also pushed for a joint investigation, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\"Justice and accountability requires a thorough and impartial investigation to establish the facts. A truly joint state and federal investigation would be a welcome development,\" Pretti's family said in a statement.\"It remains unclear if there will be any co-operation or sharing of information related to those two shootings,\" the BCA said.State and federal officials sparred over the course of Operation Metro Surge, an immigration crackdown launched by the Trump administration.It prompted a wave of national protests opposing US President Donald Trump's migration policy and the tactics of ICE.More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual offences.Minnesota's Democrat Governor Tim Walz said the operation left the state with \"deep damage, generational trauma... and many unanswered questions\".",

    "body": "Ancient bone may prove legendary war elephant crossing of Alps19 hours agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterGetty ImagesHannibal's invasion of Europe has acquired almost mythical statusAn elephant foot bone found by archaeologists digging in southern Spain may be evidence that a troop of war elephants stomped through ancient Europe.It would be the first concrete proof of the legendary Carthaginian General Hannibal's troop of battle elephants, according to academics.Drawings of Hannibal's war against the Romans had long suggested that the beasts were used in fighting, but no hard evidence backed up the theories.Now the creatures' skeletal remains appear to have been found in an Iron Age dig near Cordoba.\"Beyond ivory, the discovery of elephant remains in European archaeological contexts is exceptionally rare,\" says the team of scientists in a paper published in Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.Often considered one of the most successful commanders of classical times, Hannibal led his army from the powerful imperial city Carthage, in modern day Tunisia, into Europe as he battled to control the Mediterranean.It is thought he took soldiers and animals from Carthage through Spain and France to invade Italy, crossing the Alps with 37 elephants in 218 BCE during the second of the so-called Punic Wars.The remains found in Spain are presumed to be from an animal that died before reaching the Alps.The archaeologists, led by Professor Rafael M. Martínez Sánchez, found the elephant's bone beneath a collapsed wall on a site called Colina de los Quemados. Martínez Sánchez et alThe top row is the Iron Age elephant bone found in SpainThey used carbon dating techniques to estimate the age of the 10cm cube-shaped bone. The result led them to believe it is from the Second Punic War.They also compared the bone of modern elephants and steppe mammoths to determine which animal it came from.The team found artillery, coins and ceramics during the excavations in 2020, providing more clues that the place was the site of a battle.\"As non-native species and the largest living terrestrial animals, these imported beasts would have required transportation by ship,\" the academics said.They say that it is very unlikely that dead animals were transported, and the bones are unattractive suggesting they were not decorative or used in craft.But the scientists say it will be very challenging to work out which species of elephant the creature was.\"While [the bone] would not represent one of the mythical specimens Hannibal took across the Alps, it could potentially embody the first known relic − so sought after by European scholars of the Modern Age − of the animals used in the Punic Roman wars for the control of the Mediterranean,\" the scientists conclude in their paper.",

I've got combat experience, that's kind of rare. I spent 25 years in the military,\" he said.He added: \"It's a serious decision. I just haven't made it yet.\"Kelly, 61, and five other lawmakers, who had all either served in the military or had roles in intelligence, have been targeted by the government after they published a 90-second video encouraging troops to disobey orders they deemed illegal. It was released at the time of rising questions of the legality regarding American strikes on alleged narco-trafficking boats off the coast of South America.But Kelly said he expected Trump to continue his legal action against him.He added: \"This is not going to end by me going away. I'm going to continue to fight this thing even if it goes all the way to the Supreme Court.\"Critics of the Trump administration have called the government's crackdown on the six lawmakers an attack on free speech and said it was another instance of the president seeking to punish those he perceives as political enemies.\"Donald Trump, is so reckless about what he says,\" he said. \"There are folks out there that, you know, react to what he said and people listen to him.\"The BBC has contacted the White House for comment.Among the other Democrats considering a presidential run are Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in 2024, and California Governor Gavin Newsom. Ina BBC interview in October, Harris said she would \"possibly\" be president one day and was confident there would be a woman in the White House in future.However, he has also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\".",

    "body": "18 hours agoCBS via Getty ImagesDuvall played mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II Robert Duvall was a distinguished and prolific screen actor who lent a brooding intensity and grizzled authority to seven decades of American film-making.Nominated for Academy Awards on seven occasions, he won best actor for his role as a troubled country singer in 1983's Tender Mercies.His many other roles included a mafia consigliere in The Godfather, a bombastic army officer in Apocalypse Now, and a Texas Ranger-turned-cattle driver in Lonesome Dove.More character actor than leading man, he could be relied upon to inject a feisty, fiery machismo and a cantankerous contrariness into the most mainstream Hollywood offering.Born Robert Selden Duvall in January 1931 in San Diego, California, Duvall was a self-proclaimed \"navy brat\" due to his father's life-long career in the United States Navy.His father expected him to follow him into the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Yet his son instead served two years in the army following his 1953 college graduation.Getty ImagesDuvall and Dustin Hoffman, pictured in 2014, studied acting together in the 1950sDuvall subsequently moved to New York to study acting, working as a postal clerk to make ends meet. His classmates included Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman, who both became lifelong friends.\"A friend is someone who many years ago offered you his last $300 when you broke your pelvis,\" he would later recall. \"A friend is Gene Hackman.\"Duvall began acting professionally at the Gateway Playhouse, a summer theatre in Long Island, where he starred in plays by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and others.His performance in Horton Foote's one-act play The Midnight Caller led the playwright to recommend him for the role of Boo Radley in the 1962 film version of To Kill a Mockingbird.By that time, Duvall had already appeared on television in such shows as Naked City, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Armstrong Circle Theatre.To Kill a Mockingbird, which Foote adapted from Harper Lee's novel, was the actor's first film role and led to appearances in such films as The Chase, Bullitt and True Grit.Getty ImagesDuvall played the reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a MockingbirdThe Rain People, released in 1969, marked his first collaboration with director Francis Ford Coppola, with whom he would go on to work in the first two Godfather films.Other significant roles around this time included the highly strung Major Burns in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and THX 1138, the eponymous protagonist of George Lucas's dystopian 1971 sci-fi debut.Duvall's performance as The Godfather's Tom Hagen, the shrewd chief advisor to Marlon Brando's ageing Don Vito Corleone, earned him his first Academy Award nomination in 1973.He reprised the role in 1974's The Godfather Part II, by which time he had collaborated with Foote again in the 1972 film of his play Tomorrow. Network, from 1976, cast him as a venal television producer.Meanwhile, there were appearances with Michael Caine in The Eagle Has Landed, Laurence Olivier in The Betsy, and Muhammad Ali in the boxer's biopic The Greatest.Getty ImagesRobert Duvall (centre) on the Apocalypse Now setIn 1979, Duvall gave perhaps his most memorable performance as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore in Coppola's Vietnam war epic Apocalypse Now.\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" his character famously declared after leading a deadly helicopter attack on a Vietnamese village.The actor was shown to no less domineering effect in The Great Santini, playing a frustrated Marine pilot who hectors and browbeats his teenage children.The scene in which he torments his son by bouncing a basketball against his head was spoofed by Mike Myers' Dr Evil in the second Austin Powers film.Duvall's work in Apocalypse Now and The Great Santini saw him nominated for Oscars in consecutive years. The former also earned him a Bafta and the first of four Golden Globe awards.Yet it was his role as alcoholic singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies that finally saw him land an Oscar, beating an all-British line-up of fellow nominees that included Caine and Albert Finney.Watch: Robert Duvall honoured in Hollywood 'hand and footprint ceremony' in 2011Duvall's other Oscar nominations came for his performances in 1997's The Apostle, 1998 legal drama A Civil Action and 2014's The Judge.In The Apostle, which he also wrote and directed, the actor played an evangelical preacher who begins a new life in Louisiana after committing a crime.In real life, Duvall attended church regularly during his childhood but was reluctant to discuss his faith, merely disclosing he had \"always been a believer\".The staunch Republican was less reticent about his political persuasions and was a guest at President George W Bush's inauguration in 2001.Duvall's other many screen roles included an LA police office in Colors, an astronaut in Deep Impact, and a Nascar crew chief in Days of Thunder alongside Tom Cruise.He was reunited with Cruise in 2012's Jack Reacher, in which Duvall played a former soldier turned gun shop owner.Yet Duvall often looked happiest when riding a horse, be it in the acclaimed TV mini-series Lonesome Dove or in the Kevin Costner Western Open Range.\"I think the Western kind of defines us,\" the actor said in 2016. \"The English have Shakespeare; the French, Moliere; the Russians have Chekhov. But the Western is ours.\"Getty ImagesDuvall was named best actor at the 1984 Academy AwardsHis other passions included football, the tango and the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, a city he professed to love \"more than any place else\".\"A young actor once asked me 'What do you do between jobs?'\" he once recalled. \"I said, 'Hobbies, hobbies and more hobbies'. It keeps you off dope.\"Duvall was married and divorced three times and is survived by his fourth wife, the Argentine actress Luciana Pedraza. He did not father any children, commenting in 2003 that it had \"never worked out\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThomas Pritzker, 75, said he had exercised \"terrible judgement\"Billionaire Thomas Pritzker says he has retired as the Hyatt Hotels chairman, after his ties with Jeffrey Epstein surfaced in the latest files released by the US Department of Justice.He said in a statement on Monday that he had exercised \"terrible judgement\" in maintaining contact with the convicted sex offender.Recently released files showed that Pritzker was in regular contact with Epstein in the years after the financier's 2008 plea deal on sex crime charges.Pritzker, who has held the role of executive chairman at the global hotel chain since 2004, said he decided to step down after discussions with fellow board members and would not stand for re-election.\"My job and responsibility is to provide good stewardship... Good stewardship includes ensuring a proper transition at Hyatt\", said Pritzker, the billionaire heir to the hotel chain's fortune.He said: \"Good stewardship also means protecting Hyatt, particularly in the context of my association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell which I deeply regret.\"Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in luring underage girls for Epstein.He was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child and died while in custody facing sex trafficking charges in 2019.Pritzker said he condemned the actions of the pair, adding: \"There is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner.\"His statement was paired with a letter to the board, in which Pritzker points out that he will be 76 this year and that the company is in a \"strong and sustainable position\" with the strength to thrive. He does not mention his links to Epstein or Maxwell in his letter to the board.The board named Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt's president and chief executive, to take over from Pritzker as chairman.Hoplamazian said Pritzker's decision \"reflects his stewardship and strong commitment\" to Hyatt over decades of service.The release of the Epstein files has revealed the financier's ties to numerous prominent figures in politics, business and academia, many of whom are facing scrutiny.There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents suggests any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, Kathy Ruemmler, announced she would leave the company after emails in the latest tranche of Epstein documents showed she had a close relationship with the financier.Ruemmler has denied having any knowledge of his criminal conduct.Brad Karp, the chairman of US law firm Paul Weiss, also stepped down in February after emails reportedly showed he discussed Epstein's 2008 conviction with him. Paul Weiss has previously said that Karp \"never witnessed or participated in any misconduct\".",

    "body": "54 minutes agoHafsa KhalilandLaura GozziState Emergency Service of Ukraine/Anadolu via Getty ImagesUkrainian firefighters respond to a strike on residential buildings in Sumy Russian and Ukrainian delegations are set to meet in Geneva for the latest round of US-brokered talks, a week before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Expectations for a breakthrough remain low, as Moscow has not wavered from its maximalist demands for Ukrainian territory.Russia's strikes on Ukraine are continuing on a nightly basis, further damaging the country's already battered power grid as subzero temperatures continue.Hours before the delegations met in Switzerland, Moscow carried out a large combined aerial attack on Ukraine, hitting 12 regions with 400 drones and almost 30 missiles. At least three people were killed. The latest attacks showed the \"extent to which Russia disregards peace efforts\", Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.Russia said its air defences had repelled more than 150 drones, while an oil refinery caught on fire after a Ukrainian drone strike.Tuesday's talks will be mediated by Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law.Ukraine will be represented by National Security Council secretary Rustem Umerov and President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff, Kyrylo Budanov. The Russian delegation includes presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky and members of the military intelligence figures.\"I don't think we should expect any news today,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, adding the talks would continue on Wednesday.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Donald Trump on Tuesday said Ukraine had \"better come to the table fast.\"The US President has previously signalled his impatience with the lack of swift progress in solving the four-year conflict. Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over large areas that territory, which Ukraine has ruled out. For Kyiv, robust security guarantees from the West must come before any proposals with Russia can be agreed.At least three energy workers were killed near the frontline city of Slovyansk in Monday's overnight attacks, Ukraine's deputy energy minister, Artem Nekrasov, announced on Telegram. A further nine people - including children - were injured across the country, Zelensky said. More than 10 residential buildings and railway infrastructure damaged.\"Russia must be held to account for its aggression,\" he wrote on X, adding: \"For peace to be real and just, action must target the sole source of this aggression\".Kyiv said 12 regions were hit, damaging infrastructure and leaving thousands without power in the southern city of Odesa. DTEK, the country's largest private energy firm, said power infrastructure in the city had suffered \"incredibly serious\" damage, adding it would take a long time to return to a working condition. Ukraine is facing an acute energy crisis after months of relentless Russian attacks on its infrastructure and as it struggles through a freezing winter. It launched its own volley of attacks on Russia overnight. Officials said a fire broke out at the Ilsky oil refinery in the southern Krasnodar region after a drone strike. A reservoir storing oil products also caught fire.The border region of Belgorod continued to come under attack, with Ukraine launching dozens of drones and causing significant damage of power infrastructure. These latest discussions follow last month's trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, which were the first three-way between Russia, Ukraine and the US since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022.They ended with no breakthrough - although the first prisoner of war exchanges in months took place shortly after.",

    "body": "17 hours agoTom BennettReutersMany have been held in Roj camp for nearly seven years, since IS lost its last territorial foothold in Syria in 2019A group of 34 Australian women and children who have been held in a camp in northern Syria for nearly seven years due to their links to the Islamic State (IS) group were released on Monday to head home, but then returned to the camp for \"technical reasons\".The group - thought by authorities to be the wives and children of IS fighters - have been stuck in Roj detention camp until now, with the Australian government refusing to officially repatriate them.It is unclear why their release was halted, but Australian media has reported it may have been due to a failure to coordinate the correct permissions between the factions governing the region. Their future - and that of thousands of other IS relatives in Syria - remains unclear. Other foreign governments have also refused to repatriate their citizens.Reuters news agency quoted a co-director of Roj camp as saying that the 34 Australians had been handed over to members of their families who had travelled to Syria for their release, and had boarded minibuses to travel to Damascus with a military escort.Australian media reported that the group were intending to continue their journey to Beirut, where they hoped to be issued passports. The Australian government has repeatedly said it would not repatriate people from Syria and said those who returned who had committed crimes would be \"met with the full force of the law\".But it has previously taken the position that it is obliged to issue passports to citizens who present themselves at an Australian embassy.Roj is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities - mainly women and children - who have been held there since IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria in 2019.Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.BBC's Orla Guerin reported from Roj camp last monthSpeaking to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the camp's director, Hakmiyeh Ibrahim said: \"My message is not only to Australia but to all countries: take your citizens, take these children and women\". She added that children were growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp.\"We brought families of ISIS-affiliated women and children here in 2017 and now it's 2026,\" she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"The Australian government said in a statement: \"Our security agencies have been monitoring - and continue to monitor - the situation in Syria to ensure they are prepared for any Australians seeking to return to Australia\".\"People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law.\"The safety of Australians and the protection of Australia's national interests remain the overriding priority.\"Last month the UK home secretary said she would \"robustly defend\" the decision to remove Shamima Begum's citizenship, according to a government source.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called for an investigation, but the government source said the decision had already been upheld by UK courts.Ms Begum was 15 when she travelled from east London to the Middle East, to a territory held by the Islamic State group, where she married a fighter.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPeter Bowes,North America correspondentandChris GrahamReutersThe talks are taking place in the Omani mission building in GenevaA second round of talks between Iran and the United States, aimed at resolving their dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme, have begun in the Swiss city of Geneva. The indirect discussions follow repeated military threats against Iran over the country's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and over its nuclear activities. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One ahead of the latest talks, US President Donald Trump said he believed Iran wanted to make a deal.The foreign ministry in Tehran, meanwhile, said it believed that the US position on the nuclear issue had moved towards \"a more realistic one\".Iran says Tuesday's meeting, mediated by Oman, will focus on its nuclear programme and the potential lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the US. Washington has previously indicated it wants to discuss other issues as well, such as Iran's missile development.Framing the talks as \"very important\", Trump said he would be \"indirectly\" involved and suggested Tehran was motivated this time to negotiate. \"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal,\" Trump said, adding that Iran learned the consequences of a tough posture in talks last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites. \"We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s,\" the US president said, referring to the stealth bombers that carried out the bombings. \"I hope they're going to be more reasonable.\"Trump's threats come amid a US military build-up in the Middle East over the past few weeks. The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, which could arrive in the region within the next three weeks.Speaking on Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded to Trump's threats of military action by saying: \"More dangerous than an aircraft carrier is the weapon that can send it to the bottom of the sea.\"He says the US's army is the strongest army in the world. The 'strongest army in the world' may sometimes receive such a blow that it cannot get back up.\"Khamenei also accused the US of attempting to predetermine the outcome of negotiations and said that would be a \"wrong and foolish thing to do\".In addition to the Abraham Lincoln's arrival, BBC Verify has also tracked an increase of US destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets in the region.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday, saying in a post on X he was in Geneva to \"achieve a fair and equitable deal\".\"What is not on the table: submission before threats,\" Araqchi said.ReutersThe US military released an image of the Lincoln carrier strike group in the Arabian Sea in FebruaryIran has responded to the US build-up with its own show of force. On Monday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran. The Strait is considered a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states. Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House said on Sunday.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Monday that reaching a deal with Tehran would be \"very difficult\".\"I think that there's an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement ... but I don't want to overstate it either,\" Rubio said during a visit to Hungary. \"It's going to be hard.\"Additional reporting by Ghoncheh Habibiazad, BBC Persian",

    "body": "5 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondent, BerlinWatch: Hillary Clinton asked about Epstein links and if Andrew should testifyHillary Clinton has accused US President Donald Trump's administration of a \"cover-up\" over its handling of files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\"Get the files out. They are slow-walking it,\" the former US secretary of state told the BBC in Berlin, where she attended the annual World Forum.The White House insisted that by releasing the files they had done \"more for the victims than Democrats ever have\".Millions of new files relating to the late sex offender Epstein were released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) earlier this month.At the time, the deputy attorney general said three million pages were not released - due to the existence of personal medical files, graphic depictions of child abuse or other material that would jeopardise investigations.When asked whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor should go before a congressional committee, Hillary Clinton said: \"I think everybody should testify who is asked to testify.\"Appearing in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing. The committee does not have the power to compel him to appear in front of them, but put pressure on the Clintons to do so, which they agreed to last month.Bill Clinton will make his appearance on 27 February and Hillary Clinton will appear the day before.A planned vote to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress for initially refusing to appear was shelved after the pair agreed to testify. It will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.Hillary Clinton reiterated the couple's call for their congressional committee hearing to be in public rather than a closed-door deposition.\"We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public,\" Hillary Clinton told the BBC.Republican committee chair James Comer had accused the Clintons of \"delay\", saying the pair \"caved\" as a contempt vote loomed.\"I just want it to be fair,\" said Hillary Clinton. \"I want everybody treated the same way.\"\"We have nothing to hide. We have called for the full release of these files repeatedly. We think sunlight is the best disinfectant.\"The former presidential candidate argued that she and her husband were being used to divert attention away from Trump.\"Look at this shiny object. We're going to have the Clintons, even Hillary Clinton, who never met the guy.\"Hillary Clinton said she had met Ghislaine Maxwell - Epstein's convicted associate -  \"on a few occasions\".Bill Clinton - who was featured in the Epstein files - was acquainted with Epstein but said he cut off contact two decades ago.Neither Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and both have denied knowledge of his sex offending at the time.The millions of new files relating to Epstein that were made public by the US justice department earlier this month after Congress passed a law requiring the agency to release material related to investigations of Epstein.Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited, without the chance of bail, his trial on sex trafficking charges. It came more than a decade after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender.Andrew, the former prince, has faced growing pressure from some US officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify before the Oversight Committee about his links to Epstein.Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability. Giuffre died by suicide in 2025.Trump - who is mentioned in the Epstein files - has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.When asked about Hillary Clinton's comments in the interview, Trump told the BBC he had nothing to hide.\"I've been exonerated. I had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. They went in hoping that they'd find it, and they found just the opposite,\" he said aboard Air Force One.\"They're getting pulled in. And that's their problem... Clinton and many other Democrats have been pulled in.\"In relation to the allegations against Trump, the DoJ has previously said: \"Some docs contain untrue and sensationalist claims against Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear the claims are unfounded and false and if they have any shred of credibility they certainly would have been weaponised against Trump already.\"The White House said: \"By releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"",

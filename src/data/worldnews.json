    "body": "2 days agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentBBCRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change. And this is not the fault of the current government or even its predecessors — it's their fault that it is so expensive, but the root cause of the problem is in Moscow.\"Top image credit: Ministry of Defence /PA Wire/ Getty Images.

    "body": "7 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterMexican lawmakers have approved a package of new tariffs, impacting hundreds of products, many of which come from China.The measures, which President Claudia Sheinbaum has said are needed to boost domestic production, were passed by the Mexican Senate on Wednesday.The levies are set to take effect on 1 January 2026 and will apply to goods like metals, cars, clothing and appliances. Dozens of countries that do not have a free trade agreement with Mexico will be affected, including Thailand, India and Indonesia.The move comes as Mexico is in negotiations with the US over steep import taxes that President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on the country.The measures will impose tariffs of up to 50% on more than 1,400 products.The levies will \"substantially harm the interests of trading partners, including China,\" said a spokesperson for Beijing's commerce ministry on Thursday.An investigation into Mexico's trade policy is in progress, they added, urging the country to \"correct\" its decision.This week, China also signalled its plans for more involvement with Latin American and Caribbean countries, as it aims to deepen its relationships in the region through trade and innovation.Chinese companies have been expanding their footprint in Mexico in recent years, with car brands like BYD and MG establishing operations in the country.But Washington has said Beijing may be using Mexico as a way to bypass US tariffs.The BBC has contacted the embassies in Mexico of Thailand, India and Indonesia for comment.Sheinbaum's government is in talks with the Trump administration as it tries to reduce tariffs that the White House has threatened to impose on the country. They include potential 50% duties on Mexican steel and aluminium.Trump has also threatened to impose extra tariffs on Mexico for various reasons, including a 25% levy as part of Washington's measures to pressure countries to do more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into America.On Monday, Trump threatened to impose a new 5% tariff on Mexico, accusing it of violating an agreement that gives American farmers access to water.\"It is very unfair to our US Farmers who deserve this much needed water,\" he posted on social media.Trump was referring to a more than 80-year-old treaty that grants the US water from Rio Grande tributaries.For decades the US has accused Mexico of not meeting the terms of the agreement.The US is Mexico's largest trading partner.",

    "body": "At least 22 people have been killed and a further 16 injured after two buildings collapsed in the Moroccan city of Fez.The two four-storey residential buildings that came down early on Wednesday morning contained eight families, state media reports, citing local officials.Several Moroccan news outlets report that the buildings - located in the south-westerly Al Massira suburb of the new part of the city - had shown signs of deterioration for several years. An investigation is now under way.Fez, in north-eastern Morocco, is one of the North African nation's oldest cities, with parts dating back to the 8th Century, as well as being its third-most populous.A search and rescue operation is ongoing to find anyone who may still be trapped under the rubble. Footage from the scene shows people and diggers sifting through the debris under the cover of darkness.In one clip, published by news site Akhbarona, a body can be seen being carried away on a stretcher by emergency services.Residents of nearby buildings have been evacuated as a preventative measure, state media reports.Those taken to hospital suffered varying injuries.The public prosecutor's office in Fez said one of the buildings had been empty but that the other had been hosting a celebration for the birth of a child when the incident occurred, state media reports.It has now opened an investigation into the cause and circumstances of the collapse, local media reports. Residents were quick to blame haphazard construction.\"People shouldn't keep building and encroaching on the next building [over],\" one of them, Abdelali, told Hespress, adding that one of the buildings had fallen onto the other.Another, Idris, said the whole incident had occurred in less than two minutes.\"It was a sudden thing,\" he told the news site. \"We were shocked, we couldn't sleep, we ran away from our homes and went outside.\"Fez was among Moroccan cities caught up in youth-led anti-government protests a few months back, with improved housing and infrastructure among demonstrators' demands.The country's housing minister Adib Ben Ibrahim said in January that around 13,700 buildings nationwide were under imminent risk of collapse.Nine were killed when a condemned building collapsed in a different neighbourhood of Fez in May.Prior to that, five people were killed when a house in the old city crumbled in February 2024, following heavy rain and strong winds.",

    "body": "11 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has launched a scheme offering fast-tracked US visas to wealthy foreigners who can pay at least $1m (£750,000).The card will give buyers a \"direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,\" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.The Trump Gold Card, which was first announced earlier this year, is a US visa awarded to those who can demonstrate they will provide a \"substantial benefit\" to the country, according to the scheme's official website.It comes as Washington intensifies its immigration crackdown, including raising work visa fees and deporting undocumented migrants.The Gold Card scheme promises US residency in \"record time\" and will require a $1m fee which is \"evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States\", the programme's website said.Businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m, along with additional fees. A \"platinum\" version of the card that offers special tax breaks will also be available soon for $5m, the website said.Extra fees to the government may be charged depending on each applicant's circumstances, the site said. Individuals are also required to pay a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee before their application is reviewed.The gold card scheme has faced criticism since it was first announced in February, with some Democrats saying that it would unfairly favour wealthy individuals.When Trump first unveiled the plan he described the visas as similar to green cards, which allow immigrants of various income levels to live and work permanently in the US. Green card holders typically become eligible for citizenship after five years.But the Gold Card is aimed specifically at \"high-level\" professionals, Trump said, emphasising, \"we want people that are productive\".\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"The scheme comes as the Trump administration has devoted significant resources to deporting immigrants.The US has also paused immigration applications by individuals from the 19 countries, mostly in Africa and in the Middle East, which are subject to the president's travel ban.The government has also halted all decisions on asylum applications and said it would review thousands of cases that were approved under the administration of President Joe Biden.In September, Trump also signed an order to charge a $100,000 fee for applicants of the H-1B visa programme for skilled foreign workers. The decision caused panic among overseas student in the US and technology firms. The White House later clarified that the fee would apply only to new applicants who are currently abroad.",

    "body": "24 hours agoMatt MurphyBBC Verify      Getty ImagesTwo US fighter jets were tracked circling the Gulf of Venezuela on Tuesday as tensions continue to escalate between the two countries.The F/A-18 Super Hornets appeared on flight tracking sites near Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city, at around 13:00 (17:00 GMT), before circling the gulf for about 40 minutes.A US defence official told the Associated Press the F/A-18 jets had conducted a \"routine training flight\" in the area.The incident comes amid a wave of US strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea, which the White House said were trafficking drugs to the US from Venezuela. Experts have raised questions over the legality of the strikes, which have killed more than 80 people.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using the strikes to destabilise the country and oust him from power.In an interview conducted with Politico the day before the jets approached Venezuela's coastline, Trump declared that Maduro's days in power were \"numbered\", and declined to comment on whether US troops could be deployed to the country.A separate jet, an EA-18G Growler, also appeared just before the F/A-18s on the tracking site FlightRadar24. Data shows the jet flew loops just north of Venezuela's coast.They are the latest in a number of unusual US air force activities that have been tracked since September. B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers previously flew up to and along the Venezuelan coast.But the F/A-18s, which are capable of engaging targets both on the ground and in the air, appear to be the first to approach the Venezuelan coastline so publicly in recent months. The F/A-18s came within 20 nautical miles of the coastline, flight tracking data showed, but the US official said the jets remained in international airspace. Neither the F/A-18s or the Growler showed a point of origin or a destination on FlightRadar24, and all three aircraft only turned on their transponders when they arrived near the Venezuelan coastline. Justin Crump, head of the risk consultancy Sibylline, suggested the move was intended to \"support the administration's signalling and put pressure on the [Venezuelan] leadership\".The F/A-18s - which operated under the callsigns RHINO11 and RHINO12 - flew six loops up and down the Gulf of Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Growler jet - flying under the codename GRIZZLY2 - also flew circles along the coast. Greg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshal and president of the Air and Space Power Association, told BBC Verify that the flights appeared to be \"probing\" Venezuelan defence and trying to check for responses such as radio traffic and encrypted signals related to defence systems.\"The Growlers would have been listening for [signals intelligence], whilst the Super Hornets would have been providing air defence cover for the Growlers,\" Baswell said. He said the Growlers would also detect \"active missile sites\".\"It could be construed as the early gathering of intelligence for subsequent operations, or just a warning of such,\" he added.Crump said the jets also had the capacity to test out \"jamming capabilities\", adding: \"This also helps send a message, when successful, potentially indicating to Venezuela's leadership that these systems cannot or should not be relied upon,\" he said.The US has deployed troops, ships and jets to the Caribbean in recent months, which officials have said is to combat drug trafficking in the area.On Tuesday the US Southern Command published photos of an F/A-18 operating from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which has been sent to the Caribbean.Analysis of satellite images and ship tracking websites by BBC Verify has made it possible to identify at least nine military vessels that have been deployed to the region over recent weeks.Satellite images also show that an airbase in Puerto Rico, which was closed in 2004 by the Pentagon, has been re-activated. Repairs have been carried out to the runway at Roosevelt Roads base and F-35s - America's most advanced fighter - have been sent to the base.",

    "body": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles and ordered the troops be returned to the state governor's control.In June, Trump sent thousands of National Guard troops to the California city in the wake of protests over his administration ramping up immigration raids in Los Angeles. US District Judge Charles Breyer said the Trump administration had not proven that that the city's protests against immigration justified taking federal control of the state's National Guard. The Trump administration still has control over 300 California National Guard troops six months after they were federalised, Judge Breyer said.Breyer also denied the Trump administration's argument that the courts should not weigh in on a president taking control of state National Guard troops during an emergency.\"The Founders designed our government to be a system of checks and balances,\" Judge Breyer wrote in his ruling. \"Defendants, however, make clear that the only check they want is a blank one.\"Judge Breyer said his order would not go into effect until 15 December, giving the Trump administration time to make its expected appeal to a higher court.\"President Trump exercised his lawful authority to deploy National Guard troops to support federal officers and assets following violent riots,\"  said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in a statement to the BBC, adding \"we look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.\"This year, Trump has sent National Guard troops to several cities, including Portland, Oregon, and Washington DC, where the deployments have also been contested in courts and, in some cases, blocked by judges.California Governor Gavin Newsom sued soon after Trump first deployed thousands of troops in June, but a court of appeals sided with the administration, saying the protests in Los Angeles justified Trump's federalisation of the National Guard.Newsom filed a new legal challenge in November, arguing the protests in the city had largely subsided and therefore the troops were no longer necessary.In a hearing in the case on Friday, lawyers for the Trump administration said the troops should stay in LA because federal immigration agents there were still being targeted.But Judge Breyer seemed to question the need for troops to remain in the city months later.\"I think experience teaches us that crises come and crises go,\" he said, according to the Associated Press.In his ruling, Judge Breyer said the Trump administration was \"effectively creating a national police force made up of state troops\" by sending California's National Guard troops to other states as well.Judge Breyer previously ruled that the way Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles this summer was illegal.All 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and several territories have their own contingent of National Guard troops.President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard to several US cities has drawn a round of legal challenges by state and local officials.Trump has argued that his use of the troops is necessary to quell violence in Democratic-controlled cities, crack down on crime and support his deportation initiatives.",

    "body": "19 hours agoAoife WalshWashingtonReutersA federal judge in New York has ruled the US Department of Justice can publicly release grand jury records from Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case. US District Judge Richard Berman's ruling reverses his previous decision to keep the material sealed. He cited a new law passed by Congress requiring the justice department to release files about Epstein.In his latest ruling, Judge Berman said the victims have the right to \"have their identity and privacy protected\", adding that their \"safety and privacy are paramount\".Esptein was charged with sex trafficking in July 2019. He died in a New York prison cell a month later while awaiting trail. Judge Berman in August had denied the justice department's request because of concerns about \"possible threats to victims' safety and privacy\".But in Wednesday's ruling, he said the materials could now be released because of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was signed into law by US President Donald Trump last month.The law requires the justice department to release investigative material related to Epstein by 19 December, including unclassified records, documents and communications.It also allows the department to withhold files that involve active criminal investigations or raise privacy concerns.Judge Berman is the third federal judge to grant similar requests from the justice department since the new law was introduced. On Tuesday, another judge made a similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating Epstein's abuse.During her trial, prosecutors argued Maxwell recruited and groomed girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year sentence. Last Friday, a judge in Florida granted a different request to unseal grand jury transcripts from another investigation into Epstein from 2005 and 2007. Getty ImagesA judge made a similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell on TuesdayThe Trump administration has faced months of pressure over the Epstein files. The president was a friend of Epstein's, but has said they fell out in the early 2000s, years before the disgraced financier was first arrested. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. During the 2024 presidential campaign, he promised to make the files public, and early in the year his administration released thousands of pages of documents from the Epstein investigation – mostly flight logs. However, justice department officials in July said in a memo no further material would be released. That prompted anger from within both parties, and lawmakers introduced a resolution forcing the files' release.Trump, who previously dismissed calls to release the files, signed the bill into law in November marking a major reversal in his position. The family of Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim who died by suicide earlier this year, said Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\".The files which must be made public this month are different to the documents released by the House Oversight Committee, which had subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier in the year.US CongressImages were recently released by a congressional committee showing Epstein's home in the US Virgin IslandsThose documents included images of Jeffrey Epstein's US Virgin Islands home, which showed several bedrooms, a room with masks on a wall and a phone with names written on speed-dial buttons.Multiple survivors have alleged that they were trafficked to and abused on the island, known as Little St James, which Epstein purchased in 1998.The images from 2020 also showed what appeared to be a dental chair, and another room that had a black chalkboard on the wall with the words \"truth\", \"deception\" and \"power\" scrawled across it. The committee's Democratic leader, Robert Garcia, said the material was released to \"ensure public transparency\".Republicans, who are in the majority on the committee, criticised Democrats for releasing selective information in advance and then released a further batch of documents.",

    "body": "The number of Indigenous people who have died in custody in Australia has hit the highest level since records began in 1980.New data from the Australian Institute of Criminology showed 33 of the 113 people who died in custody in the 12 months to June this year were Indigenous, up from 24 compared to the previous corresponding period.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, making up more than one-third of all prisoners, despite being less than four per cent of the country's population.The figures come more than three decades after a landmark inquiry into Indigenous deaths in custody which made hundreds of recommendations.Of the 33 Indigenous deaths in custody between last July and this June, 26 died while in prison custody, an increase from 18 in the previous 12-month period.One died in youth detention and all except one were male. The remaining six Indigenous deaths in custody happened in police custody, where someone has died while police were detaining or attempting to detain them.The main cause of Indigenous deaths was categorised as \"self-inflicted\" followed by \"natural causes,\" the report found. Hanging was found to be the cause in eight of the deaths.The Australian state of New South Wales recorded the highest number of Indigenous deaths in prison custody with nine, followed by Western Australia with six. Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory each had three deaths.The NSW state coroner recently described the rising number of Indigenous deaths in custody in her state as a \"profoundly distressing milestone\".In October, Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan said the upward trend was not \"mere statistics\" and the deaths needed \"independent and careful scrutiny, respect and accountability\".The average age of Indigenous deaths in custody was 45 years, and 11 of those who died were awaiting a sentence.University of Melbourne associate professor of criminal law Amanda Porter told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the figures reflected a \"national crisis\" that required \"leadership and political action\".Ms Porter, who has attended several coronial inquests with families of those that have died, said little had changed since the royal commission in 1991 that aimed to address the crisis.\"It's maddening to see the number of inquests that I attend, the number of funerals that families have to attend, and the fact that we are 30 years after the royal commission, and the situation is getting increasingly worse,\" she told the ABC.Since the royal commission, 600 Indigenous people have died in custody which includes six in youth detention, the report said.",

    "body": "At least 34 people have died and dozens more are injured after air strikes from Myanmar's military hit a hospital in the country's west on Wednesday night, according to ground sources.The hospital is located in Mrauk-U town in Rakhine state, an area controlled by the Arakan Army - one of the strongest ethnic armies fighting the country's military regime.Thousands have died and millions have been displaced since the military seized power in a coup in 2021 and triggered a civil war.In recent months, the military has intensified air strikes to take back territory from ethnic armies. It has also deployed paragliders to drop bombs on its enemies.The Myanmar military has not commented on the strikes, which come as the country prepares to vote later this month in its first election since the coup.However, pro-military accounts on Telegram claim the strikes this week were not aimed at civilians.Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told the BBC that most of the casualties were patients at the hospital.\"This is the latest vicious attack by the terrorist military targeting civilian places,\" he said, adding that the military \"must take responsibility\" for bombing civilians.The Arakan Army health department said the strike, which occurred at around 21:00 (14:30 GMT), killed 10 patients on the spot and injured many others.Photos believed to be from the scene have been circulating on social media showing missing roofs across parts of the building complex, broken hospital beds and debris strewn across the ground.The junta has been locked in a years-long bloody conflict with ethnic militias, at one point losing control of more than half the country.But recent influx of technology and equipment from China and Russia seems to have helped it turn the tide. The junta has made significant gains through a campaign of airstrikes and heavy bombardment. Earlier this year, more than 20 people were killed after an army motorised paraglider dropped two bombs on a crowd protesting at a religious festival.Civil liberties have also shrunk dramatically under the junta. Tens of thousands of political dissidents have been arrested, rights groups estimate.Myanmar's junta has called for a general election on 28 December, touting it as a pathway to political stability. But critics say the election will be neither free nor fair, but will instead offer the junta a guise of legitimacy. Tom Andrews, the United Nations' human rights expert on Myanmar, has called it a \"sham election\".In recent weeks the junta has arrested civilians accused of disrupting the vote, including one man who authorities said had sent out anti-election messages on Facebook.The junta also said on Monday that it was looking for 10 activists involved in an anti-election protest.Ethnic armies and other opposition groups have pledged to boycott the polls.At least one election candidate in in central Myanmar's Magway Region was detained by an anti-junta group, the Associated Press reported.",

    "body": "3 days agoKatya AdlerBBC Europe editorUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has met key European allies as he faces US pressure to reach a swift peace deal with Russia.In London, Zelensky held talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.The meeting came amid US efforts to get Moscow and Kyiv to sign up - quickly - to a plan to end the war in Ukraine.For Kyiv, the crucial, thorny issues are the question of ceding territory to Russia as part of any peace deal and obtaining strong security guarantees to ensure that Moscow respects an eventual agreement.Ahead of the meeting in London, Starmer insisted - as he often has in the past - that Ukraine needed \"hard-edged security guarantees\". He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv must determine its own future, not have conditions imposed on it.The big names Starmer hosted in London discussed hugely significant issues - not only for Ukraine's future, but for the security of the continent as a whole.There's concern that if Russia is \"rewarded\" by being given Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, it could feel emboldened to attack other European countries in the future.But will Monday's talks in London make any meaningful difference to peace negotiations?The visuals of Europe's arguably most influential nations standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street tell one story. But when it comes to Washington, European leaders are walking a tightrope.In its National Security Strategy published on Friday, the US pointed the finger of blame at Europeans over Ukraine, accusing them of having \"unrealistic expectations\" as to how the war might end.Although they have not publicly commented on the document, behind closed doors Europe's leaders fear Donald Trump is keen for a quick fix in Ukraine, so he can turn his attentions elsewhere. But a quick fix, they worry, will not mean a long-lasting peace - only a temporary pause in Russian aggression in Ukraine and possibly further afield in Europe.Recent incidents including unmanned drones causing chaos in civilian airports in Germany, Denmark, Belgium and elsewhere, an act of railway sabotage in Poland that could have cost lives and significant cyber-attacks across the continent have all been laid at Russia's door. They have brought the war in Ukraine closer to Europeans, however far they are from the front line. With that has come a sense that Russia would like to weaken their continent as a whole.But we do not hear those European concerns broadcast loudly in public.For the most part, leaders continue to praise Trump. On Monday, Starmer said the US president had progressed peace negotiations \"the furthest we've got in the four years\" in just a few weeks. He added that talks were complicated, but progress was being made.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that he was \"sceptical about some of the details which we are seeing in the documents coming from the US side\",  but added \"we have to talk about it\".The fact is, European leaders don't want to provoke the US president over differences on how to achieve peace.Donald Trump has flip-flopped dramatically in his attitudes towards Kyiv since he returned to the White House. He has a pretty tempestuous relationship with Volodymyr Zelensky, whereas he has often praised Vladimir Putin.Washington has already stopped direct aid to Ukraine - although it still provides much-needed intelligence to its military and allows European countries to purchase US weapons which are then sent on to Kyiv.European nations are not in a position to support Ukraine militarily without the US.After decades of under-investment in their militaries, they are not in a position to take on the security and defence of their own continent alone, either.The US is the biggest and most powerful member of Nato. Europe looks to Washington for intelligence, command and control capabilities, for air force capabilities - such as air-to-air refuelling - and much more.Despite a pledge to Donald Trump at a Nato summit a few months ago to vastly increase defence spending (and Trump is far from the first US president to ask for that), Europe cannot practically become militarily independent overnight.European governments are currently facing considerable budgetary constraints.In the UK, talk of struggling and failing public services is common. In France - which has long been in the throes of a huge budgetary crisis - next year's draft budget only sets €120m (£105m) in civilian and military aid for Ukraine.It is because of these limitations that - in public - the concerns about Washington and a peace plan for Ukraine are so carefully expressed by Europe's leaders. They don't want to risk being left completely alone by the power they still describe as their greatest ally.But the differences in the European and US approaches to Moscow are glaring.While Europeans – particularly in countries bordering Russia - view Moscow as a destabilising threat, in its National Security Strategy the Trump administration talked up the importance of building \"strategic stability\" with Russia, and questioned Europe's longer-term reliability as an ally.Europe's leaders are trying to avoid further alienating the US president, while fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty and future continental stability. It's a tortuous dance.",

On that basis, first and foremost, we are stepping back while the situation is as it is.\"RÚV said Israel's participation had \"created disunity among both members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the general public\".The broadcaster's board agreed the decision at a meeting on Wednesday, hours before the deadline for countries to confirm whether they will join what's supposed to be a celebratory 70th anniversary edition of the song contest next May.Iceland was believed to be the last remaining country to announce its decision.Eurovision director Martin Green said: \"We respect the decision of all broadcasters who have chosen not to participate in next year's Eurovision Song Contest and hope to welcome them back soon.\"ReutersThe next contest is due to be held in Vienna in May 2026 after Austrian singer JJ triumphed at this year's eventIsrael's presence at Eurovision has been an increasing source of tension, because of the war in Gaza and concerns about the voting and campaigning processes, including accusations that Israel's government tried to influence the public vote at this year's event.A new raft of measures designed to protect the integrity of the vote was approved at an EBU summit last week, after which most countries confirmed they would travel to Vienna for the 2026 contest.The Icelandic broadcaster's board had previously approved a recommendation to ask the EBU to ban Israel from Eurovision 2026.Iceland was reportedly among seven countries that then requsted a vote at the EBU general meeting on Israel's participation.That request was denied, and Israel's future participation was instead effectively tied to a ballot on the new voting and campaigning rules.The Icelandic broadcaster said that while the new measures addressed many of its concerns, it \"believes that there are still doubts whether the agreed adjustments would be fully satisfactory\".\"RÚV has repeadly raised concerns that various Icelandic stakeholders, such as artist associations and the general public, were opposed to participation in the contest.\"Furthermore, RÚV had requested the EBU to exclude [Israeli public broadcaster] KAN from the contest in accordance to precedents.\"It is a complex matter which has already damaged the contest's reputation and EBU, emphasizing the necessity of a solution for all concerned parties.\"EPAIsrael's Yuval Raphael topped the public vote at Eurovision 2025 and finished second overall after jury scores were includedAccording to a transcript of Thursday's meeting supplied by KAN, the broadcaster's chief executive Golan Yochpaz criticised those trying to get Israel thrown out.\"The attempt to remove KAN from the contest can only be understood as a cultural boycott,\" he said. \"A boycott may begin today with Israel, but no one knows where it will end or who else it may harm.\"Is this what we truly want this contest to be remembered for on its 70th anniversary?\"Israel has taken part in Eurovision since 1973 because KAN, its public broadcaster, is a member of the EBU, which organises the competition.Israel has won four times, most recently in 2018, and came second in the 2025 contest.Iceland has never won but came second in 1999 and 2009.Poland 'giving Eurovision a chance'Meanwhile, Poland confirmed on Wednesday that it will take part in next year's contest.\"We are aware of the scale of tensions surrounding the upcoming edition. We understand the emotions and concerns,\" broadcaster TVP said.\"However, we believe that Eurovision still has a chance to once again become a space filled with music - and only music.\"We are giving it that chance, just as the vast majority of EBU members are.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoJaroslav LukivandChris Mason,Political editorEuropean leaders have said \"intensive work\" will continue in the coming days on a US-led plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, after a joint phone call with President Donald Trump.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said they \"agreed that this was a critical moment - for Ukraine, its people and for shared security across the Euro-Atlantic region\".Trump later said \"we discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words\", admitting that there were \"some little disputes about people\". The joint call comes the day after Trump called European leaders \"weak\", suggesting the US could scale back support for Ukraine. In the wide-ranging Politico interview published on Tuesday, Trump also claimed Ukraine was \"using war\" to avoid holding elections, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to reply he was \"ready\" for them.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.The three European leaders issued identical statements shortly after their call with Trump on Wednesday.They read: \"The leaders discussed the latest on the ongoing US-led peace talks, welcoming their efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace for Ukraine, and to see an end to the killing.\"Intensive work on the peace plan is continuing and will continue in the coming days.\"The call lasted for about 45 minutes, and was initiated by the Americans last night.Sources characterise progress as \"inching towards a deal\" - but emphasise the complexity of arriving at one.A key sticking point remains Ukrainian territory and whether it is viable or reasonable to expect Kyiv to effectively give up land regarded as its own.The longstanding formulation of the British government is that decisions about Ukraine have to be made by Ukraine.This is an argument European governments are making to Washington, while publicly and privately praising Trump's commitment to bringing an end to the war.National Security Advisers from around Europe, including the UK's Jonathan Powell, are meeting regularly with Ukrainian officials. Summaries of those conversations and others are then shared by allies with Washington.It is expected that were a point to be reached where a potential deal was arrived at, America would then lead a conversation with Moscow.At a White House briefing later on Wednesday, Trump admitted that \"strong words\" were used during the phone call.He said he was yet to decide on whether to agree with European proposals to hold more meetings this weekend involving Washington and Kyiv.\"We don't want to be wasting time,\" the US president said.He also called on Zelensky to be \"realistic\", saying that Ukrainians \"want a settlement... they wanna see it [the war] end\".Earlier on Wednesday, Zelensky wrote on social media that a 20-point document on how to end the war would be handed over to the US in \"the near future\" after \"our joint work with President Trump's team and partners in Europe\".The Ukrainian leader provided no further details.The original US draft peace plan - widely leaked to media last month - had 28 points, and was seen as favouring Russia. Ukraine has since held separate talks with US and European negotiators, seeking to change some key clauses such as territorial issues and security guarantees.Zelensky is under increasing pressure from Trump to agree to a peace deal to end the war, with the US president urging Kyiv to \"play ball\" by ceding territory to Moscow.Zelensky has repeatedly refused to do so, seeking instead an immediate ceasefire on the vast front line and iron-clad security guarantees for Kyiv in any future settlement.The Ukrainian leader is on a diplomatic tour of Europe following intensive talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators over the weekend which failed to produce a deal to which Kyiv could agree.Zelensky has been pressing his European allies to help deter the US from backing an agreement that could leave Ukraine exposed to future attacks by Russia. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said Trump's \"very important\" statements on Ukraine, including saying Moscow would win the war and that Kyiv would need to hand over land, align with Russia's view.\"In many ways, on the subject of Nato membership, on the subject of territories, on the subjects of how Ukraine is losing land, it is in tune with our understanding,\" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Last week, Putin repeated his warning that Ukrainian troops must completely withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war.In recent weeks Russian troops have continued their slow advance in south-eastern Ukraine - despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "23 hours agoMahfouz Zubaide,Afghanistan producerandMattea BubaloFour Afghan men were ordered to report to the Taliban government's department of vice and virtue for dressing in costumes inspired by the TV series Peaky Blinders.The friends were told that their clothing was \"in conflict with Afghan and Islamic values\", a Taliban spokesman told the BBC, adding the values in Peaky Blinders went against Afghan culture.In videos posted online, the men, who have been released, can be seen posing in flat caps and three-piece suits similar to those worn in the series set in England soon after World War One.Since the Taliban seized power in 2021, they have imposed a number of restrictions on daily life in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.\"Even jeans would have been acceptable, but the values in the Peaky Blinders series are against Afghan culture,\" Saiful Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Taliban government's provincial department of Vice and Virtue in Herat city told the BBC.The men, all in their early twenties, come from the town of Jibrail in Herat province. They were ordered to report to the Taliban's \"morality police\" on Sunday, and presented themselves for questioning in Herat the following day.\"They were promoting foreign culture and imitating film actors in Herat,\" Khyber wrote on social media, adding that they had undergone a \"rehabilitation programme\". They were not formally arrested, \"only summoned and advised and released\", Khyber told the BBC's US partner CBS News.\"We have our own religious and cultural values, and especially for clothing we have specific traditional styles,\" he said.\"The clothing they wore has no Afghan identity at all and does not match our culture. Secondly, their actions were an imitation of actors from a British movie. Our society is Muslim; if we are to follow or imitate someone, we should follow our righteous religious predecessors in good and lawful matters.\"The men could be seen thanking officials for their advice and saying they were unaware they had violated any laws in a video released by the ministry after they were questioned - though it is unclear under what circumstances the interview was recorded. \"I have innocently been sharing content that was against Sharia which had many viewers,\" one said in the recording.He said he had been \"summoned and advised\", and would no longer do \"anything like this\".In an interview with YouTube channel Herat-Mic uploaded at the end of November, before they were summoned, the friends said they admired the fashion displayed in the series, adding that they had received positive reactions from locals.\"At first we were hesitant, but once we went outside, people liked our style, stopped us in the streets, and wanted to take photos with us,\" one of the men said, according to a translation by CBS News.",

    "body": "Big tech bets big on AI - but can India keep pace in the global race?10 hours agoNikhil InamdarNurPhoto via Getty Images)India is a hedge against the global AI bubble, some experts sayThis week, tech giants Amazon and Microsoft pledged an eye-popping $50bn-plus combined investment in India, putting artificial intelligence (AI) in the spotlight.Microsoft's Satya Nadella announced his company's largest investment ever in Asia - $17.5bn (£13.14bn) - \"to help build the infrastructure, skills, and sovereign capabilities needed for India's AI-first future\". Amazon followed suit, and said it was putting in more than $35bn in the country by 2030, with an unspecified chunk of that investment going into boosting AI capabilities. The announcements come at a particularly interesting juncture. As fears of an AI bubble swept global markets and tech stock valuations soared, several leading brokerages took a contrarian view on India's AI landscape.Christopher Wood of Jefferies said the country's stocks were a \"reverse AI trade\". That basically means India should outperform other markets in the world \"if the AI trade suddenly unwinds\" - or simply put, the global bubble bursts.HSBC also held a similar view, saying Indian equities offered a \"hedge and diversification\" for those uneasy with the ongoing AI rally. This comes as Mumbai stocks have lagged behind their Asian peers over the past year, with foreign investors moving billions into Korean and Taiwanese AI-driven tech companies in the absence of comparable opportunities in India.In this backdrop, the Amazon and Microsoft investments provide a much-needed fillip - yet it remains worth asking where India truly stands in the global AI race.AFP via Getty ImagesIndia ranks among the top globally in terms of AI talent and developer activityThere are no easy answers.The adoption of AI in India has been rapid. Investments into some parts of the value chain - such as data centres, the physical backbone of AI, or chip-making facilities - have begun trickling in. Just this week, American chipmaker Intel announced a collaboration with Mumbai-based Tata Electronics to manufacture chips locally. But when it comes to a sovereign AI model, it appears India is continuing to play catch-up.About a year-and-a-half ago, the Indian government launched an AI mission through which it began supplying start-ups, universities and researchers with high-end computing chips to develop a large homegrown AI model like OpenAI or China's DeepSeek.According to the federal electronics ministry, the launch of the sovereign model  - which supports more than 22 languages - is imminent. In the interim though, the likes of DeepSeek and OpenAI have made further advances, launching newer variants. While the government has recognised the need to reduce over-dependence on foreign platforms because of the risk of surveillance and sanctions, India's $1.25bn sovereign mission is a shadow of France's $117bn or Saudi Arabia's $100bn programmes. The country's ambitions also face numerous other hurdles - from semiconductor availability to skilled talent and fragmented data ecosystems, according to global consultancy EY. India currently lacks enough computational infrastructure or the billions of dollars of research and development (R&D) investment made over decades that gave China and the US a distinct leg up.Despite its global strength in AI talent, India struggles to keep its developers at home.\"The current tightening of overseas work visas provides India a window of opportunity to retain domestic talent and attract Indian-origin talent at home. However, given that top-tier AI talent is mobile globally, attractive policy incentives need to be put in place to incentivise relocation to India,\" the EY report says.China, for example, offers a range of incentives such as \"financial support and subsidies, tax incentives and funding for research and development, special talent visas and fast-track immigration\", the report says.India has a much higher concentration of AI-skilled professionals than the global average - specifically, 2.5 times more. Policies that retain this talent are not yet in place.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesIndia has been attracting billions of dollars of investments into data centres Yet, despite the challenges, India - along with countries like Brazil and the Philippines - punches above its weight in AI, especially in the context of its stage of economic development, an UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) study said. According to the widely tracked Stanford AI Index 2025, the country ranks among the top five in the world on new companies receiving AI investments.Last year, 74 new Indian AI startups received funding - a fraction of the more than 1,000  funded in the US.Indian AI startups raised just $1.16bn privately, compared with over $100bn in the US and nearly $10bn in China.But there's enough intellectual engagement with AI in India, with the country accounting for 9.2% of AI article publications - slightly more than the US, but behind Europe and China according to the Stanford AI Index.Experts say India's AI edge may lie less in building costly language models and more in using them downstream to spur entrepreneurship.\"I think in the short term, there's this big concentration of AI in the US. But over the next five-10 years, AI will have a massively democratising effect on the creation of new companies. Small founders and entrepreneurs will be numerous and the downstream effect will be amazing for places like India and the Asia-Pacific,\" Shailendra Singh, managing director of Peak XV Partners which invests in AI start-ups, told the BBC.Mr Singh says India is seeing a surge in AI-powered consumer apps, with AI startup investments doubling from last year.Moreover, many Indian startups are now using AI to tackle real-world challenges for millions still on the wrong side of the digital divide.For example, MahaVISTAAR, an AI app run by the Maharashtra government, delivers vital agricultural information in the local Marathi language, reaching over 15 million farmers.\"The hardest places to make artificial intelligence work are also the places where it matters most. If AI can serve India's classrooms, clinics and farms, it can serve the world,\" Nandan Nilekani, the architect of India's biometric programme, wrote in The Economist magazine last month. Some of that has already begun to happen, as apps like MahaVISTAAR and others have shown. AI brings new opportunities, but could disrupt India's IT services sector, which has driven its economy and created millions of jobs over the past 30 years.As AI upends some of their business functions, India's billion-dollar IT firms will become a key area of \"vulnerability\", according to Jefferies.That vulnerability is already showing. Growth in India's IT back offices is slowing, stocks are underperforming, hiring has shrunk and wages have stagnated as the spectre of a new disruptor looms large.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "A Japanese chess association has apologised to a prominent shogi player who criticised a rule that bars pregnant players from title matches around their expected due dates.Under the current rules of shogi - a game similar to chess - such players are replaced, meaning they forfeit all competitions and potential titles during that time.Kana Fukuma, one of Japan's most decorated shogi players, says this forces players to choose between having a child and developing their careers, and \"significantly restricts reproductive rights\".\"I hope the body will consider allowing female players to take time off before their due dates without suffering demotion,\" she told a news conference on Wednesday.Current rules stipulate that a pregnant women cannot compete within a 14-week period - from six weeks before they give birth, to eight weeks after.\"I hesitated to have a child while pursuing my career in shogi, which is everything to me,\" Ms Fukuma said, according to Japan's Kyodo News. The 33-year-old has been playing the popular Japanese board game professionally since 2003. Before giving birth to her first child in December 2024, however, Ms Fukuma was forced to withdraw from several tournaments due to health issues related to her pregnancy.In a written request submitted on Tuesday, Ms Fukuma urged the association to adjust match dates or venues to accommodate pregnant players, allow competition during pregnancy if the woman's condition allows for it, and ensure women are not stripped of titles during their maternity leave, Kyodo News reported.The association said it could revise the rules after \"discussions with experts while considering the safety of the mother and the fairness of title matches\". This exchange between Ms Fukuma and the shogi association drew mixed responses on social media, with some calling the current rules \"misogynistic\" and others drawing comparisons to professional sports tournaments.On Reddit, one user pointed out that tennis players are sometimes given \"protected rankings\", which allow those returning from long injuries or maternity leave to use their previous rankings to enter major tournaments, including the Grand Slam.",

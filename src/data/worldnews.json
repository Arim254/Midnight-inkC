    "body": "Nine people have been killed and dozens more wounded in a Russian attack on the western city of Ternopil, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has said. Nine-storey blocks of flats were hit in the strikes, as Russia fired more than 470 drones and 47 missiles at Ukraine overnight in a \"brazen attack\", Zelensky said.Three districts of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, were also hit by a massive drone attack which injured more than 30 people, including children. Photos posted online showed buildings and cars ablaze. Power cuts are affecting a number of regions across the country, Ukraine's energy ministry said.The attack early on Wednesday was one of the deadliest on western Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.Zelensky said there had been \"significant destruction\" in Ternopil, adding that people could be trapped under the rubble. Energy facilities, transport and civil infrastructure were damaged elsewhere in western Ukraine.The energy sector in Ivano-Frankivsk region was also attacked, and two of the three injured were children. Critical infrastructure and energy were hit in the Lviv region, Zelensky said, while the head of the region said a energy facility had been struck. Zelensky, who is in Turkey for talks with his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called for aid from Ukraine's allies, writing: \"Every brazen attack against ordinary life shows that the pressure on Russia is insufficient. Effective sanctions and assistance to Ukraine can change this.\" Ukraine's president had said he wanted to \"intensify\" peace negotiations ahead of the meeting in Ankara, but the Kremlin said no Russian representative would join.

    "body": "10 hours agoSam Hancock and Hugo Bachega,Middle East correspondent  ReutersAt least 13 people have been killed in an Israeli strike near a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, the country's health ministry says.The Israeli military said it had targeted members of the Palestinian armed group Hamas \"operating in a training compound... in the Ein el-Hilweh area\". It said the location was used by Hamas to plan and carry out attacks against Israel, which Hamas rejected as \"fabrication and lies\".Israel has carried out regular air strikes on people and places in Lebanon since a deal to end the conflict with the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Most strikes have targeted Hezbollah but Israel has also attacked Hamas in the country.As well as those killed, Lebanon's health ministry said at least four people had been injured in the strike.Images showed emergency workers at the entrance of Ein el-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon.Footage online also showed ambulances rushing through the narrow streets of the crowded camp as a huge plume of smoke billowed from the location hit.Initial reports said the strike hit an area outside a mosque that is usually busy at night. Condemning the attack, Hamas said it had \"no military installations in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon\" and that the site targeted was an \"open sports field\".In its statement, the IDF said \"prior to the strike, measures were taken to reduce the chance of harm to civilians, including the use of precision munitions, aerial observations, and additional intelligence information\".Hamas attacked southern Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel's military response has killed at least 69,169 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after the Lebanese group fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Israel and Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months that culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October 2024.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.",

    "body": "Nearly every Republican in the US House of Representatives voted on a bill  to compel the release of documents tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The lone \"nay\" came from the Republican lawmaker from Louisiana, Clay Higgins, who defied his party saying his vote was a principled \"NO\".\"What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,\" Higgins wrote on X. \"It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\"The resounding vote in favour of the Epstein bill, 427-1, marks a rare moment of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Hours later, the US senate too approved the legislation, clearing the way for the final act - President Donald Trump's signature. For Higgins, safeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was the primary issue with the legislation.\"As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,\" he wrote on X. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.\"  Higgins said he would support the bill if it were to be amended by the Senate, which Republican majority leader John Thune had already suggested was unlikely. \"When a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1 and the president said he's going to sign it, I'm not sure that amending it is in the cards,\" Thune said before the Senate's unanimous approval for the bill on Tuesday.Prior to the House passing the legislation, only four Republicans had joined all Democrats in signing a petition to force a vote - Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene.But it achieved overwhelming Republican support after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote.Higgins has represented Louisiana's third district since 2017 and is widely regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress, according to his website.His holdout vote in the wake of 200-plus members of his party voting otherwise is not the first time he has taken an unorthodox stance.In 2024, House Republicans voted to censure Higgins for offensive remarks he made on social media after he called Haiti \"the nastiest country in the western hemisphere\" and referred to Haitians as \"eating pets\" and \"slapstick gangsters\". \"All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,\" Higgins wrote.Facebook removed two posts from Higgins in 2020, after he wrote he would \"drop any 10 of you where you stand\", referring to any armed protesters that might attend a Louisiana demonstration against police brutality.Facebook told Business Insider at the time the posts \"were removed for violating our policies against inciting violence\". Before Congress, Higgins was a member of Louisiana's St Landry's Parish Sheriff's Office. He resigned in 2016 amid backlash about a controversial anti-crime video where he was seen holding a rifle and making threats against gang members. The BBC has contacted Higgins's office for comment.

    "body": "Superstar footballer Cristiano Ronaldo attended a White House black-tie dinner alongside the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia on Tuesday night.Speaking ahead of the event, US President Donald Trump said it was an \"honour\" to host Ronaldo, whose starring role in the Saudi football league has seen him become a face of the country's modernisation drive.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman wants to reduce the country's dependence on oil revenues by diversifying into other areas including sports and tourism. A White House official confirmed earlier in the day that Ronaldo would attend, but did not say if he was part of bin Salman's official delegation.Many critics claim Saudi's investment is aimed at gaining legitimacy and deflecting attention from its human rights record and the environmental impact of its oil industry - a practice referred to as 'sportswashing'.Trump used his speech at the dinner to praise closer ties with Saudi Arabia, labelling the country a \"major non-Nato ally\". Earlier in the day, Trump hosted the Saudi crown prince in the Oval Office. Turning to the Portuguese soccer star, Trump told the gathered guests: \"My son is a big fan of Ronaldo\".\"And Baron (Trump) got to meet him, and I think he respects his father a little bit more now, just the fact that I introduced you.\"Also at the dinner was tech billionaire Elon Musk, who joined other influential business leaders including Apple CEO Tim Cook. It is the first time Musk has been  to the White House since stepping down as the head of the Trump administration's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) in April.A dramatic feud between Trump and the Tesla tycoon played out publicly for months, and included Musk announcing that he would set up a new political party.Ronaldo's attendance at the White House, meanwhile, marks one of his first known visits to the US since 2016.In the interim he has faced an allegation of sexual assault. Kathryn Mayorga alleged that Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009, which he denied.\"I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in,\" he said in a statement in 2018.In 2019, US prosecutors said Ronaldo would not face charges because the claims could not be proven. In early 2023, Ronaldo made the jump to Saudi Arabia when he became the face of the Saudi Pro League and captain of Al Nassr - the football club owned by sovereign wealth fund PIF which is chaired by the crown prince.In an industry where players are paid extraordinary amounts of money, Ronaldo's pay deal with Saudi Arabia was astronomical. The footballer was reportedly paid $200m (£152m) a year - or more than half a million dollars a day. Then in June this year, he signed a new two-year deal for a reported total of $400m (£300m) and became football's first billionaire player, according to Bloomberg, with a net worth of $1.4bn.That's a lot of money for a 40-year-old footballer in the twilight of his career.But, according to Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, Saudi Arabia has \"invested heavily in high profile events and individuals to put the kingdom on the map\" in terms of sports and tourism in its quest for modernism.Ronaldo has referred to bin Salman as \"our boss\" in an interview with broadcaster Piers Morgan.Earlier this month, he appeared at a Ministry of Tourism event in Riyadh where he talked up the kingdom's development projects and his hopes for the 2034 FIFA World Cup being held in Saudi Arabia.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says Saudi crown prince \"knew nothing\" about Jamal Khashoggi's murderUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".It was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing. \"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" \"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\". A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report. While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.Hanan Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi's widow, speaks to BBC after Trump defends Saudi crown princeReacting to Trump's comments, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan, told BBC Newsnight the US president's defence of the crown prince did not match up with bin Salman's own acknowledgment of responsibility for her husband's murder.\"The crown prince himself, in 2019 and 60 Minutes interview, he did take accountability about and hold responsibility about this horrible crime,\" she said.In a post on X, she also called for a meeting with the crown prince and an apology along with compensation for her husband's murder.Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year. Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\". The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis. Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin. The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s. The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added. The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday. Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also present at the dinner. Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues. ",

    "body": "Ex-Harvard president Larry Summers steps back from public role after Epstein email release21 hours agoMax MatzaReutersFormer Harvard University president Larry Summers has said he will step back from public commitments after his emails with disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein were made public.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognise the pain they have caused,\" he said in a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Emails released by a House committee last week show Summers, a former US treasury secretary, communicated with Epstein until the day before the Epstein's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors.On Tuesday, House members are expected to vote on a measure calling for the release of all Epstein-related files that have yet to be made public.The measure would then head to the Senate, and require the approval of US President Donald Trump.Summers served as treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton and director of the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama. He was president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and is currently a professor there.He wrote in his statement on Monday: \"I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein.\"He added that he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\".\"While continuing to fulfil my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" Summers wrote.The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, also announced on Monday that he was no longer affiliated with the organisation.Summers is still listed as a member of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI's board, which he joined in 2023 following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive Sam Altman. The BBC has contacted OpenAI and a representative for Summers about whether he will remain a director at the company.Summers' move comes after the US Department of Justice announced that it would investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with former President Bill Clinton, who was also a friend of Epstein, and several other prominent Democrats.Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. The department's decision came at the urging of Trump, who also asked for Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and banks JP Morgan and Chase, to be investigated.Hoffman is yet to comment. A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regretted \"any association\" it had with Epstein, and added that it \"did not help him commit his heinous acts\".Trump was also mentioned in the emails, which do not imply any wrongdoing.\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" he wrote on social media.\"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"The emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week indicate that Summers and Epstein met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"president [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\".In a separate email just after Trump's first election in 2016, Summers told Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\".Due to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", Putin \"proximity\" and \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\".A representative for Summers previously told US media that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein\" after Epstein's conviction in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.The emails mention many high-profile figures. A review by the Wall Street Journal found Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 of the 2,324 email threads.Trump has repeatedly said he severed contact with the financier years before Epstein was convicted in 2008, and was unaware of his criminal activity. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.While Trump was discussed in some of the messages released last week, he did not send or receive them.",

    "body": "'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance1 day agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countries\"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.Cho says that when she was younger, people didn't know what it meant to be Korean in the USAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro 'ready to talk' as US ramps up pressure19 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News Online'Face to face': Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro open to US talksVenezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has said that he is willing to hold face-to-face talks with representatives of the Trump administration as US pressure on him grows.Maduro made the comment hours after US President Donald Trump said he had not ruled out deploying ground forces to the South American country.The Trump administration has accused Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as rigged by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.Maduro has denied the allegation and accuses the US of trying to incite a war to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves. Since Trump was sworn in to a second term in office in January, the US government has been increasing its pressure on Maduro.It has doubled the reward it offers for information leading to his capture to $50m (38m) and in August launched a counternarcotics operation targeting boats it accuses of transporting drugs from Venezuela to the US.More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on suspected vessels since, most of them in the Caribbean as well as some in the Pacific.According to US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" is to remove \"narcoterrorists\" from the Western Hemisphere.But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs. It is also unclear how much of an impact the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US.The size of the US military deployment - which includes the US Navy's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford - has also led to speculation both in Venezuela and in the US that its real aim is to remove Maduro from power.Trump has been repeatedly asked by journalists about his government's plan and has given seemingly contradictory answers. Asked by US broadcaster CBS on 3 November whether the US was going to war with Venezuela, Trump said, \"I don't think so\".But on Sunday, when asked whether he would rule out US troops on the ground in Venezuela, he answered: \"No, I don't rule out that, I don't rule out anything.\"However, when pressed on whether he would speak to his Venezuelan counterpart directly, he said: \"I would probably talk to him, yeah.\"  \"I talk to everybody,\" Trump added. Also on Sunday, the US state department said it \"intended to designate Cartel de los Soles\", the Venezuelan drug trafficking gang it alleges is led by Maduro, as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).But rather than doing so immediately, the state department said the move would become effective on 24 November. This delay - combined with Trump leaving the door open to direct talks - has been interpreted by some as a US ultimatum for Maduro: enter into negotiations or face even more draconian US measures.Being labelled as an FTO means it becomes illegal for US citizens to knowingly provide material support or resources to the group in question. According to the White House, it also then becomes the policy of the US to \"ensure the total elimination of these organisations' presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States\".Some analysts think that just as the Trump administration has argued that it is legal to target alleged drug boats in the Caribbean because of the danger they say they pose to US citizens, it could use the FTO designation to bolster support for strikes against the Cartel de los Soles on Venezuelan soil.In several of his recent public appearances, Maduro has addressed the US people directly, even speaking - and once even singing - in English. On Monday, he said \"dialogue, call, yes, peace, yes, war, no, never, never war\" and stressed that he was ready to talk \"face to face\" with anyone in the US \"who wants to talk to Venezuela\".Past attempts by various parties at negotiating with representatives of the Maduro government have failed. Talks between the Venezuelan opposition and the Maduro government mediated by Norway and held in Barbados broke down as did an earlier Vatican-backed effort at finding a way out of Venezuela's political crisis. While the US has been ratcheting up the pressure on Maduro, Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize Winner María Corina Machado has been trying to encourage the Venezuelan military to switch sides and turn on Maduro.Speaking and posting from an undisclosed location in Venezuela, where she has been hiding to escape arrest, Machado has long denounced the Maduro government as \"a criminal structure\" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it. On Tuesday, she uploaded what she called a \"freedom manifesto\" to social media in which she outlined her vision for a post-Maduro Venezuela. In it she states that \"we stand at the edge of a new era - one where our natural rights will prevail\" and argues that Maduro and his close allies need to be held accountable for \"crimes against humanity\", citing the mistreatment of political prisoners and detainees under his rule.

    "body": "3 hours agoAna Faguyon Capitol HillGetty ImagesBoth chambers of  Congress agreed to order the US justice department to release its files on sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the measure in a 427-1 vote and the Senate unanimously fast-tracked it without a formal vote. The moves come just days after President Donald Trump reversed his position and urged Congress to vote to disclose the records following public pushback from many of his supporters. Last week, Trump and his ties to Epstein were thrust back into the headlines after more than 20,000 pages of documents - some mentioning the president - were released. The White House denied any wrongdoing.Republican Clay Higgins, of Louisiana, was the sole House objector and cited his concern about “innocent people being hurt” with the release of the information. Trump’s reversal from attacking those on Capitol Hill who wanted the files released to saying there was “nothing to hide” surprised some in Washington. The Republican congressional leadership was caught off guard after aligning their message with the president for the past few weeks and opposing the release. House Speaker Mike Johnson had repeatedly called the push to release the Epstein files a \"Democrat hoax\". On Tuesday, he voted in support of release. What do we know about the Epstein files?Epstein saga reveals Republican rifts - and the power of Trump's baseThe only 'no' vote on releasing Epstein filesThe measure had been expected to take a few days to reach the US Senate, but after the resounding afternoon vote in the House, the timeline quickly sped up. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer brought up the bill on the floor of the Senate under a procedure called unanimous consent. Because no one objected, there was no debate and no amendments added to the bill. It will head from the Senate to the president‘s desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.A congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own.The bill requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell no later than 30 days after the law is enacted.Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs and people and entities connected to Epstein. But the bill also gives Bondi the power to withhold information that would jeopardise any active federal investigation or identifies any victims. Epstein, a financier, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking, having previously been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. During two criminal investigations into Epstein, thousands of documents were gathered, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses. Trump and Epstein previously socialised in similar circles, but the president said he cut ties with Epstein many years ago, before his 2008 conviction. The president also said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal activity. Last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email chains, including correspondence between Epstein and Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.Some of those make mention of Trump, including one email, sent in 2011, in which Epstein wrote to Maxwell: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.” The White House said last week that the victim referenced in the email was prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.‘She did it’: Virginia Giuffre’s family speaks to BBC after Congress approves release of Epstein filesGiuffre, who died in April, said that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse and there is no implication of any wrongdoing by Trump in the emails.Speaking after the vote, Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts praised her sister's role in seeking justice for Epstein survivors.\"She did it, she paved the way... She paved the way for us to come forward as advocates, for her survivor sisters to come forward, and we won't stop,\" Roberts said.Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".The push for the release of the investigative files held by the Department of Justice was led by Republican Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman who sometimes dissents from his party, and Democrat Ro Khanna, a California congressman, both of whom introduced the legislation.Massie has faced criticism from Trump for his push to release the files, but has stood firm. “In 2030, he’s not going to be the president,” Massie said to ABC News over the weekend. He added that fellow Republicans who voted against release \"will have voted to protect paedophiles”. Another Republican who has pushed for the release of the files is House Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. She had been a staunch supporter of Trump before the two fell out over the issue, with the president now calling her a \"traitor\". At a news conference earlier in the day on Tuesday, Greene said she is speaking up on behalf of Epstein's survivors. She also called out Trump directly.\"Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves; a patriot is an American that serves the United States of America and Americans like the women standing behind me,\" Greene said.She said that row over Epstein has been one of the \"most destructive things\" to Trump's Make America Great Again movement since his election in 2016. Survivors of Epstein’s abuse also spoke at the news conference, urging lawmakers to release the files and pushing Trump to do the same.Epstein survivor Annie Farmer said that keeping the files under wraps amounted to “institutional betrayal”. “Because these crimes were not properly investigated, so many more girls and women were harmed,” Ms Farmer said.",

    "body": "What does Trump want with boat strike campaign?1 day agoBernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Joshua Cheetham,BBC VerifyUS Southern CommandThe US military posted a video Sunday showing a strike on an alleged drug boat in the eastern PacificUS airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have continued unabated since early September - a deadly campaign now dubbed Operation Southern Spear. Tens of thousands of troops and substantial air and naval assets have been deployed to the region, collectively forming the largest US military presence in and around Latin America in decades. On Sunday the US military confirmed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, had arrived in the Caribbean. The Trump administration argues the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to the US. They have, however, been controversial and sparked fears of a wider conflict in the region. Why is the US conducting strikes?President Trump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary counter-drug measure to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to US streets. In a statement, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which on 13 November was officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".But little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon. In at least a few cases, Hegseth and several other officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year. It is unclear how much of an impact US officials believe that the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US. Where are US military units?The US has deployed substantial strike power in the Caribbean and western Atlantic within striking distance of Venezuela.BBC Verify has identified 15 warships in the region based on ship-tracking data, satellite imagery and announcements by US authorities.This includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, described by the US Navy as \"the most capable, adaptable, and lethal combat platform in the world\".The deployment also includes a range of guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops. Additionally, US combat aircraft have been deployed to bases in Puerto Rico, and US long-range bombers have flown within striking distance of Venezuela's coastline. Trump has also acknowledged that he authorised the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela, although the scope of what that could mean remains highly classified.How many strikes have there been?Between 2 September and 16 November, US forces hit at least 22 vessels in 21 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific. The majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. US Southern Command announced on Sunday that its latest strike, conducted on Saturday in eastern Pacific international waters, killed three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board. \"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Southern Command wrote in a post on X, alongside a video showing the boat exploding in a massive fireball. Collectively, at least 83 people have been killed. While US forces have not publicly identified them, they have all been alleged to be \"narco-terrorists\". One investigation, from the Associated Press, reported that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss. Are these boat strikes legal? The Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.In a confidential note to Congress, the administration argued that the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" and whose actions - drug trafficking - \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\".But some legal experts have said the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), told the BBC that he believes that the strikes could be treated as crimes against humanity.Critics have also questioned whether the White House complied with US law in initially authorising the strikes.According to the US constitution, only Congress is able to declare war.In October, President Trump said the US is \"allowed\" to strike vessels near Venezuela, but that his administration \"may go back to Congress\" if the campaign was expanded to include targets on land.\"We don't have to do that,\" he said. \"But I think...I'd like to do that.\"Is the US preparing to attack Venezuela?The build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially to try to topple the left-wing socialist government of President Nicolás Maduro. On 3 November, Trump downplayed the possibility of a war with Venezuela, but suggested that he believed Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered. Asked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it.\" \"I don't think so,\" he added. \"But they've been treating us very badly.\" How has Maduro responded? The Maduro government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government. In response, the Venezuelan military have announced readiness exercises and in November declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country. Maduro has cautioned against the US becoming involved in Venezuela, and called for peace. \"No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan,\" Maduro said on CNN on 13 November. \"Long live peace.\"Additional reporting by Tom Edgington",

Over.\"Through heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt.\"I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,\" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin.This is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\"; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports.After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance.European coastguards and navies are regularly coming in contact with vessels in Russia's shadow fleet which they suspect are transporting oilSome \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data.Out on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating.As the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance.That is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, \"good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost\".Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag.The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says that vessels travel back and forth, past Estonia, to major Russian oil terminalsThe head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two.The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk.What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\"We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure.Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction.The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap.Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade.Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships.By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK.The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number.In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as \"false\". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry.The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called FMTC Ship Charter LLC, but our emails and our calls went unanswered.The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI.Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection.Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point \"where they just don't even bother at all\", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann.Unity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it.By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication.The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties.Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly detained at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages.Planet LabsAt the time of publication the vessel was anchored just outside the major Russian oil port, Ust-LugaUnity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to UK and EU service and port bans as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin.Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago.Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air finds that \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself.While politicians talk of toughening action, navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea.The right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it.Countries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event.\"There's a complexity associated with it,\" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. \"With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis.\"Frans SanderseUnity sailing under a former name, Ocean ExplorerThe Estonians speak from experience.When they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has \"constantly\" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk.The fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken.\"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, \"we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself\".\"Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies.\"Back on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up.\"Thank you for your co-operation,\" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia.The exchange lasted just over five minutes.\"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\"But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\"There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\".The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's \"anti-Russian sanctions\" were \"illegitimate\" and \"undermine established principles of global commerce\".\"Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,\" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to \"easily resolved\" issues such as administrative delays.It was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had \"heightened\" the risks by \"forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape\".Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray, Michael Steininger and Ali Zaidi",

    "body": "8 hours agoRaghvendra RaoBBC Hindi, BiharSeraj AliLalmunni Devi, who lost her husband to toxic liquor in 2022, says alcohol abuse upended her lifeNine years after imposing a statewide alcohol ban to curb addiction, domestic violence, and financial ruin among its poorest families, Bihar - India's poorest state - still struggles to gauge the policy's effectiveness.The gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers.Armed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery.On reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor.Vapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm.The officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived. \"They often get tipped off before a raid,\" an officer who didn't wish to be named said. Despite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains firmly in place in Bihar.Passed in 2016 by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after persistent demands from women's groups, the law was among the factors that helped his Janata Dal (United) - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance clinch a decisive state election victory earlier this month.State officials tout the policy's success by pointing to big numbers: since the law took effect, 1.1 million cases have been registered and 650,000 people convicted for violations. But the devil lies in the detail.More than 99% of these convictions are for consumption, rather than production, selling, or transport of illicit liquor. Moreover, alcohol remains widely available in the black market in Bihar. In the six weeks leading to the recently held election, illicit alcohol worth more than 522 million rupees ($6.26 million, £4.96 million) was seized from across the state. Seraj AliA makeshift setup of metal drums fermenting jaggery into country liquorSo why has Bihar been unable to enforce its ban more effectively?Local police, who did not want to come on record, say it is a combination of several factors - including staff shortages, increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods and possible collusion between liquor makers and authorities.\"There are laws that prescribe life imprisonment or even the death penalty for murder. But does that stop people from committing murder? No, it doesn't,\" said Ratnesh Sada, an outgoing minister whose department handled prohibition issues.Mr Sada, however, insisted that action has been taken against at least a hundred individuals engaged in illegal alcohol trade, with their properties seized.\"We destroy these setups, but within days they are up and running again,\" said Sunil Kumar, an excise official.Bihar's geography makes enforcement even harder. The landlocked state borders Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal -  all of which allow alcohol and serve as major sources of smuggled liquor. It also shares a 726km (449 mile), largely porous border with Nepal, which officials say has become a key conduit for alcohol smuggling, further complicating enforcement.Seraj AliBihar has a thriving black market in locally-brewed alcoholDespite the challenges, many women in Bihar -  who still carry deep scars from their husbands' alcohol abuse -  want the ban to continue.In Chhapra district, Lalmunni Devi, who lost her husband after he consumed toxic liquor in 2022, said her life had been upended by alcohol abuse.\"I just hope no one else has to suffer the same fate,\" she said.Neetu Devi, another widow, broke down as she recalled her husband's death.\"If the government were to shut down all such factories entirely, it [liquor] would no longer be available. It continues to be produced, and that's why people keep consuming it,\" she said.Rajeev Kamal Kumar, an anthropologist at Patna's AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, who worked on a government study of prohibition, says both sides of the story are true.\"Many women and elders say prohibition has improved household finances, children's education, and nutrition. But it is undeniable that illegal trade continues,\" he said.Bihar is neither the first nor the only Indian state to impose prohibition; several others have tried it over the years. But such measures often trigger unintended consequences - from thriving black markets and deaths from illicit brews, to enforcement challenges that drain state resources.The financial cost has also been considerable, as alcohol taxes remain a key source of revenue for many state governments.Gujarat and Nagaland have had bans since 1960 and 1989, yet both still grapple with bootlegging.Mizoram imposed prohibition in 1997, lifted it in 2015, reinstated it in 2019, and then relaxed it again in 2022 to allow the manufacture, sale and export of wine made from local grapes.Some other states have rolled back prohibition after encountering economic and administrative challenges.For now, with the outgoing government slated to return to power, prohibition will remain in Bihar. But the policy remains a paradox - hailed as a social reform by some, criticised as ineffective by others.Whether it has succeeded or merely shifted the problem underground is a question that continues to haunt the state.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "1 day agoCelia HattonGetty ImagesSince 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications.But the rules weren't always so strict.In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity.\"Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'\" he remembers. \"I was astonished!\"In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership.US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned.Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.Jeff Stein's story brought a swift reaction in WashingtonIn the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret.But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: \"There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence.\"The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA.Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale.Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018.Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent.\"For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,\" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \"And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses.\"AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China.A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the first known effort to tally all of China's state-backed investments around the world. The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access.AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries.Getty ImagesMore than 70% of the container shipping terminals at Rotterdam, the largest seaport in Europe, are Chinese-owned  \"China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,\" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds. That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities.\"The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,\" Mr Shih says. \"This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis.\"Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025.In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year. Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China.Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it \"stayed very much alive\" as a guiding strategy.\"There are all kinds of plans still being published,\" he says, \"including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan.\"At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating \"high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement\" until 2030.AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how the Chinese government bankrolled the purchase of a UK semiconductor company.The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA.AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy.\"At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,\" he says. \"I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen.\"However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts.\"The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,\" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC.\"Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation.\"China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment.In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company.It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech.Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company.That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing.Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions. The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets.Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past.\"We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,\" she says. \"Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this.\"Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China.\"There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,\" she says. \"Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe.\"If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over?\"No! There's gonna be multiple laps,\" maintains Brad Parks. \"There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital.\"So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot. \"They're going to move from defence to offence.\"",

    "body": "'It would have been better if they'd killed me': A forgotten war destroying women's lives4 hours agoBBC World ServiceKlawe RzeczyWarning: This report contains descriptions of rape and sexual violence. Names of victims have been changed and identifying details omitted to protect their privacy and safety.Enat was at home with her eight-year-old niece when the soldiers came one Sunday morning, she says.The Ethiopian army was carrying out searches of homes in the Amhara region on 5 January this year, as part of a crackdown on a growing rebellion launched by local militias known as Fano.Enat says three men, dressed in army uniform, entered her home in South Gondar and began asking questions about her family background and whether Fano fighters had visited the beer hall where she worked.Enat, 21, said they had.\"How could we lie? How can we hide the truth?\" Enat says, noting that Fano - an Amharic word loosely translated as volunteer fighters - is made up of locals.Things quickly escalated.After asking questions about her family background, Enat says the soldiers began insulting her, then threatened her niece with a gun when the little girl started crying.Enat says one of the soldiers then raped her in front of her niece while the others kept guard.\"I begged them not to hurt me. I called on the saints and begged them. But their hearts didn't pity me. They violated me.\"Thousands of reports of rape and assaultEnat, who is from the Amhara ethnic group, the second largest in Ethiopia, is among thousands of women believed to have been sexually assaulted and raped since the conflict between the Ethiopian army and Fano started in August 2023.Sexual violence in the region is largely undocumented, but the BBC has collated data which shows there have been thousands of reports of rape between July 2023 and May 2025, with victims as young as eight and as old as 65.While restrictions have prevented independent media from entering Amhara to cover the conflict, the BBC team in Nairobi, in neighbouring Kenya, managed to speak to women and doctors in the region, offering a rare insight into the human impact of the crisis.The conflict began when the government attempted to disband regional military groups, including those in Amhara, which had fought with the army during the 2020-2022 civil war in the next-door region of Tigray.Fano militias felt betrayed by the move and believed it would leave them vulnerable to attack from Tigray and elsewhere, especially as violence against the Amhara community had intensified, according to rights groups.In response, Fano launched a rebellion, seizing major towns. They claim to be fighting for regional autonomy and protecting their communities from marginalisation by the Ethiopian government.The insurgency has resulted in a violent crackdown by the army, which calls Fano \"radical ethno-nationalists\".Klawe RzeczySince the conflict started, both sides have been accused of numerous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, forced displacement, destruction of property, looting and widespread cases of sexual violence, including rape.Rights groups, including Amnesty International, say there is evidence the army is disproportionately responsible for the abuses. They also say that Amhara people in other parts of Ethiopia have been deliberately targeted by the security forces and other armed groups.Before she was attacked, Enat had never had sex and planned to one day marry at her local church in a ceremony conducted in accordance with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church's rites, just as other women in her family had done.Such marriages are among the most revered traditions of the Amhara people, who are predominantly Orthodox Christian, but it requires couples to remain \"pure\" and not have any sexual contact until marriage.\"Before that day, I had never known a man,\" she says.\"It would have been better if they had killed me.\"'My family found me unconscious'Tigist, 18, from West Gojjam, also in the Amhara region, worked in her family's small, traditional teahouse before she was attacked.She describes how, in January 2024, a soldier who was a regular customer groped her. She says she rejected him - an act she believes led to the attack.Later that evening, as she was returning home from work, she says three soldiers, including the man who groped her, ambushed her in the street and gang-raped her on the pavement.\"My family found me unconscious on the roadside,\" she recalls. \"They carried me to the clinic, where I spent five days.\"Since the attack, Tigist says she's been unable to leave her house, paralysed by fear of men and the outside world.\"My fear keeps me from going to work... Whenever I see soldiers or any men I panic and hide myself away.\"She ended up retreating from her life and breaking off her engagement. She says she never told her fiance why or what happened.Overwhelmed by despair, Tigist attempted to take her own life, but her family intervened just in time and saved her. She says that although she has contemplated suicide since then, she has promised her family she will not try to kill herself again.'It is repulsive to have been born a woman'The BBC collected data from 43 health facilities in Amhara - roughly 4% of all health facilities in the region - and other medical sources to get a snapshot of what has been happening.At these facilities, there were 2,697 reports of rape between 18 July 2023 and May 2025. Children under 18 accounted for 45% of cases.Just over half of the victims tested positive for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), while many were also left pregnant and with severe psychological trauma.However, many victims of sexual violence never report the crime or seek treatment, fearful of stigma or of learning they may have contracted an STI or become pregnant.For this reason, a senior health expert, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, says the victims who come to facilities in the Amhara region are only \"the tip of the iceberg\".Lemlem is among those who have never reported their rape or sought medical treatment, terrified of learning that she might have a sexually transmitted infection, such as HIV.The 23-year-old from South Gondar says government soldiers entered her house on 6 January to ask for information, a routine army practice.She says when she didn't give them what they wanted, one of the soldiers raped her.\"He threatened me, saying: 'If you scream, one bullet is enough for you,'\" Lemlem says.\"I wept non-stop for a whole month. I couldn't eat. All I did was cry. I couldn't stand to walk. And I fell gravely ill.\"She says the assault has driven her away from church, where she fears she may be the subject of gossip.\"It's repulsive to have been born a woman. If I were a man, they might have beaten me and walked away - they wouldn't have destroyed my life like this,\" says Lemlem, explaining how the trauma of the attack has made her feel about being female.Klawe RzeczyMedics the BBC spoke to say there has been a sharp rise in the number of victims of sexual violence that they have been treating since the conflict began.\"They arrive trembling, too intimidated even to speak,\" one medic says.Yet those who do come forward are reluctant to name their attackers and rarely seek justice, in part because the conflict has led to a breakdown in law and order.  Instead, most who do seek medical assistance come out of fear of pregnancy.Others seek treatment long after they have been attacked, by which point certain medications for the STIs they have contracted, such as HIV, are no longer effective.HIV can often be prevented with a treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis, but only if it is administered soon after sex with someone who was infected.Another medic notes that many victims say they are unable to access treatment promptly due to transport disruption and road blockages caused by the conflict.A senior medic warns they fear a public health and social crisis could be looming.Based on information health centres have gathered, they say that they \"have identified signs that HIV infections may rise and that mental health and psychological problems could reach catastrophic levels\", noting that some victims have attempted suicide.Figures from Ethiopia's health ministry in 2022 showed that the HIV rate in the region was around 1.1 per 100 people - higher than the national average.While assaults have been carried out by both sides in the conflict, medical staff report seeing more cases involving Ethiopian army soldiers than Fano militia. A government employee with access to relevant information, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, also said this was the case.Most incidents of rape were reported in urban areas where the army maintains bases and exerts control, however experts point out that people living in cities have better access to treatment so are more likely to get help and report attacks.The BBC was unable to interview any victims of assaults by Fano fighters due to limited access to places where the militia are based.In June 2024, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that the Ethiopian National Defence Force, which includes the army, had perpetrated sexual violence, including against minors, in the Amhara region during the conflict with Fano militia.The BBC asked Ethiopia's ministry of defence to respond to allegations, but despite months of waiting, we have not received a reply.Repeated BBC requests for detailed information from regional authorities were also unsuccessful.A Fano leader, Asres Mare Damtie, told the BBC the group was unaware of any involvement by its fighters, saying no accusations had been made against them and it enforces severe punishment, including death, for offenders.The BBC has learned that a government-commissioned investigation led by Ethiopia's Bahir Dar University into conflict-related sexual violence against women in Amhara has begun, with findings expected to be released publicly in the coming months.In 2021, when the army and its allies - which then included Fano - faced similar allegations over their conduct in the Tigray conflict, the government condemned the use of rape but dismissed the claims as \"biased and flawed\".To date, no official action has been publicly disclosed against perpetrators.Amnesty International has raised concerns over what it believes is a persistent pattern of impunity in Ethiopia's army. \"There is no meaningful effort to bring perpetrators into justice,\" says the organisation's regional researcher, Haimanot Ashenafi. \"They're still fighting, they are still out there with no consequences for what they've done… survivors who have gone through this life-changing experience deserve justice.\"For Enat, the consequences of her attack have been far-reaching.A month after the assault, she fled her village to escape the trauma of the attack.It was then she learned she was pregnant as a result of the rape.\"I started vomiting,\" she recalls.She thought of having an abortion, which is legally permitted in Ethiopia up to 12 weeks into pregnancy if a woman is raped, but she was scared.\"I feared God, and I felt for my mother. What would become of her if I died during the abortion?\"She gave birth to a daughter in early September after three days of labour.Despite what happened to her, Enat considers the baby a \"gift from God\".But she is currently living with a relative and is unable to work as she has to look after her daughter. She worries for the future and how she will provide for her child and herself.\"If this is what is considered to be living, then yes, I am living,\" she adds.If you, or someone you know, have been affected by the issues raised in this story, details of organisations offering information and support are available at BBC ActionLine.This is part of the Global Women series from the BBC World Service, sharing untold and important stories from around the globe",

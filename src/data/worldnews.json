    "body": "A fire that broke out in a nursing home in northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina has left 11 people dead and at least 30 others injured, authorities say.The blaze started on Tuesday night at the retirement facility in the town of Tuzla, breaking out on the seventh floor shortly after 20:45 local time (19:45 GMT).Around 20 people were sent to a medical centre for treatment, including firefighters, police officers, medical workers, employees, and residents of the home, a police spokesperson said.While cause of the fire was not immediately clear, Prime Minister Nermin Nikšić called it \"a disaster of enormous proportions\".Officials said a full investigation would be conducted as soon as conditions were safe.A resident of the nursing home, Ruza Kajic, said she lived on the third floor of the building and was woken up after hearing a \"cracking sound\".\"I looked out the window and saw burning material falling from above. I ran out into the hallway. On the upper floors, there are bed-ridden people,\" she told public broadcaster BHRT.Footage from the scene showed flames erupting from the windows of an upper floor of the nursing home.The head of the nursing home, Mirsad Bakalović, said he knew everyone who had been caught up in the fire and after everything he had seen during the fire he had decided to resign.The chairman of Bosnia-Herzegovina's tripartite presidency, Željko Komšić, offered condolences to the victims' families and the injured.According to a spokesperson for the Tuzla University clinical centre, several patients were being treated for carbon monoxide poisoning, three of whom were in intensive care, local media reported.",

    "body": "18 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterThe head of Britain's richest family, Gopichand Hinduja, has died aged 85.Known as GP, Mr Hinduja and his family made their fortune from the Indian conglomerate Hinduja Group, which operates in 11 sectors including finance, media and entertainment, and oil.It has about 200,000 staff around the world.The family said in a statement: \"He will leave a deep hole at the heart of our family.\"They added that he would be \"remembered for his formidable work\".Mr Hinduja helped transform his father's modest textile and trading businesses into a global conglomerate and one of India's largest companies.Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer, said he would be remembered as someone who \"personified\" the links between India and the UK.\"Whether it was in banking, whether it was in manufacturing, whether it was in property, they were always putting the UK and India together\"GP was not only a famous and respected individual in the UK and India but a great champion for our two countries. We shall miss him greatly.\"Mr Hinduja and his family topped the most recent Sunday Times Rich List with a net worth of £35.3bn. They also ranked 11th on the Forbes list of India's 100 richest businesspeople in 2024.Mr Hinduja was the second eldest of four brothers who controlled the business for decades.The oldest of the four, Srichand, died in 2023 at 87.It is not known who will now take over the leadership of the conglomerate. The youngest brother, Ashok, runs its operations across India including truck maker Ashok Leyland.The Hinduja conglomerate operates in 48 countries.The family also own significant real estate in London, including a number of large homes near to St James's Park and Winston Churchill's Old War Office in Whitehall, which has recently been refurbished to include a hotel.Mr Hinduja largely kept out of the public eye but was involved in the controversial \"Hinduja affair\" in 2001.Mr Hinduja had written to then-government minister Peter Mandelson about his brother Prakash obtaining British citizenship, after the family's charity had donated £1m to the Millennium Dome, for which Mandelson was responsible.Mandelson resigned as a minister as a result, but was later cleared of wrongdoing after an inquiry. Prakash, his wife, their son and his wife were jailed by a Swiss court last year for exploiting domestic staff in their Geneva mansion.",

    "body": "12 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesReddit is one of the latest platforms to be added to Australia's social media banPopular forum site Reddit has been added to Australia's world-first social media ban for children under 16 that starts next month.Live-streaming platform Kick will also be included, bringing the number of sites targeted in the ban to nine. They include Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Threads.From 10 December, tech companies can be fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to deactivate existing accounts for under-16s and prohibit new ones.Each banned platform was chosen as their \"sole or a significant purpose is to enable online social interaction,\" the government said, and more sites may be added given the \"fast-changing\" nature of technology.\"Delaying children's access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,\" said Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant.Messaging services Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms Lego Play and Roblox will not be included, nor will Google Classroom and YouTube Kids.Federal Communications Minister Anika Wells said the online platforms can target children with \"chilling control\" and the ban was about protecting children.\"We aren't chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference,\" she said.It is unclear how companies will implement the ban - which is being closely watched by global leaders - but some of the potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology. Critics have raised concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software, with a recent report showing the proposed methods all have risks or shortcomings. Most Australian adults support the ban, according to polls, but some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.Instead, they say, the government should focus on better policing of harmful content on social media platforms and prepare children for the reality of life on the web.An Australian influencer family who have millions of YouTube follower recently announced their decision to move to the UK to avoid the upcoming ban, namely so their 14-year-old daughter can continue to create online content.YouTube was initially exempt from the ban but in July, the government reversed its decision, saying the video sharing site was \"the most frequently cited platform\" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw \"harmful content\".Teens under 16 will still be able to view YouTube videos but will not be permitted to have an account, which is required for uploading content or interacting on the platform.",

    "body": "6 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterA collection of diaries has won the prestigious Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction for the first time.How to End a Story: Collected Diaries by Helen Garner charts the Australian writer's life from the early stages of her career in bohemian Melbourne, to raising her daughter in the 1970s, and her experience of a disintegrating marriage in the 1990s.Garner's previous work includes 2014's The House of Grief, which told the story of Robert Farquharson on trial for the murder of his three sons.Famous fans include fellow writer David Nicholls, and singer Dua Lipa, who said: \"Helen Garner's work is a thrilling discovery. She's one of the most fascinating writers I have come across.\"Chair of judges, Robbie Millen, said How to End a Story was the judges' unanimous winner, praising it as \"a remarkable, addictive book\".\"Garner takes the diary form, mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday, to new heights,\" he continued. \"She is a brilliant observer and listener - every page has a surprising, sharp or amusing thought. Her collected diaries will surely be mentioned alongside The Diary of Virginia Woolf.\" In her review, the Observer's Rachel Cooke also referenced the revered Modernist author, describing Garner's collection as \"the greatest, richest journals by a writer since Virginia Woolf's\".This marks the first major UK-based prize win for the Australian, who has been belatedly receiving attention in the UK following the British publication of three of her books for the first time last year.The Baillie Gifford Prize rewards the best of non-fiction and is open to authors of any nationality. As the winner, Garner will receive £50,000, with the other shortlisted authors each receiving £5,000, bringing the total prize value to £75,000.The selection was made from over 350 books published between 1 November 2024 and 31 October 2025.The others who made the shortlist were:The Revolutionists: The Story of the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970s by Jason Burke, about a group of extremists including Carlos the Jackal and the Baader-Meinhof Gang.The Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief by Richard Holmes, a biography about the young Alfred Lord TennysonCaptives and Companions: A History of Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Islamic World by Justin Marozzi, it covers slavery in the Islamic world from the 7th Century to the present dayLone Wolf: Walking the Faultlines of Europe by Adam Weymouth, this book follows a young wolf's 1000-mile trek across the European AlpsElectric Spark by Frances Wilson, a biography of novelist Muriel Spark",

    "body": "Suspected drone sightings have disrupted flights at airports across Belgium on Tuesday, with no flights departing or arriving at Brussels Airport - the country's busiest. Air traffic was suspended around 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) after a drone sighting. An hour later it briefly reopened, before closing again shortly after.Liege Airport was also affected and it was not clear when flights would resume. Local media also reported drone sightings at the Kleine-Brogel and Florennes military airbases, local media reported.It is the latest in a string of suspected drone sightings causing disruption at European airports - including in Munich, Copenhagen and Oslo.A statement on the Brussels Airport website on Tuesday evening read: \"There are currently no departing or arriving flights at Brussels Airport due to drone sightings around the airport.\"A later statement said: \"This disruption has led to delays and some flight cancellations and might still impact flight operations on Wednesday morning.\"Pictures taken inside the airport showed what appeared to be camp beds being readied for passengers.Officials at Brussels' second-largest airport, Charleroi, said air traffic was briefly halted there as a precaution too.Local media reported flights had initially been diverted to Liege - before that also closed due to suspected drone sightings.It added that flights had since been diverted to nearby airports - including Ostend and Charleroi in Belgium, and Eindhoven and Maastricht in the Netherlands.Tuesday was the fourth night in a row that the Belgian authorities reported drone sightings over Kleine-Brogel, a major military base near the Dutch border. Belgium's defence minister, Theo Francken, said on Monday that an investigation was under way, calling it \"a clear mission targeting Kleine Broge\".Drones were also seen close to Ostend and Antwerp's Deurne airports over the weekend, according to Belgian news site VRT.

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond Chia,Business reporter and Paul Kirby,Europe digital editorAsian online giant Shein along with Temu, AliExpress and Wish are being investigated by Paris prosecutors after France's consumer watchdog said childlike sex dolls had been found on Shein's platform.Shein promised to co-operate fully with authorities as the company prepared to open its first physical store on Wednesday, on the sixth floor of Paris department store BHV.BHV's decision to house the fast-fashion giant has angered rival clothing brands and a number have said they will leave the prestigious department store in protest.Fashion designer Agnès B said she would close her concession in BHV when her contract ended in January. \"I'm completely against this fast-fashion... there are jobs under threat, it's very bad,\" she told French radio. Shein spokesman Quentin Ruffat promised to provide information on sellers, buyers and products involved in selling the childlike sex dolls on its site.AliExpress told the BBC it takes the matter very seriously. Temu said it was not involved in the case and did not allow the sale of such items on its platform, although it told the BBC it was working with French authorities \"to reinforce our minor protection mechanism\". Wish has also been contacted for comment.Shein has become best known for its discounted and trendy clothes, but has drawn criticism over its environmental impact and working conditions.Protesters gathered outside the BHV store ahead of Shein's opening there, and Frédéric Merlin, whose SGM company runs BHV, has admitted that he considered ending the department store's partnership with the retailer.However, he said Shein's response had \"convinced me to continue\" and he expressed confidence in the products it was going to sell in his store. \"The clothes we're going to sell do not exploit workers or children,\" he told French radio.Shein, which was founded in China, is also set to open outlets in seven other cities, inside Galeries Lafayette department stores run by SGM. But Galeries Lafayette has refused to have anything to do with Shein and will withdraw its name from the stores in Angers, Dijon, Grenoble, Le Mans, Limoges, Orléans and Reims.The Paris prosecutor's office said Shein and the other three e-commerce platforms were being investigated over violent, pornographic or \"undignified messages\" that could be accessed by minors.Shein and AliExpress are also under investigation over the dissemination of content related to children that are of a pornographic nature, the prosecutor's office said.The cases have been referred to the Paris Office des Mineurs, the prosecution service added. The office is an arm of the French police force that oversees the protection of minors.AliExpress said the listings in question violated its policies and were removed once it became aware of them.\"Sellers found to violate or trying to circumvent these requirements will be penalised in accordance with our rules,\" AliExpress said in a statement.On Monday, Shein said it had banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform worldwide. The Singapore-based retailer also said that it would permanently block all seller accounts related to the illegal sale of the childlike dolls and set stricter controls on its platform.The French consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, had said the sex dolls' description and categorisation left \"little doubt as to the child pornography nature\" of the products.",

    "body": "12 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, OttawaCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has put forward his first federal budget, which lays out an ambitious plan to transform Canada's economy and deal with the challenge of US tariffs.Billed an \"investment budget\" by the government, the fiscal plan increases Canada's deficit to C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), the second largest in history. The spending is offset by plans to attract C$1tn of investment into Canada over the next five years, with the federal government arguing more restrained spending would eliminate \"vital social programmes\" and funding for Canada's future. The budget does outline cuts, however, including slashing the size of the federal workforce by some 10% in the coming years. The budget was presented by Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, in the House of Commons late on Tuesday afternoon. In his budget speech, Champagne warned that Canada is facing \"a time of profound change\" and that \"bold and swift action is needed\" to ensure the country prospers.Peppered throughout the budget are references to uncertainty and the need for protectionist measures as a result of US tariffs on Canada. President Donald Trump has placed a broad 35% levy on Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, and has tariffed specific sectors like steel, aluminium and automobiles. These levies, enacted earlier this year, have already led to Canadian job losses in those sectors, and business leaders have warned of a chill on investment in Canada due to trade uncertainty. To counter this, the budget proposes spending of C$280bn over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\". These include updating ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade, as well as direct financing to support firms impacted by tariffs.The fiscal update also outlines a plan to boost Canada's competitiveness, with the goal of making Canada a more attractive place to do business than the US.Rebekah Young, the head of inclusion and resilience economics at Scotiabank, said the budget lays out a plan to reduce timelines and smooth regulatory hurdles with the hopes that it will boost private investment in Canada over the years.But she cautioned that parts of the budget might be a hard sell for Canadians struggling immediately with the cost of living.\"They're going to open this budget and not see any new (supports),\" she said. And while the budget delivers on its promise of generational spending, Ms Young said it remains to be seen if it will be as \"transformational\" as Carney hopes.\"We want to unlock a trillion dollars based on this investment here. A lot has to happen to get to that trillion,\" she said. On defence, the budget pledges nearly C$82bn over five years—the largest funding in decades—putting Canada in line with its Nato commitment to spend 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on its military by this year.The Carney government is also betting big on AI, proposing nearly C$1bn to boost integration and use of the rapidly growing technology, including in government operations.Carney warned Canadians ahead of the budget of \"sacrifices\". Among them is a reduction of the size of the federal government that would result in 40,000 job losses by 2029. International aid is also slated to be cut to pre-pandemic levels. Immigration targets have been lowered slightly over the next three years to \"stabilise\" new admissions to the country, including a significant cut to student visas.The budget will need to be passed by Canada's parliament before it's implemented. Carney's Liberal government is just shy of a majority, meaning it will need the support of other parties to enact its fiscal plan. Failure to pass the budget could risk a federal election. One Conservative MP, Chris d'Entremont, said in a statement released by the Liberals on Tuesday night that he had resigned from the Conservative caucus and will be crossing the floor to Carney’s party.In the statement, the MP said that the  budget “hits the priorities I have heard most in my riding“.​​This narrows Carney's razor-thin minority at a critical time.Meanwhile, Conservative opposition MPs have criticised the budget for increasing Canada's deficit while doing little to address affordability for Canadians. Yves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois party, said his caucus does not see how they could support the budget. Members of the left-leaning New Democratic Party said they will take the time to study it, but have criticised planned public sector cuts. With the projected larger deficit, Carney's fiscal plan maintains that Canada's still has the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the G7, behind only Japan.",

    "body": "23 hours agoGetty ImagesA search and rescue operation continues for the rest of the group, which includes other foreign nationals and local guidesDiwakar Pyakurel & Phanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali in Kathmandu and Kathryn ArmstrongAt least seven climbers, including five foreigners and two Nepalis, have died after being hit by an avalanche on a Himalayan peak in north-eastern Nepal, expedition agency Seven Summit Treks said.The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. Rescuers located two bodies, and are still searching for the remaining five, who are believed to have been buried by snow. Eight others have been rescued and are in the capital Kathmandu getting treatment for their injuries.All these climbers were part of a group that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told BBC Nepali. The bodies of the other five deceased climbers \"may be 10-15 feet below the snow\", said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks. \"It will take time to find them.\"Those killed include two Italians, a Canadian, a German, a French national, and two Nepalis who served as guides. Local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC on Monday that a rescue helicopter had landed in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp.One of the injured climbers told The Kathmandu Post that they had repeatedly called for help, to no avail. \"Had the rescue arrived on time, more lives could have been saved,\" he told the newspaper.Mr Mahato told reporters that rescue efforts were hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, which made it hard to fly helicopters or reach the site on foot.The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft). They had planned to climb the 5,630m Yalung Ri as part of their acclimatisation schedule.Separately, the bodies of two Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale another mountain in Nepal have been recovered, officials have confirmed.Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week on the Panbari mountain in western Nepal. The third member of the group, named in media reports as Velter Perlino, 65, was able to be rescued, along with one sherpa.The group had been granted permission to climb the 6,887m peak, but were reported missing when they lost contact with the base camp following heavy snowfall on 28 October.\"When a helicopter was sent yesterday [Monday] to the Panbari peak for rescue operations, it could not find them, but rescued one Italian team leader and a sherpa from the base camp,\" Himal Gautam, department of tourism director, said. Their bodies were recovered on Tuesday and have been flown to Kathmandu.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains. Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas. Two British and one Irish woman were among a group that had to be rescued after being trapped for several days in the western Mustang region. Severe weather also left hundreds of hikers stranded near Mount Everest in October. ",

    "body": "Israel has confirmed the latest body of a hostage returned by Hamas via the Red Cross is that of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen.The 19-year-old's remains were handed over on Tuesday as part of a Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by US President Donald Trump last month.\"Following the completion of the identification process... [Israel Defense Forces] representatives informed the family of the fallen hostage, Staff Sergeant Itay Chen, that their loved one has been returned to Israel and positively identified,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said.Earlier, Hamas's military wing said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.Israel had allowed members of the Palestinian armed group and Red Cross staff to search for the remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.Staff Sgt Chen was serving as a soldier in the IDF's 7th Brigade when Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023. The IDF said he was killed inside a tank during a battle in Kibbutz Nir Oz and that his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage by Hamas.\"The remains of Itay Chen, a young American taken hostage by Hamas at just 19 years old, have finally returned home. We honour his life, mourn his loss, and stand with his family,\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel welcomed his return but also stressed that there were seven deceased hostages still in Gaza. \"Please don't stop until they are all back home. Until the last hostage,\" it said.On Wednesday morning, Nasser hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis said it had received the bodies of another 15 dead Palestinians from Israel via the Red Cross.For each dead Israeli hostage returned, Israel has agreed to hand over the remains of 15 Palestinians. But with no DNA testing available in Gaza, it is hard to identify them. The Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages since the ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October.Hamas has insisted it is difficult to locate the bodies under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Trump's Gaza peace plan, including plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.The US has now reportedly drafted a UN Security Council resolution that would give a two-year mandate for a transitional governance body in Gaza, known as the Board of Peace, and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF). The text says the ISF would be tasked with working with Israel and Egypt to secure border areas, \"ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip\", protecting civilians, and training a new Palestinian police force. It also says the ISF would be authorised to \"use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\". It is understood the draft has not yet been formally sent to other Security Council members for negotiations.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese. Five of the seven dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a hospital official in Gaza City said a man was killed by Israeli fire in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza.The Israeli military said its troops killed a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory, and posed a threat to them.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoGeorge Wright,in London, Virma Rivera,in Manila and Koh Ewe,in SingaporeWatch: Filipino families assess damage after Typhoon KalmaegiAt least 85 people have been killed while hundreds of thousands fled their homes as one of strongest typhoons this year ripped through the central Philippines, authorities say.Typhoon Kalmaegi has flooded entire towns on the most populated central island of Cebu, where at least 49 of the fatalities were located. There are 75 others missing and 17 injured, officials said on Wednesday.Videos show people sheltering on rooftops, while cars and shipping containers have been swept through the streets.The official death toll, which is likely to rise, includes six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island, south of Cebu, after it was deployed to assist in relief efforts.The aircraft went down on Tuesday near Agusan del Sur and was one of four sent to help.\"Communication with the helicopter was lost, which immediately prompted the launch of a search and rescue operation,\" the Philippine Air Force said. Later, a spokeswoman said six bodies had been recovered, believed to be of the pilot and crew.The typhoon, locally named Tino, has weakened since making landfall early on Tuesday, but has continued to bring winds of more than 80mph (130km/h).It is forecast to move across the Visayas islands region and out over the South China Sea by Wednesday.But residents across Cebu province are still reeling from the deadly floods. More than 400,000 people have been displaced by the disaster, according to a report on Wednesday by the national disaster agency.Jel-an Moira Servas, a business owner who lives in Mandaue city, told the BBC that she found herself waist-deep in water within minutes when her house became flooded. She quickly evacuated with her family, bringing only light items like food and electronics.\"Right now, the rain has completely stopped and the sun is out, but our houses are still filled with mud, and everything inside is in shambles,\" she said. \"We don't even know where to start cleaning. I can't even look at it without crying.\"Jel-an Moira ServasJel-an Moira Servas's home in Mandaue city was damaged by heavy flooding during the typhoonRafaelito Alejandro, the deputy administrator at the Office of Civil Defence told local radio station DZMM that the current challenge for rescuers was clearing \"debris and cars on the road\". Carlos Jose Lañas, a volunteer rescuer, told the BBC that despite preparing for the worst case, they were caught off-guard by the extent of the flooding. \"This is the worst flood I've ever experienced,\" the 19-year-old said. \"Almost all the rivers here in Cebu overflowed. Even emergency responders did not expect this kind of scenario.\"\"The rescue operation was too overwhelming for the emergency responders around Cebu, because there were a lot of people asking for help.\"In a Facebook post, Cebu governor Pamela Baricuatro described the disaster as \"unprecedented\".\"We were expecting the winds to be the dangerous part, but... the water is what's truly putting our people at risk,\" she said. \"The floodwaters are just devastating.\"Baricuatro declared a state of calamity in Cebu on Tuesday evening to facilitate disaster relief efforts.Most of the deaths were due to drowning, reports said. The storm has been sending torrents of muddy water down hillsides and into towns and cities.Damage to residential areas on Cebu was extensive, with many small buildings swept away and a thick carpet of mud left by the retreating floodwaters. Rescue teams took to boats to free people who were trapped inside their houses.Don del Rosario, 28, was among those in Cebu City who sought refuge on an upper floor as the storm raged.\"I've been here for 28 years, and this is by far the worst we've experienced,\" he told the AFP news agency.Moment Philippines floods move shipping containersThe Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year.The latest comes barely a month after back-to-back typhoons killed over a dozen people and wrought damage to infrastructure and crops.Super Typhoon Ragasa, known locally as Nando, struck in late September, followed swiftly by Typhoon Bualoi, known locally as Opong.In the months before, an extraordinarily wet monsoon season caused widespread flooding, sparking anger and protests over unfinished and sub-standard flood control systems that have been blamed on corruption.On 30 September, dozens were killed and injured after a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines, with Cebu bearing the brunt of the damage.Typhoon Kalmaegi is forecast to move on to Vietnam, which is already seeing record-breaking rainfall.With additional reporting by Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent",

    "body": "Iran has released two French nationals who were detained there for more than three years, French President Emmanuel Macron has said.Cécile Kohler, 41 and her partner Jacques Paris, 72, have been released from Evin prison, Macron said on Tuesday, with France's foreign minister later confirming they were \"safe\" at the embassy in Tehran \"ahead of their final release\".\"I welcome this first step. The dialogue continues to allow for their return to France as quickly as possible,\" Macron said.The pair, who were arrested in May 2022 during a tourist trip, are believed to be the last French nationals held in Iran.Last month, they were found guilty of spying on behalf of both France and Israel, and were handed lengthy prison sentences, according to Iranian state media reports.A number of Europeans have been held by Iran in recent years. France has accused Iran of state hostage-taking and keeping its nationals in conditions akin to torture, something Tehran has denied. In a statement to the AFP news agency on Tuesday, the pair's Paris-based legal team said the release of Kohler and Paris had \"ended their arbitrary detention which lasted 1,277 days\". AFP said their families have insisted they are wholly innocent.Their freeing comes more than a month after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a deal to exchange French detainees for an Iranian woman held in France was nearly complete. Iran had said Kohler and Paris could be released as part of that agreement.Mahdieh Esfandiari, who has been held in France since February on charges of promoting terrorism on social media, was released conditionally by French authorities last month.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondent\"A moment comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new,\" Zohran Mamdani told a jubilant crowd in New York on Wednesday - quoting India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru's midnight speech of 1947, when the country  awoke to freedom.\"When an age ends and the soul of a nation finds utterance. Tonight we step out from the old to the new,\" Mamdani continued.As Mamdani wrapped up his victory speech, the title track from the 2004 Bollywood hit Dhoom rang out across the hall - followed by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys' Empire State of Mind, now pulsing with new meaning as New York's first Indian-origin mayor made history. Months earlier, Mamdani had turned Bollywood into campaign language, a nod to his  South Asian roots - his mother is filmmaker Mira Nair, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, a Ugandan-born scholar of Indian descent. On Instagram, he's recorded several messages in Hindi, often relying on playful imagery and dialogues from popular Bollywood films.Invoking India's first prime minister on Wednesday was a final flourish.Seventy-seven years ago, Nehru, in a sweltering Constituent Assembly hall in Delhi, had prefaced the lines borrowed by Mamdani with one of the most stirring openings in history: \"Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially.\"\"At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.\"It was just before midnight on 15 August 1947, and India was about to become independent after nearly two centuries of British rule. The words carried both elation and gravity - a promise of responsibility and of a nation finding its voice.Many believe Mamdani's nod to Nehru's speech held out the promise that something new, untested, and potentially transformative had begun in New York.Decades earlier, in another moment of awakening, Nehru had been evoking something far larger - a nation's rebirth.Freedom, Nehru continued, as not an end but a beginning - \"not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving\". The service of India, he insisted, meant serving \"the millions who suffer\" and ending \"poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity\". He pledged that India's work would not be over \"so long as there are tears and suffering\", and urged unity over \"petty and destructive criticism\" to build \"the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell.\"The roughly 1,600-word speech by India's first prime minister has gone down as one of the most famous speeches in history. The New York Times said Nehru had \"electrified his countrymen with a speech of soaring eloquence\". Historian Ramachandra Guha called it a speech \"rich in emotion and rhetoric\". Srinath Raghavan, a historian, told an interviewer that the \"speech still resonates in India because it genuinely captured the moment in the way great speeches can\".There were three main speakers that night: Chaudhry Khaliquz-zaman spoke for India's Muslims, Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher, for his eloquence and vision, and Nehru - the star of the evening.The set-up of Nehru's speech was electric. Time magazine reported that Indian leaders had gathered in the Constituent Assembly Hall an hour before midnight. The chamber was \"ablaze with the colours of India's new tricolour flag - orange, white and green\". Nehru made what the magazine called an \"inspired speech\".What followed was pure theatre of history. \"And as the twelfth chime of midnight died out, a conch shell, traditional herald of the dawn, sounded raucously through the chamber. Members of the Constituent Assembly rose. Together they pledged themselves at this solemn moment . . . to the service of India and her people.\"Outside, Indians were rejoicing. In his book India After Gandhi, Guha quotes an American journalist reporting: \"Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs were happily celebrating together... It was Times Square on New Year's Eve. More than anyone else, the crowd wanted Nehru.\"But beneath the euphoria, chaos and violence were already stirring. Across the subcontinent, religious riots broke out. Two days later, the borders were drawn - triggering one of history's largest and bloodiest migrations, as up to 15 million people moved and about a million died.Amid the upheaval, Nehru's words stood out - a reminder of India's unfulfilled promise, and of a leader whose command of language many believe matched the enormity of the moment.By then, Nehru had gained a reputation as a formidable orator, delivering extempore speeches that ranged effortlessly across politics, science, art, and ethics. As Australian diplomat Walter Crocker observed, the breadth and spontaneity of his addresses were \"without parallel\". As he concluded his most famous speech in August 1947, Nehru said: \"We have hard work ahead. There is no resting for any one of us till we redeem our pledge in full, till we make all the people of India what destiny intended them to be.\"Seven decades later, in New York, Mamdani has his own, rather different work cut out for him.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMadeline HalpertNew York CityWatch: Joy precedes scrutiny, reports Nada Tawfik from inside Mamdani's victory partyZohran Mamdani, 34, has won New York City's race for mayor in a contest that rallied young voters and sparked debate about the future direction of the US Democratic Party.Ugandan-born Mamdani, a Democrat, beat former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, to become the youngest person in over a century to lead the largest city in the US.\"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" the self-described democratic socialist told the crowd during a victory speech.Democrats also won governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in California voters backed a proposition to redraw the congressional electoral map ahead of next year's midterm elections. Mamdani made affordability the central message of his campaign, pledging to expand social programmes paid for by new taxes on high earners and corporations.In New York, he was a relatively unknown member of the state assembly until his campaign gained online momentum a few months ago, propelling him to victory in the Democratic primary contest over the summer.Mamdani has become the first South Asian and Muslim to lead the city. In his victory speech, he spoke of a \"new age\".\"For as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well-connected that power does not belong in their hands,\" Mamdani said. \"The future is in our hands,\" he said, pledging to create a government that works \"for everyone\".Mamdani's campaign has drawn significant national attention, including from US President Donald Trump, who in the days before the vote threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani won. The president calls Mamdani a communist - a label that Mamdani rejects.In overnight projections from BBC news partner CBS, Mamdani had secured 50.3% of the vote, compared with Cuomo's 41.6%. Republican Curtis Sliwa had just over 7%. Shortly after the winner was projected, Sliwa conceded.\"We have a mayor-elect,\" Sliwa told a group of supporters. \"Obviously I wish him good luck, because if he does well, we do well.\"Cuomo also conceded, congratulating Mamdani despite a chorus of boos from his supporters. But Cuomo highlighted that almost half of New Yorkers who voted had not picked Mamdani, and said his opponent had made \"promises that cannot be met\".There are questions over how Mamdani will pay for his ambitious social agenda and critics have questioned how a politician with no executive experience will handle a hostile Trump administration.On Tuesday night, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson criticised the \"consequences\" of New York City's choice on social media platform X. \"Zohran Mamdani's election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party,\" he wrote.The president also posted on social media, blaming the shutdown, and his not appearing on the ballot, for Republican losses Tuesday night. Other Democratic wins - and California redraws voting boundariesCentrist Democrats clinched victories in elections for governor on Tuesday night, with Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill winning races to run the states of Virginia and New Jersey respectively.The races were being viewed as an indication of how Americans were feeling about the national government's policies, although the latter state is reliably blue.Voters in California also approved a measure to redraw political lines to favour Democrats, in response to similar efforts by conservative-led states in a nationwide battle for control of the US House of Representatives.The redistricting measure, called Prop 50, was aimed at reconfiguring the state's voting districts to give Democrats better chances at taking five seats in the US House of Representatives from Republicans during next year's midterm elections.Whether the measure will tip the balance of power in Washington remains unclear.Questions for national Democratic PartyMamdani's win in New York presents a dilemma for the Democratic establishment, which has been reluctant to endorse him. Mamdani was nonetheless favoured to win his race, having led his rivals in the polls by double digits for weeks leading up to election day. A relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his journey from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to the frontrunner candidate to lead a city with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.The former New York assemblyman centred his campaign on cost-of-living issues in one of the country's most expensive cities, campaigning on issues like universal child care, and free and faster buses. His candidacy drew criticism from business leaders and centrist Democrats, some of whom did not endorse him, including fellow New Yorker and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans have seized on Mamdani's popularity to paint the future of the Democratic Party as more and more left-leaning - a point that Trump has made during his threats to withhold federal funding to the New York City.",

    "body": "18 hours agoJames GregoryPortuguese Judiciary PoliceThe sub was located 1,000 nautical miles off the coast of LisbonFour people have been detained after Portuguese authorities intercepted a narco-sub carrying more than 1.7 tonnes of cocaine in the mid-Atlantic.The semi-submersible vessel was bound for the Iberian peninsula and was seized in recent days, according to officials.Footage shows the police and navy surrounding the vessel before boarding, seizing the Class A substance and arresting four crew members, who are said to be from South America.The suspects, including two Ecuadorians, a Venezuelan and a Colombian, were remanded in pre-trial custody after their court appearance in the Azores on Tuesday, said police.Vítor Ananias, head of Portugal's police unit to combat drug trafficking, told a press conference that their different nationalities showed the organisation behind them was not just based in one country.The Lisbon-based Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (MAOC) said it had received information in recent days indicating that a criminal organisation was in the process of dispatching a submersible loaded with cocaine destined for Europe.A few days later, a Portuguese ship successfully located the submersible approximately 1,000 nautical miles (1,852km) off the coast of Lisbon, in an operation backed by the UK's National Crime Agency and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.Having seized the vessel, the navy said it could not be towed back to shore due to poor weather and its fragile construction, and it later sank in the open sea.Portuguese navyThe Portuguese navy said the narcosub was too fragile  to be towed to port and ended up sinking in the seaVítor Ananias told reporters that \"between the heat, the vessel's fumes and high waves, with difficult weather conditions, even one day is tricky [for the four men on board]. By the end of 15 or 20 days all you want is to get out\".Such incidents like these had been a \"recurring situation in recent years\", he added, in remarks quoted by Lusa news agency.In March this year, a similar vessel carrying 6.5 tonnes of cocaine was seized about 1,200 nautical miles from Lisbon. It also comes as the Trump administration ramps up its attacks on vessels it says  are being used to smuggle drugs into the US. Three men were killed last week in a US strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Sunday.Experts have questioned the legality of such strikes under international law and they have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted.Watch: Moment Portuguese police enter narco-sub carrying 1.7 tonnes of cocaine in Atlantic",

    "body": "24 hours agoLucy Fleming and Richard KagoeAt least 40 people in Sudan have been killed in a drone strike that targeted a funeral that was taking place outside the army-held city of el-Obeid in North Kordofan state, officials and activists say.They blamed the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for Monday's attack on al-Luweib village as mourners had gathered in a tent. The RSF has not yet commented.Many reportedly died before getting to hospital in el-Obeid, a strategic city that connects the capital, Khartoum, to the western region of Darfur.Fighting has intensified in this oil-rich Kordofan area and around 20,000 people fled to el-Obeid last week after the RSF captured Bara town, 30km (18 miles) north of the city.The town fell at the same time as the city of el-Fasher, which had been the army's last stronghold in Darfur.There have since been reports of mass killings, sexual violence, abductions and widespread looting in el-Fasher by RSF fighters.The UN said summary executions of civilians by RSF fighters had also also been reported in Bara.Such atrocities could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has warned.The RSF leader has promised to investigate \"violations\" but his paramilitary group has denied widespread allegations that the killings in el-Fasher are ethnically motivated and follow a pattern of the Arab paramilitaries targeting non-Arab populations.The ICC's statement came as a global group of food security experts confirmed on Monday that el-Fasher residents were suffering from famine following the RSF's 18-month siege of the city.The UN-accredited Integrated Food Security Phase network (IPC) also said the city of Kadugli in South Kordofan state was in the most catastrophic stage of hunger.The city, nearly 300km south of el-Obeid, has been also surrounded and starved of supplies by the RSF.UN chief António Guterres has called for an immediate halt to the violence in Sudan, warning that the humanitarian crisis is rapidly worsening.\"The horrifying crisis in Sudan... is spiralling out of control,\" he said on the side-lines of a summit in Doha.\"El-Fasher and the surrounding areas... have been an epicentre of suffering, hunger, violence and displacement - and since the Rapid Support Forces entered el-Fasher last weekend, the situation is growing worse by the day,\" AFP news agency quotes him as saying.Guterres urged the army and the RSF to come to the negotiating table and \"bring an end to this nightmare of violence\".A Sudanese government source has told AFP that the authorities are considering a US proposal for a truce.Washington - along with other states - has been pushing for a ceasefire and a roadmap to end the conflict.There have been several rounds of peace talks in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - but they have failed - and both sides have shown an unwillingness to agree to a ceasefire.The North Kordofan Resistance Committee, a volunteer aid group, said the attack on the village, which is 15km east of el-Obeidz, happened on Monday.Mohamed Ismail, North Kordofan's humanitarian aid commissioner, told the Sudan Tribune new website: \"Drones belonging to the Rapid Support Forces militia attacked citizens who were at a funeral, resulting in the death of 40 people and the injury of dozens.\"Last week, the UN said el-Obeid was already struggling to cope with the influx of those fleeing from Bara.Since the civil war erupted between the army and RSF in April 2023, more than 150,000 people have died about 12 million have fled their homes in what the UN has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis.",

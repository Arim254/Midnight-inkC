    "body": "The Spanish town of Terrassa in north-eastern Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters to prevent potentially sinister \"rituals\" during Halloween.All requests for the fostering or adoption of the felines will be denied from 6 October to 10 November to protect them from being hurt or used as props, said the local animal welfare service. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque told broadcaster RTVE that adoption requests for black cats usually increase around Halloween.While black cats are often associated with witchcraft and seen as bad luck in Western culture, many other cultures, including Japan and Egypt, see them as symbols of prosperity and fortune.Terassa's city council said there had been no record of cruelty towards black cats in the town, however there have been incidents in other areas and the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups.\"We try to prevent people from adopting because it's trendy or impulsively. And in cases like these, which we know exist, to prevent any macabre practices,\" Duque said.Terrassa is home to more than 9,800 cats, according to local authorities, and the town's adoption centre houses around 100 felines, 12 of which are black, the Catalan News Agency reported.The city council emphasised that the measure is \"temporary and exceptional\" and represents an extra precaution for animal welfare, but did not rule out repeating the ban in the future.Exceptions during the ban period will be assessed individually by the adoption centre and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.",

    "body": "6 hours agoIan AikmanBBCA large crowd gathered for the players' funeral on SaturdayAfghanistan has pulled out of an upcoming cricket series after three players in a local tournament were killed in an air strike it blamed Pakistan for.The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said it would withdraw from November's tri-nation T20 series out of respect for the dead. The three did not play for the national team.The strike hit a home in Urgon district in Paktika province, where the players were eating dinner after a match, witnesses and local officials told the BBC.Eight people were killed, the ACB said. Pakistan said the strike hit militants and denied targeting civilians. The ACB named the three players who were killed as Kabeer Agha, Sibghatullah and Haroon, calling their deaths \"a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family\".The International Cricket Council (ICC) said it was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" by the \"tragic deaths of three young and promising Afghan cricketers\" in an air strike that also \"claimed the lives of several civilians\".\"The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief,\" it said in a statement, adding that it \"strongly condemns this act of violence\".The attack came hours after a temporary truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan was due to expire following days of deadly clashes on the border between the two nations. Dozens of casualties have been reported.Pakistan said it had targeted Afghan militants in the air strike and that at least 70 combatants had been killed. Pakistan's Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar said claims that the attack targeted civilians are \"false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan\".He rejected the ICC's \"selective, biased and premature comment\", adding it had not cited any \"independent verification to substantiate these claims\". Afghanistan Cricket Board/XThe Afghanistan Cricket Board shared this image of the three players who were killedIn a social media post, Afghan national team captain Rashid Khan paid tribute to the \"aspiring young cricketers who dreamed of representing their nation on the world stage\".Other players for the Afghan national side joined the tributes, including Fazalhaq Farooqi, who said the attack was a \"heinous, unforgivable crime\".On Saturday, large crowds of people were seen gathering at the funeral for the strike's victims.The strike came after Pakistani officials said seven soldiers were killed in a suicide attack near the Afghan border on Friday.The 48-hour truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which began on Wednesday at 13:00 GMT, has reportedly been extended to allow for negotiations.An Afghan delegation arrived in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday for peace talks with the Pakistani side. The Taliban government said it would take part in the talks despite \"Pakistani aggression\", which it says was Islamabad's attempt to prolong the conflict.Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Pakistan should \"reconsider its policies, and pursue friendly and civilised relations\" with Afghanistan.Pakistan's Foreign Office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif would lead the country's delegation in Doha.It said the talks will focus on ending cross-border terrorism and restoring peace and stability on the Pakistan-Afghan border.Zimbabwe will now replace Afghanistan in the T20 series.",

    "body": "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of committing \"murder\" following a strike carried out on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September. In a social media post, Petro accused the US of violating his country's sovereignty and killing a Colombian fisherman.Posting on X, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"It comes after President Donald Trump said the US had struck a \"drug-carrying submarine\" on Thursday, killing two people.Writing on social media, Trump said US intelligence confirmed the vessel was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The attack is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. It is the first time survivors have been reported.Writing about an earlier attack in September, Pedro wrote on X on Saturday that: \"US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters.\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on 15 September when US forces allegedly fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the submarine targeted in the latest attack was \"built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs\". \"This was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine,\" he said, adding that no US military personnel had been injured. The US president also said two people who survived would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.They were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.Narco-subs have become a popular way to transport drugs as they can go largely undetected, and can be sunk after delivery. They are often homemade and constructed using fibreglass and plywood. The US, as well as other coastal nations, have previously intercepted some of these subs.",

    "body": "Chen Ning Yang, Nobel laureate and one of the world's most influential physicists, has died at the age of 103, according to Chinese state media.An obituary released by CCTV cited illness as the cause of death.Yang and fellow theoretical physicist, Lee Tsung-Dao, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their work in parity laws, which led to important discoveries regarding elementary particles - the building blocks of matter. Yang was also a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and an honorary dean of the Institute for Advanced Study at the institution.Born in 1922 in China's eastern Anhui province, he was the oldest of five children and raised on the campus of Tsinghua University where his father was a professor of mathematics.As a teenager, Yang told his parents: \"One day, I want to win the Nobel Prize.\"He achieved that dream at the age of 35, when his work with Lee studying the law of parity earned them the honour in 1957.The Nobel committee praised \"their penetrating investigation... which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\".Yang received his science degree in 1942 from National Southwest Associated University in Kunming, and later completed a master's degree at Tsinghua University.At the end of the Sino-Japanese War, he travelled to the US on a fellowship from Tsinghua and studied at the University of Chicago, where he worked under Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, inventor of the world's first nuclear reactor.Throughout a prolific career, he worked across all areas of physics, but maintained particular interest in the fields of statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.Yang received the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in 1957 and was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Princeton University in 1958.Yang married his first wife Chih Li Tu in 1950, with whom he had three children.After Tu's death in 2003, Yang married his second wife Weng Fan, who is more than 50 years his junior.The pair had first met in 1995 when Weng was a student in a physics seminar, and later reconnected in 2004. At the time, Yang called her his \"final blessing from God\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoIan Aikman andRachel HaganHostages and Missing Families ForumRonen Engel was killed on 7 October, the Israeli military saidThe daughter of one of the latest dead hostages to be returned to Israel from Gaza has said her father is \"finally home\".Ronen Engel's daughter, Mika, wrote on Instagram: \"It's not what we hoped, it's not what we wished for him, but it's finally here.\"The remains of Mr Engel, 54, a photographer, and 30-year-old Thai farm worker Sonthaya Akrasri were the latest to be returned by Hamas on Saturday. Both were killed during the 7 October 2023 attack and their bodies were taken to Gaza, the IDF said. They are the 11th and 12th of 28 dead hostages to be returned under the ceasefire deal.Mr Engel's wife, Karina Engel-Bart, and their teenage daughters were also taken hostage but were released in November 2023 during a truce between Israel and Hamas. The following month, the IDF confirmed that Mr Engel had been killed in captivity.Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that Mr Engel was remembered by loved ones as a man with \"hands of gold and the soul of an artist\".He was a photographer and volunteer ambulance driver for Israel's emergency service Magen David Adom.The second dead hostage returned was identified by Israel on Sunday as Sonthaya Akrasri, a Thai agricultural worker who was killed on 7 October while living at Kibbutz Be'eri. Thailand's foreign ministry announced his death in May 2024.He was the father of a seven-year-old daughter and had planned to return to Thailand to open his own farm, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.Hostages and Missing Families ForumThe delay in the return of the dead hostages has caused outrage in Israel, as the terms of last week's ceasefire deal stipulated the release from Gaza of all hostages - living and dead. Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the remaining bodies under the rubble in Gaza.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has ordered the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to remain closed until further notice, and said its reopening would be considered based on the return of the final hostage remains and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.The Rafah crossing is vital for Palestinians who need medical assistance to leave, and for thousands of others to return.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".But the US has downplayed suggestions that the delay amounts to a breach of the ceasefire deal, which President Donald Trump claimed as a major victory on a visit to Israel and Egypt last week.The text of the deal has not been published, but a leaked version that was seen in Israeli media appeared to account for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult, as air strikes on Gaza have reduced many buildings to rubble, and Israel does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into the territory.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. ReutersHamas says it has been working to recover the remains of dead hostages beneath the rubble left by Israeli attacks on the Gaza StripAlso as part of the deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire. The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza. There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "16 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAfter serving 43 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Subramanyam \"Subu\" Vedam was finally free. New evidence had exonerated him earlier this month of the murder of his former roommate.But before he could reach his family's arms, Mr Vedam was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who want to deport him to India - a country he has not lived in since he was a baby.Now, Mr Vedam's legal team is fighting a deportation order and his family is determined to get him out of custody, for good.His family are now working to navigate a new and \"very different\" situation, his sister Saraswathi Vedam told the BBC. Her brother has gone from a facility where he knew inmates and guards alike, where he mentored fellow inmates, and where he had his own cell, to a facility where he shares a room with 60 men and where his history of good behaviour and mentorship is unknown.Mr Vedam has been repeating one message to his sister and other family members in the wake of the new situation: \"I want us to focus on the win.\"\"My name has been cleared, I'm no longer a prisoner, I'm a detainee.\"The 1980 murderMore than 40 years ago, Mr Vedam was convicted of murdering his once-roommate Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student. Kinser's body was found nine months after he went missing in a wooded area with a bullet wound in his skull. On the day of Kinser's disappearance, Mr Vedam had asked him for a ride. While the vehicle Kinser drove was returned to its usual spot, no one saw it being returned. Mr Vedam was charged with Kinser's murder. He was denied bail, had his passport and green card seized by authorities and was labelled a \"foreigner likely to flee\".Two years later he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offence, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence. Throughout that time, Mr Vedam maintained his innocence on the murder charges. His supporters and family members stressed there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. Getty ImagesMr Vedam's exoneration Mr Vedam repeatedly appealed the murder conviction and a few years ago new evidence in the case surfaced which exonerated. Earlier this month, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna said he would not pursue a new trial against Mr Vedam.But Mr Vedam's family knew there was one hurdle left before he was free: he still had a 1988 deportation order, based on his convictions for murder and a drug offence. The family expected they would have to file a motion to have his immigration case reopened, Ms Vedam said. The facts of the case are different now, she stressed.But when they arrested him, ICE cited the immigration order as their reasoning for quickly detaining him in a different Pennsylvania facility. While he was exonerated for the murder charge, his drug conviction still stands, they have said. The immigration agency said it acted on a lawfully issued order.ICE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but told other US outlets that Mr Vedam will remain in custody pending his deportation. Mr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.\"What was deeply disappointing was that we didn't even have a moment to hold him in our arms,\" Ms Vedam said. \"He was held wrongly and one would think that he conducted himself with such honour and purpose and integrity that that should mean something.\"Potential deportation to IndiaThe family has stressed Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best. While he was born there, he moved to the US at nine months old. What relatives are still alive, are distant ones, Ms Vedam told the BBC.His community - Ms Vedam, her four daughters and other cousins - are in the US and Canada. \"He will again be robbed and miss out on the lives of the people closet to him, by being half way across the world,\" she said. \"It's almost like having his life stolen twice.\"Mr Vedam, who is a legal permanent resident, had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested.

    "body": "22 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemGaza's Hamas-run civil defence says 11 people were killed, all from the same family, after the bus they were in was hit by an Israeli tank shell in northern Gaza.The Abu Shaaban family, it said, were trying to reach their home to inspect it when the incident happened in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday night.This is the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire eight days ago.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.Israeli soldiers continue to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency the victims were killed while \"trying to check on their home\" in the area.The dead included women and children, according to the civil defence.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle.It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.\"Hamas said the family had been targeted without justification.The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control. With limited internet access, many Palestinians do not know the position of Israeli troops as the yellow demarcation line is not physically marked, and it is unclear if the area where the bus was travelling did cross it.The BBC has asked the IDF for coordinates of the incident.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday the army would set up visual signs to indicate the location of the line.In a separate development, Hamas on Friday released the body of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit to the Red Cross, which returned it to Israel.Mr Margalit was the tenth deceased hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people are yet to be repatriated. Israel handed the bodies of 15 more Palestinians over to officials in Gaza via the Red Cross, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the dead hostages' bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

Ohtani also became the first pitcher since the Boston Braves' Jim Tobin in 1942 to hit three home runs in the same game.\"It was really fun on both sides of the ball today,\" said Ohtani, who was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his heroics.\"I'm taking this trophy and let's get four more wins. We won it as a team and this is really a team effort. I hope everybody in LA and Japan and all over the world could enjoy a really good sake [Japanese rice wine].\"Ohtani's entered the game at the Dodger Stadium on the back of an eight-game home run drought, but led from the front as he struck out three batters in the opening frame.He then starred with the bat in a performance which included a crushing 446 foot home run and a monster 469 foot hit which bounced out of the stadium.It marked another historic showing from Ohtani, who last year became the first player ever to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.\"That was probably the greatest post-season performance of all time,\" said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. \"There's a reason why he's the greatest player on the planet. It's kind of whatever you don't expect, expect him to do it.\"This is just a performance that I've just never seen. No-one's ever seen something like this. I'm still in awe right now of Shohei.\"The Dodgers' comfortable victory sets up a World Series showdown against the Toronto Blue Jays or Seattle Mariners, with the latter 3-2 up in the best-of-seven series.",

    "body": "56 minutes agoFrank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent, Jerusalem andPaulin KolaGetty ImagesThe US state department says a Hamas attack on Palestinians would be a ceasefire violationIsrael has launched air strikes in southern Gaza, accusing Hamas of attacks in a \"bold violation of the ceasefire\".A military official said Hamas had carried out \"multiple attacks against Israeli forces beyond the yellow line\" - which they say is the area Israeli troops have withdrawn to in accordance with phase one of the US-brokered deal.Hamas said it was committed to the ceasefire and accused Israel of breaking it several times.The deal - part President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war - came into force on 10 October. The first phase of the agreement currently under way has seen the release of all living hostages as well as the return to Israel of 12 out of 28 of those deceased.For its part, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, as well as returning 15 bodies of Palestinians in return for every Israeli hostage's remains.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not issued a statement on the recent flare-up, but an official said Hamas's attacks included \"an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] shot at a military force, and a sniper fire against a military force\".\"Both of the incidents happened in an Israeli controlled area, east to the yellow line,\" said the official, without giving exact locations.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) still occupy and control just over 50% of the Gaza Strip, having withdrawn to the agreed yellow line.Hamas, which has ruled the territory for 18 years, is facing a challenge from armed groups, such as Abu Shabab's Popular Forces, gangs which it says are being armed and supported by Israel.It has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control in Gaza, according to local sources.Under the Trump 20-point ceasefire, Hamas is supposed to relinquish its weapons so that it no longer poses a threat to Israel. Hamas has accused Israel of funding and arming rival gangs that it says have looted aid trucks. It says Israel is deliberately empowering criminal gangs so as to challenge Hamas's authority and foment chaos. Without the presence of a robust international force in Gaza there is a real risk of further internecine fighting between Palestinian factions. More on the Israel-Gaza warThe attacks in Rafah came hours after the US said it had \"credible reports\" that Hamas was planning an \"imminent\" attack on civilians in Gaza, which, it said, would be a \"direct and grave\" violation of the ceasefire agreement.A planned attack against Palestinians would \"undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts\", the state department said.The statement did not not provide further details. Hamas has strongly denied any planned imminent attack.The state department said it had already informed other guarantors of the Gaza peace agreement - which include Egypt, Qatar and Turkey - and demanded Hamas uphold its end of the ceasefire terms. \"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\" the US statement said.The ceasefire agreement also states that regional partners will ensure that \"Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbours or its people\". Therefore, any instances or evidence of armed action by either Hamas or other factions in Gaza would be considered a violation of the ceasefire.President Donald Trump has previously warned Hamas against the killing of civilians. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier this week.He later clarified that he would not be sending US troops into Gaza.Last week, BBC Verify authenticated graphic videos that showed a public execution carried out by Hamas gunmen in Gaza.Fierce clashes erupted a week ago - involving Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City. Twenty-seven people were killed in what was one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave.",

    "body": "Scientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago.The male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found \"completely preserved\" during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia's far east, a new research paper says.Mursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft.Now, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died.According to the paper, the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were \"robust\" individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood.All showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips. All of the men were suffering from some kind of \"pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives\". DNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area. The paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts. The researchers believe the men were likely victims of the 'Crisis of the Third Century', most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were \"numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne\".The paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area. It notes that mass burials and mass graves were \"not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire\", and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events.Given the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were \"most probably thrown in\" the well before being covered with soil.Mursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identity theft. In a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"The former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023. Santos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported. He served less than three months of a seven-year sentence.\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.In April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"He reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"Prosecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.In his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.Trump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old. \"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month. Santos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.From there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.He was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.A report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.Santos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.Earlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned. The letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"He wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions. \"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. \"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"Santos began serving his sentence in July at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey.Trump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.In May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.He also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.Commutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon.",

    "body": "1 day agoFergus WalshMedical editorA blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis, according to a new study.Results of a trial in North America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three-quarters don't have any form of screening programme.More than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.The Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood. It is currently being trialled by the NHS.The trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year, with nearly one in 100 getting a positive result. For 62% of these cases, cancer was later confirmed.  Lead researcher Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, associate professor of radiation medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said the data showed that the test could \"fundamentally change\" their approach to cancer screening. He explained that it could help detect many types of cancer \"earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest\".The test correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.  When combined with breast, bowel, lung and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.  Crucially, three-quarters of cancers detected were those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach, bladder and pancreatic cancer.The blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in nine out of 10 cases.These impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.But scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.Clare Turnbull, professor of translational cancer genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.\"The topline results are to be released at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Berlin on Saturday, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Much will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.The NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.Sir Harpal Kumar, president of biopharma at Grail called the results \"very compelling\".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"The vast majority of people who die from cancer do so because we find their cancers too late.\"Many cancers are found when they are \"already very advanced\" he added, explaining that the aim is to \"shift to earlier detection, when we have the chance to use treatments that are much more effective and potentially curative\".But Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK cautioned that further research is needed to \"avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm\". \"The UK National Screening Committee will \"play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS,\" he added.",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the bestselling memoir I Want to Die but I Want To Eat Tteokbokki has died at the age of 35.Her 2018 book, a compilation of conversations with her psychiatrist about her depression, was a cultural phenomenon with its themes of mental health resonating with readers across the world.Originally written in Korean, it found international acclaim after its English translation was published in 2022.The details surrounding her death are unclear.Baek donated her organs - her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys - which have helped to save five lives, the Korean Organ Donation Agency said in a statement on Friday.The statement also included comments from her sister, which said that Baek had wanted to \"share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope\".I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018, has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated in 25 countries.The runaway bestseller was celebrated for normalising mental health conversations and its nuanced take on inner struggles - most notably, the author's personal conflict between depressive thoughts and her appreciation for simple joys.\"The human heart, even when it wants to die, quite often wants at the same time to eat some tteokbokki, too,\" goes the book's most famous line. Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.Born in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.Anton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.For a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.A sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.Tributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"Another Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\". \"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "Israel's military has confirmed that the latest remains handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza and returned to Israel are those of a dead hostage. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the returned hostage is Eliyahu Margalit, 75, who was killed on 7 October and his body taken into Gaza from Nir Oz kibbutz.Mr Margalit, who was known to his family and friends as Churchill, is the 10th dead hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people have yet to be repatriated. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Mr Margalit in a statement as \"a cowboy at heart\" who managed a cattle branch and horse stables at Nir Oz for many years.His death was announced by Israel in December 2023, a month after his daughter Nili - who was also taken hostage - was released during a temporary truce.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.On Friday night, the IDF again stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies. UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.He added that aid agencies have \"an enormous job ahead of us to stabilise the situation, to stop the starvation, to get the hospitals open, to get the kids back in school\".\"We've started to do that and we're having an impact already but being here on the ground, it's an overwhelming task,\" he said, speaking from Gaza City.BBC Verify - Aid group suspends Gaza operations after ceasefireUS plays down claims Hamas is violating ceasefire dealAs part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior Trump advisers said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing.The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe that Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Several Palestinians have been reported killed since the ceasefire came into effect. Gaza's Civil Defence, run by Hamas, said on Saturday it had recovered nine bodies all from the same family after a bus was targeted by the IDF in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, in the north, on Friday. It said 11 people were killed in total. The IDF said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle. It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement\".The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control - though the line is not clearly demarcated. The Israeli military continues to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement. Under the next stages of the ceasefire, troops are expected to pull out further. Speaking about his role in brokering the ceasefire, US special envoy Steve Witkoff told CBS News's 60 Minutes programme that President Donald Trump had felt \"like the Israelis were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing\" after it targeted Hamas leaders in an air strike in Qatar in September. Following the strike in Doha, in which five lower-level Hamas members and a Qatari officer were killed, Witkoff said Trump had felt \"it was time to be very strong and stop them [Israel] from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests\".Witkoff, who led the US team at the talks alongside Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said they had felt \"a little bit betrayed\" by the Israeli move.\"We had lost the confidence of the Qataris. And so Hamas went underground, and it was very, very difficult to get to them,\" Witkoff told the US network.Qatar, a key US ally, has played an important mediating role in ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "At least 40 migrants, including children, have died after their boat sank off the coast of Tunisia, in one of the deadliest maritime disasters in the region this year, authorities say. The boat sank off the Mediterranean port of Mahdia in central Tunisia while carrying about 70 migrants, an official said. All the people on board were from sub-Saharan Africa, the official added, without providing further details.This is the latest disaster to hit migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean from Africa to Europe.Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, while nearly 2,000 lost their lives at sea.About 30 migrants were rescued in the latest disaster which occurred on Wednesday. Tunisian authorities have opened an investigation into the causes and circumstances surrounding the boat's sinking.The country is facing growing pressure to manage migrants fleeing conflict and poverty in search of better opportunities in Europe.The sea migration route between Africa and Europe is one of the most dangerous in the world. Last February, a boat sank off the Tunisian city of Sfax with more than 40 Sudanese people on board. In 2023, the European Union (EU) signed a deal with Tunisia to tackle irregular migration.The deal includes $118m (£90m) to stop smuggling, strengthen borders and return migrants.",

    "body": "16 hours agoStephen McDonell,China correspondent and Joel GuintoReutersZhang Shengmin heads anti-corruption efforts in the army and is seen as a trusted loyalist of President XiThe Chinese Communist Party has named a veteran who has overseen anti-corruption efforts in the military to be the country's second highest ranking general, just days after nine generals were expelled in a major purge.The appointment of Zhang Shengmin as second-ranked vice chairman of the Central Military Commission was announced at the end of a four-day Central Committee meeting.Zhang becomes the third highest official in the country's top military body, after the first-ranked vice chairman and President Xi Jinping.The nine expelled generals were suspected of serious financial crimes, China's defence ministry said last week. However, analysts said it could also be seen as a political purge.Their removal marked one of the Chinese Communist Party's largest public crackdowns on the military in decades.For months, the Central Military Commission has signalled that it would conduct a crackdown. In July, it issued new guidelines calling for the elimination of \"toxic influence\" in the military and listing out \"iron rules\" for cadres.The crackdown follows smaller-scale public purges of other military officials in recent years, including former defence ministers Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu.Following his promotion Zhang, 67, will serve with another more senior vice chair, Zhang Youxia, on the Central Military Commission.He is a general from the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force and has been serving as deputy secretary of the Central Military Commission's anti-corruption arm.He comes from the central province of Shaanxi and joined the army in 1978.Getty ImagesThe appointment comes after one of the Chinese Communist Party's largest public crackdowns on the military in decades.During the four-day meeting that ended Thursday, the party's Central Committee also approved a new five-year-plan – a broad document to guide its priorities.The plan emphasised \"scientific and technological self-reliance\", something Chinese tech companies will need if the Trump Administration continues to restrict access to computer chips and advanced software.The document also called for \"accelerating the green transition\" and \"modernising defence\" as well as boosting domestic consumption to make up for lost export revenue, during a time of geopolitical uncertainty.",

    "body": "4 hours agoDearbail Jordan and Chris GrahamEU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years on Thursday night - but stopped short of releasing billions of euros in frozen Russian cash to help fund the country's defence. A decision to use €140bn (£122bn) in Russian assets held in a Belgian clearing house was pushed back until December after concerns were raised by Belgium. The controversial move would be on top of sanctions the block has imposed on Russia - the latest on Thursday targeting the Kremlin's oil revenues.The Brussels meeting came ahead of a London summit on Friday, where Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will urge European leaders to boost long-range missile supplies to Kyiv.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to attend the meeting of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\", along with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Netherlands' Dick Schoof. Other leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron will join virtually.On Thursday, European ministers held talks in Brussels about how billions of euros worth of frozen Russian cash could be made available to Ukraine as a so-called \"reparations loan\".Many EU governments had hoped the leaders would back the plan and request the European Commission, the EU's executive body, to work out a formal legal proposal in the coming weeks.But the final text, adopted after marathon talks, stopped short of greenlighting plans. Instead, it asked the Commission for \"options for financial support based on an assessment of Ukraine's financing needs\".\"Russia's assets should remain immobilised until Russia ceases its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates it for the damage caused by its war,\" the declaration added. The aim is now for EU leaders to reach a deal in December. \"This is a topic that is certainly not trivial. It's very complex,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after the summit. \"It was also very clear there are points to be clarified.\"Antonio Costa, European Council President, sounded a positive note, saying the bloc had \"committed to ensure that Ukraine's financial needs will be covered for the next two years\".\"Russia should take good note of this: Ukraine will have the financial resources it needs to defend itself,\" he told a news conference.Zelensky, who was in Brussels for the summit, welcomed the outcome as a signal of \"political support\" for the notion of using Russian assets to keep Kyiv in the fight.There are a number of legal complexities surrounding using Russia's money. Belgium, in particular, has been reluctant to back using the frozen assets, as it is nervous about having to shoulder any potential consequences should Russia legally challenge Euroclear, the clearing house where the money is located.Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said his country needed concrete and solid guarantees before supporting the plan, pointing out the plan was \"unchartered territory\".The Belgian government has argued it could expose Euroclear to litigation and ultimately create a major financial crisis.\"Can this (plan) be legal? That is a very good question ... There are no clear answers,\" De Wever said. \"We will in any case be buried in litigation. That seems like a certainty.\"Russia has criticised the EU's proposals.\"Any confiscatory initiatives from Brussels will inevitably result in a painful response,\" said Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.The EU's latest sanctions followed US measures against Russia's oil industry - the first time Donald Trump has sanctioned Moscow as he grows frustrated over Vladimir Putin's refusal to end the war.After the US sanctions were announced on Wednesday evening, Trump confirmed that a planned meeting with the Russian president in Budapest had been shelved indefinitely.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" he said.The US sanctions targeted Russia's oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil. In response, Putin said the \"unfriendly\" US measures \"will have certain consequences, but they will not significantly affect our economic well-being\".Oil is one of Russia's biggest exports. Ukraine wants to use long-range missiles to target Russian oil and energy plants.Zelensky had hoped to secure Tomahawk cruise missiles from the US but last week Trump refused the request because the weapons are \"highly complex\" and take a year of intense training to use.The EU's latest punitive measures against Russia targeted three Chinese businesses, including two oil refineries and an energy trader, that are \"significant buyers of Russian crude oil\".The measures are \"meant to deprive Russia of the means to fund this war,\" said  Kallas as well as send a message, specifically that \"Russia can't outlast us,\" she said.  China condemned the decision, which a commerce ministry spokesperson said \"seriously undermined the overall framework of China–EU economic and trade co-operation\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterReutersChangpeng Zhao, founder of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has been pardoned by US President Donald Trump.Zhao, also known as \"CZ\", was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 after pleading guilty to violating US money laundering laws.Binance also pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay $4.3bn (£3.4bn) after a US investigation found it helped users bypass sanctions.The pardon reignited debate over the White House embrace of cryptocurrency as the Trump family's own investments in the industry have deepened.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution under the Biden administration part of a \"war on cryptocurrency\", pushing back on critics who said the pardon appeared motivated by Trump's personal financial interests. \"This was an overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration,\" she said, adding that the case had been \"thoroughly reviewed\". \"So the president wants to correct this overreach of the Biden administration's misjustice and he exercised his constitutional authority to do so.\"Binance had spent nearly a year pursuing a pardon for its former boss, who completed his four-month prison sentence in September 2024, the WSJ reported on Thursday.Its campaign came as Trump, who released his own coin shortly ahead of his inauguration in January, promised to take a friendlier approach to the industry than his predecessor.Since then, he has loosened regulations, sought to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve and pushed to make it easier for Americans to use retirement savings to invest in digital assets.Zhao, who stepped down as Binance chief executive in 2023, wrote on social media on Thursday that he was \"deeply grateful for today's pardon and to President Trump for upholding America's commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice\".The pardon lifts restrictions that had stopped Zhao from running financial ventures, but it's not yet clear whether it changes his standing with US regulators or his ability to lead Binance directly.In a statement Binance called the decision \"incredible news\". The exchange, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, remains the world's most popular platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.It did not respond to further questions about the conflict of interest claims.Before the pardon, Zhao's companies had partnered with firms linked to Donald Trump on new digital-currency projects including Dominari Holdings, where his sons sit on the board of advisers and which is based in Trump Tower.The Wall Street Journal also previously reported representatives of the Trump family - which has its own crypto firm World Liberty Financial - had recently held talks with Binance.The Trump administration previously halted a fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, after his investments in the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. He has also pardoned founders of the crypto exchange BitMex, who also faced charges related to money laundering, and Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road, the dark web marketplace known as a place for drug trade.Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale wrote on social media that he loved Trump but the president had been \"terribly advised\" on pardons.\"It makes it look like massive fraud is happening around him in this area,\" he said.Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, blasted the decision in a statement as a \"kind of corruption\".Asked about the decision to pardon Zhao on Thursday, Trump appeared not to not know who he was.\"Are you talking about the crypto person?\" he asked, later saying he had granted the pardon at the \"request of a lot of good people\".When US officials announced the Binance guilty plea in 2023, they said Binance and Zhao were responsible for \"wilful violations\" of US laws, which had threatened the financial system and national security.\"Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,\" said then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\"Its wilful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.\"Zhao stepped down as Binance chief executive as part of the resolution of the case, writing at the time that resigning was \"the right thing to do\". \"I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,\" he said.Reporting contributed by Bernd Debussman Jr",

    "body": "22 hours agoOlga Ivshina, Anastasia Platonova and Yaroslava Kiryukhina,BBC RussianHead of Belgorod region press officeFirefighters trying to put out a vehicle fire after a drone strike on Belgorod, RussiaResidents of Russia's Belgorod region say blackouts, air-raid sirens and the sound of gunfire aimed at incoming Ukrainian drones are becoming increasingly common, as Kyiv retaliates against repeated bombardments of its cities with cross-border strikes of its own.\"It's so loud and so terrifying,\" says Nina, a Belgorod resident who asked us to change her name.\"I was coming back from the clinic when a siren went off. As usual, I received Telegram alerts about a drone attack. Then bursts of automatic gunfire broke out, I ran into a nearby courtyard and tried to hide under an arch,\" she recalls.\"The next day it all happened again - air defence fire, automatic gunfire, explosions.\"The number of Ukrainian drone attacks on the Belgorod region has increased nearly fourfold since the start of 2025, according to BBC News Russian analysis based on data from local authorities.In September, more than 4,000 Ukrainian drones were recorded in the Belgorod region, compared with around 1,100 in January 2025. In one of the biggest strikes last month, the region was attacked with more than 260 drones, according to the governor. There has also been an increase in missile attacks since the summer.Ukraine continues to suffer far greater losses from Russia's near-daily missile and drone strikes, which routinely kill civilians and leave cities across the country without power and heat. At least seven people were killed, including two children, in Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight into Wednesday, and there are fears that the coming winter may be the harshest yet for Ukraine.DSNS UkraineSeveral people were killed on Wednesday in Russian strikes on Kyiv and the surrounding regionUkrainian authorities say the recent surge of attacks on Belgorod, some of which have caused huge blackouts, is a direct result of Russia's latest onslaught on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\"Maybe they should stop being too comfortable there in Belgorod?\" Zelensky said earlier this month. \"They must understand: if they want to leave us without power, then we will do the same\".Belgorod region is a key logistics corridor and staging hub for Russian forces near the border with Ukraine. It is also a regular point of origin for artillery and short-range drone strikes.Although there were local electricity outages in smaller towns in the region earlier in the war, the city of Belgorod was largely unaffected by power cuts until this autumn.Local student Ekaterina (not her real name) told the BBC she was at home in the city on the evening of 28 September, when notifications started appearing on her phone: \"Missile alert! Take shelter!\"The sound of howling sirens followed, and the lights in her flat started flickering.\"We ran to the corridor, because the explosions started almost immediately. They were very loud. The lights blinked and went out,\" Ekaterina recalls.Neighbourhoods of Belgorod lost power after a missile strike and power cut in OctoberMissiles had hit the main Belgorod heat and power plant and a substation, local Telegram channels reported.And while the city centre had its electricity back relatively quickly, some in the suburbs were left without power until morning. Across the region, around 77,000 people, or 5% of the population, still had no electricity the next day.\"While you're in the office in the centre, you wouldn't necessarily notice that there was a blackout. But when you're going home it's like entering a whole different world,\" another Belgorod resident Natalya (not her real name) tells the BBC. \"Complete darkness outside. Apartment blocks are without power, the shops are dark too. As you ride through the darkness, it's hard to tell where your stop is - you can't see anything\".Another big blackout came less than a week later.Authorities admit they do not have the capacity to provide everyone with back-up generators and have called on residents to buy their own.\"But what are we suppose to fuel them with, given the fuel crisis?\" Maria, an elderly resident who also asked to change her name, tells the BBC.More than half of Russia's regions, including Belgorod, have been affected by petrol and diesel shortages, due to increased Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries.Surge in Ukrainian attacks on oil refineries sparks Russian fuel shortages\"And the prices for generators have shot up as well,\" Maria says.Ukraine has increased production of its \"Darts\" drone - lightweight and cheap models that can carry a 4kg (9lb) warhead - and many Belgorod residents say this is the reason the strikes have become more frequent. The drones are effective both for single and mass launches which can potentially overload air defence systems.But the recent strikes on energy infrastructure that caused the blackouts in Belgorod are more likely to have involved heavier weapons. Reports say long-range Himars rockets or Morok drones with larger warheads might have been used.Head of Belgorod region press officeBelgorod has introduced mobile armed units to try to shoot down dronesAnd while for many in Russia the war still seems far away, residents of Belgorod region now feel its impact daily, like Ukrainians over the border.\"Until September, the war seemed to have faded into the background again. But now we are getting constant reminders - through power outages, fuel shortages, and a general sense of anxiety\", says Yakov, who declined to give his real name. \"I personally have a strong feeling that, by continuing the war, Russia is racing headlong toward the abyss\".Additional reporting by Ilya Abishev",

    "body": "The decades-old exemption that lets Trump fast-track White House rebuild13 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Bernd Debusmann JrGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump plans to knock down the entire \"existing structure\" of the White House East Wing to construct a new ballroom - despite previous assurances that the addition would \"not interfere with the current building\". The sight of demolitions has sparked an uproar from Democrats as well as conservation groups, including the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which wrote a letter calling on Trump to hold a public review process. As a former property developer, Trump has extensive experience of navigating planning restrictions, and has occasionally found himself on a collision course with campaigners objecting to his plans.Under a nearly-60-year-old law, the White House and several other notable buildings are exempt from a key historic preservation rule - though one expert told the BBC that presidents typically follow it anyway. Full story: Trump says 'existing structure' to be torn downWho is paying for Trump's new ballroom?Watch: How Trump's comments on East Wing demolition evolvedWhat does the law say?Trump's renovation appears to be the biggest in decades, but the president of the US does have the power to make those changes. And he is not the first to reconstruct the White House. Over the years, a host of presidents have made renovations, from a bowling alley to an indoor swimming pool. Under a law known as National Historic Preservation Act, federal agencies are required to examine the impact of any construction projects on historic properties. Specifically, Section 106 requires the agencies to undergo a review process, including getting input from the public. Then-President Lyndon B Johnson signed the law in 1966, after a period of rapid development in the US - including through federally-funded infrastructure projects - as concerns grew that cultural and historical landmarks were being destroyed. Why is the White House exempt? According to Section 107 of the act, three buildings and their grounds are exempt from the Section 106 review process: the White House, the US Capitol and the US Supreme Court building. In the past, however, typically presidents have voluntarily submitted their plans to the National Capital Planning Commission - which oversees federal building construction - before the construction project begins. Trump officials have not yet done so, but say they plan to, though the renovation has already begun. What's the precedent?Priya Jain, the chair of a heritage preservation committee at the Society of Architectural Historians, told the BBC that the process laid out by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was well established and would have been the \"best practice\" for Trump's East Wing renovation. These reviews - which can take years - involves discussions about programmatic requirements and potential alternatives.\"In this case, it would have been: do we need such a big ballroom? Should it be smaller?\" said Jain, a professor of architecture at Texas A&M University. \"Could it be an extension of the East Wing? Could it have been submerged?\"At stake, she said, is the \"history\" that the building contains. All the additions to the White House over time have added to how the public understands the building and the country at that point in time, she said. \"It's the memory,\" she said. \"The East Wing is 83 years old. It has assumed a historical importance of its own. I haven't seen much out there about how that was assessed.\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East Correspondent, Jerusalem and David GrittenRubio: An Israeli annexation of West Bank would threaten peace dealUS Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have criticised a move by Israel's parliament towards annexation of the occupied West Bank.On Wednesday, far-right politicians in the Knesset took the symbolic step of giving preliminary approval to a bill applying Israeli law in the territory, which the Palestinians claim as part of a hoped-for independent state.At the end of a trip to Israel, Vance branded it a \"very stupid political stunt\". Rubio warned before flying to Israel that annexation would threaten President Donald Trump's plan to end the conflict in Gaza.Israel's prime minister called the move a \"deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord\".A statement from Benjamin Netanyahu's office stressed that his right-wing Likud party and its ultra-Orthodox coalition partners did not vote for the bill, \"except for one disgruntled Likud member who was recently fired from the chairmanship of a Knesset committee\".\"Without Likud support these bills are unlikely to go anywhere,\" it added.The prime minister's office put out the statement in English after Vance was asked about the vote by reporters before he boarded his plane at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport.\"If it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult,\" he said. \"The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel.\"\"That will continue to be our policy. If people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that. But we certainly weren't happy about it.\"Time magazine also published an interview with President Trump in which he insisted that annexation would not happen \"because I gave my word to the Arab countries.\"\"Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,\" he added.ReutersIsrael has built about 160 settlements across the occupied West BankIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice last year.Prime Minister Netanyahu has previously spoken in support of annexing West Bank land but has not advanced this due to the risk of alienating the US - Israel's most important ally - and Arab countries which have built relations with Israel after decades of enmity. Ultra-nationalists in Netanyahu's governing coalition have repeatedly called for Israel to annex the West Bank outright, though the bill was put forward by MPs outside the government.The bill passed in a 25-24 vote. It is unclear whether it has support to win a majority in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament), and there are ways the prime minister can delay or defeat it.The bill will now be discussed by the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee and would have to pass three more readings to become law.The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Knesset's move, saying Israel would have no sovereignty over Palestinian land.ReutersBefore leaving for Israel on Wednesday night, Rubio said annexation would be \"counterproductive\" for Trump's Gaza peace plan - reiterating US opposition to annexation.\"I think the president's made clear that's not something we'd be supportive of right now. And we think it's even threatening to the peace deal,\" he said.His visit on Thursday comes hot on the heels of trips by Vance and two US special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as the Trump administration attempts to push for the start of talks on the second critical phase of his 20-point Gaza peace plan.The first phase - which includes a ceasefire, the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces and an influx of aid - came into effect earlier this month.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaching the agreement over deadly incidents, but it has so far held.Rubio voiced similar optimism to that of Vance for preserving the ceasefire.\"Every day there'll be threats to it, but I actually think we're ahead of schedule in terms of bringing it together, and the fact that we made it through this weekend is a good sign,\" he said.The second phase of the peace plan would involve setting up an interim government in Gaza, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.The war in Gaza began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.In the ensuing conflict, more than 68,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.Additional reporting by Chris GrahamMore on this story",

    "body": "What we know about arrests in FBI's illegal gambling investigation5 hours agoNadine YousifGetty ImagesTerry Rozier of the Miami Heat is among those who were arrested as part of a multi-year investigation into alleged fraud involving NBA players and organised crime.US authorities announced several high-profile arrests on Thursday, including of a star player and a coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA), for alleged illegal sports betting. Among those in custody are Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, both of whom were reportedly arrested after their teams' games on Wednesday. The arrests are part of a sweeping investigation into illegal gambling that produced two indictments, the FBI said — one into players who are allegedly faking injuries to influence betting odds, and another involving an illegal poker ring tied to organised crime.Here is what we know about the cases.What are the allegations? FBI Director Kash Patel described the allegations to reporters as \"mind-boggling\".They include indictments in two major cases, officials said, both involving fraud.The first case is called \"operation nothing but bet,\" in which players and associates allegedly used insider information to manipulate wagers on major sports betting platforms.Follow live updatesIn some cases, players altered their performance or took themselves out of games to ensure those bets were paid out, according to New York City police commissioner Jessica Tisch. Those bets amounted to tens of thousands of dollars in profits.The second case is more complex in nature, officials said, and involved four of the five major crime families in New York as well as professional athletes.The accused in that case are alleged to have participated in a scheme to rig illegal poker games and steal millions of dollars.They did so using \"very sophisticated\" technology including off-the-shelf shuffling machines, special contact lenses and eye glasses to read pre-marked cards, according to authorities. They also used an X-ray table that could read cards that were face down. The victims were allegedly lured to play in these games with former professional athletes, who acted as \"face cards\" in the scheme. The victims were unaware that everyone, including the dealer and the other players, were in on the scam. Authorities said they began probing these poker games in 2019, spanning multiple locations including the Hamptons, Las Vegas, Miami and Manhattan.The accused allegedly laundered profits via bank wires and crypto currencies. They are also alleged to have committed acts of violence, including a robbery at gunpoint and extortion against victims.Both schemes amounted to tens of millions of dollars in theft and robbery across several years and 11 states, authorities said.FBI director announces schemes involving NBA players and Mafia familiesWhich players have been arrested?All in all, authorities say 34 defendants were indicted on charges related to the two fraud cases.Six were charged in the first case of players allegedly faking injuries to influence betting odds, including Miami Heat player Rozier. New York police commissioner Jessica Tisch said that in March 2023, Rozier, then playing for the Charlotte Hornets, allegedly let others close to him know that he planned to leave a game early with a supposed injury.Members of the group then used that information to place fraudulent bets and cash out big, she said. Commissioner Tisch said on Thursday after Rozier's arrest that his \"career is already benched, not for injury but for integrity\".Former NBA player Damon Jones was also arrested. He is said to have been involved in two games that were allegedly part of the scheme, when the Los Angeles Lakers met the Milwaukee Bucks in February 2023, and a January 2024 game between the Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder.Authorities identified a total of seven NBA games between February 2023 and March 2024 that were part of the case:9 February, 2023 – Los Angeles Lakers v Milwaukee Bucks23 March, 2023 – Charlotte Hornets v New Orleans Pelicans24 March, 2023 – Portland Trail Blazers v Chicago Bulls6 April, 2023 – Orlando Magic v Cleveland Cavaliers15 January, 2024 – Los Angeles Lakers v Oklahoma City Thunder26 January, 2024 – Toronto Raptors v Los Angeles Clippers20 March, 2024 – Toronto Raptors v Sacramento KingsThe second case related to illegal poker games involved a total of 31 defendants, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Billups, who was inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame last year.Authorities said three of the accused were charged in both cases.Thirteen members and associates of the Bonanno, Genovese and Gambino crime families in New York were also indicted in the illegal poker case.The charges include robbery, extortion, wire fraud, bank fraud and illegal gambling.The defendants have been arrested and are due to appear in court later on Thursday, authorities said. They are expected to be arraigned in a Brooklyn, New York, court at a later date. What has the NBA said about the allegations?In a statement on Thursday, the NBA said it is in the process of reviewing the federal indictments that were announced and that it is co-operating with authorities.The league added that Rozier and Billups are being placed \"on immediate leave\" from their teams. \"We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,\" the statement said.Who are New York's notorious 'Five Families'?Authorities said the alleged scheme involved four of the five well-known crime families of New York.The Five Families - the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese - have ruled the city's Italian American mafia since 1931.Major mob takedowns reduced the prevalence of mafia activity in the 1990s, aided by the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and then-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. But, as Thursday's indictments show, the mafia has not entirely gone away.The Five Families are part of the larger American-Sicilian mafia operation known as La Cosa Nostra, which translates to \"this thing of ours\", and the members often work closely with their counterparts in Sicily.On the Italian side, the gangsters consider New York City to be a \"gym\" where their members go to be toughened up, criminology professor and modern organised crime expert Anna Sergi, previously told BBC.",

    "body": "10 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia EditorSputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via Reuters and ReutersOne week ago I had the distinct feeling it was Groundhog Day, or as the Russians call it, Dyen Surka.Amid US threats to pressure Moscow - by supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine - Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump held a telephone call. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Budapest.Last August, amid threats of additional US sanctions against Russia, Putin met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Alaska.Déjà vu.But Groundhog Day seems to be over.The Alaska meeting went ahead, with minimal preparation and little result.But the Budapest summit is off. It barely had time to be \"on\", to be fair. Now President Trump has cancelled it.\"It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get,\" the US president told reporters.And that's not all.Previously, Trump had not followed through on threats of more pressure on Russia, preferring carrots to sticks in his dealings with the Kremlin.For the moment he has put his carrots away. Instead he's imposed sanctions on two major Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. That's unlikely to force a U-turn on the war from President Putin. But it's a sign of Trump's frustration with the Kremlin's unwillingness to make any compromise or concessions to end the fighting in Ukraine.Trump says Putin talks 'don't go anywhere' as he imposes new sanctionsWhat's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?The Russians don't take kindly to sticks.On Thursday, President Putin told reporters that the new US sanctions were an \"unfriendly act\" and an attempt to put pressure on Russia.\"But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decide anything under pressure.\"Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was less diplomatic.\"The USA is our enemy and their talkative 'peacemaker' has now fully set on the path to war with Russia,\" he wrote on social media. \"The decisions that have been taken are an act of war against Russia.\"Thursday morning's edition of the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets was slightly less dramatic, but obviously unflattering. The paper criticised \"the capriciousness and fickleness of [Russia's] main negotiating partner.\"So what's changed?Instead of rushing off to summit no. 2, as he had done for summit no.1, this time around President Trump was slightly more cautious. He had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lay the groundwork for the summit with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to make sure there was a point in decamping to Budapest.It soon became clear that there wasn't, and that a new summit now was unlikely to produce a breakthrough. Russia is fiercely opposed to Donald Trump's idea of freezing the current battle lines in Ukraine. The Kremlin is determined to take control, at the very least, of the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It has seized and occupied much of it. But President Volodymyr Zelensky is refusing to cede to Russia those parts of the Donbas that Ukraine still controls.ReutersMembers of Russia's National Guard patrol Red Square near St. Basil's Cathedral in central Moscow on 23 OctoberMoscow would have welcomed a second US-Russia summit. The first, in Alaska, was a diplomatic and political coup for the Kremlin. The red-carpet welcome in Anchorage for President Putin symbolised Russia's return to the international stage and the West's failure to isolate Moscow. Over the last week Russian state media have been savouring the idea of a summit with President Trump in Europe, but without the European Union at the table. Russian commentators portrayed the proposed meeting in Budapest as a slap in the face for Brussels.At the same time, few here seemed to believe that, even if it went ahead, the Budapest summit would produce the kind of result Moscow wanted. Some Russian newspapers have been calling for the Russian army to continue fighting.\"There isn't a single reason Moscow should agree to a ceasefire,\" declared Moskovsky Komsomolets yesterday.That doesn't mean the Kremlin doesn't want peace.It does. But only on its terms. And right now those are unacceptable to Kyiv and, it would appear, to Washington. Those terms involve more than just territory. Moscow is demanding that what it calls the \"root causes\" of the Ukraine war be addressed: an all-encompassing phrase with which Russia broaden its demands to include a halt to Nato enlargement eastwards. Moscow is also widely believed to retain the goal of forcing Ukraine back into Russia's orbit.Is Donald Trump ready to increase the pressure on Russia even more?Possibly.But it's also possible we may wake up one morning and find ourselves back in Groundhog Day.\"In the game of Trump tug-of-war, Russia is leading again,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets after the Budapest summit had been announced. \"In the couple of weeks before the meeting in Budapest, Trump will be pulled in the opposite direction by telephone calls and visits from Europe. Then Putin will pull him back to our side again.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoFavour NunooBBC Africa, AccraGhana's former First Lady Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings has died at the age of 76.She was the widow of Ghana's longest-serving leader, Jerry John Rawlings, who died five years ago.He led two coups before twice being elected president in multiparty polls.Social media is awash with tributes to the former first lady, politician and women's rights advocate, who Ghanaian presidential spokesperson Felix Kwakye Ofosu said had died after a short illness on Thursday morning.Her family visited President John Mahama in the afternoon to officially notify him of her death. The president leads the National Democratic Congress (NDC) party, founded by Jerry Rawlings after he took power.Agyeman-Rawlings also had political ambitions - but lost out in her bid to become the NDC's presidential candidate in 2012.  Why Jerry Rawlings divided opinion in GhanaJerry Rawlings: Remembering Ghana's 'man of the people'As first lady, she founded the 31st December Women's Movement to empower women and teach them how to earn money to develop their communities. It was named after the date of her husband's second coup, which took place in 1981.Born in November 1948, Agyeman-Rawlings came from a middle-class family and grew up in the city of Cape Coast.She met her future husband when she became a boarder at the prestigious Achimota School in the capital, Accra.Unlike her husband, she went on to get a university education, studying art and textiles.Jerry Rawlings joined the air force and earned the rank of flight lieutenant in 1978 - a year after the couple were married.It was not long afterwards that Rawlings, aged 32, took power, with his wife said to be one of his most important advisers.Young, glamourous and charismatic, they proved a dynamic if controversial duo in the West African nation. Together they had four children and their eldest - Dr  Zanetor Agyeman-Rawlings - has gone into politics serving as an NDC MP.The former first lady's women's group, initially regarded as an arm of the NDC, is credited with significantly helping women across the country - especially in poorer areas.Her advocacy also influenced national policy and she played a key role in shaping a law in 1989 that guaranteed inheritance rights for women and children.She is also credited with contributing to provisions for gender equality in Ghana's 1992 constitution, which saw the return of multiparty politics.Ghana's parliament has adjourned to mark the former first lady's death as the country prepares to officially mourn one of its most iconic political figures and one who fought for the inclusion of women in politics.",

    "body": "Russian and Belarusian para-athletes will not be at the 2026 Winter Paralympics, despite the International Paralympic Committee lifting its ban on them.Although the IPC oversees the Games, there are four separate governing bodies in charge of the six sports taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.Three of the governing bodies have decided to keep their bans on athletes from the two countries, and although Russia and Belarus are now allowed to compete in ice hockey, the decision came too late for them to take part in qualifying.Both countries were suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus a close ally of Russia.A partial ban - allowing athletes to compete as neutrals - was introduced in 2023.IPC members then voted to lift the suspensions on the two countries at a meeting last month, allowing para-athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete under their own flags.However, the four international federations have now told the IPC \"that, in practice, no athletes from the two nations are likely to qualify for March's Games\".The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), International Biathlon Union (IBU) and World Curling have not lifted their bans, while World Para Ice Hockey has already decided which countries will enter the qualifying tournament for the two remaining places at the Games.\"In the same way that the IPC fully respects the decision of the IPC General Assembly not to maintain the partial suspensions of NPC Belarus and NPC Russia, we also fully respect the decisions of each international federation regarding the sports they govern,\" said IPC president Andrew Parsons.\"The positions of FIS, IBU and World Curling currently mean that athletes and teams from Belarus and Russia cannot compete in their events, making it impossible for them to qualify for the Milano Cortina 2026 Paralympic Winter Games.\"While Belarus and Russia can now compete in Para ice hockey competitions, at this late stage of the qualification cycle, the six teams for November's Paralympic Games qualification tournament have already been determined.\"I hope the focus will now be very much on the outstanding athletes and NPCs that will compete at Milano Cortina 2026 next March, as well as the tremendous transformational legacies the Paralympic Winter Games will create.\"",

The BBC's Mark Lowen was in St Peter's Square as the two prayed, which he described as a \"hugely symbolic moment in theological history\". The Queen was seen at the ceremony wearing white after previously keeping to the dress code of wearing black when meeting the Pope earlier in the day - seen as a sign of respect. The service inside the Sistine Chapel brought together clergy and choirs from both the Catholic Church and the Church of England, of which the King is the supreme governor.",

    "body": "New images show Israeli control line deeper into Gaza than expected15 hours agoBenedict Garman, Emma Pengelly and Matt Murphy,BBC VerifyBBCThe Israeli military is exerting control over more of Gaza than expected from the ceasefire deal with Hamas, a BBC Verify analysis has found.Under the first stage of the deal, Israel agreed to retreat to a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. The divide was marked by a yellow line on maps released by the military and has become known as the \"Yellow Line\".But new videos and satellite images show that markers placed by Israeli troops in two areas to mark the divide have been positioned hundreds of metres deeper inside the strip than the expected withdrawal line.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz - who instructed troops to place the yellow blocks as markers - warned that anyone crossing the line \"will be met with fire\". There have already been at least two deadly incidents near the boundary line.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not address the allegations when approached by BBC Verify, stating simply that: \"IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground.\"There has been a consistent lack of clarity as to where exactly the boundary will be imposed, with three separate maps posted by the White House, Donald Trump and the Israeli military in the run up to the ceasefire agreement which came into force on 10 October. On 14 October the IDF issued the latest version marking the Yellow Line on their online map, which is used to communicate its position to people in Gaza.But in the north, near the al-Atatra neighbourhood, drone footage from the IDF showed that a line of six yellow blocks were up to 520m further inside the Strip than would have been expected from the IDF maps.Footage geolocated by BBC Verify showed workers using bulldozers and diggers to move the heavy yellow blocks and place them along the coastal al-Rashid road.A similar situation was visible in southern Gaza, where a satellite image taken on 19 October showed 10 markers erected near the city of Khan Younis. The line of blocks ranges between 180m-290m inside the Yellow Line set out by the IDF.If these two sections of boundary were typical of how the markers were being placed along the entirety of the line then Israel would be exerting control over a notably larger area than expected from the ceasefire agreement.Multiple analysts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the blocks were intended to create a \"buffer zone\" between Palestinians and IDF personnel. One expert said the move would be consistent with a long-term \"strategic culture\" which seeks to insulate Israel from nearby territories it does not fully control.\"This gives the IDF space to manoeuvre and create a 'kill zone' against potential targets,\" Dr Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London, said.\"Potential targets can be engaged before they reach the IDF perimeter. It is a bit like no man's land that does not belong to anyone – and Israel tends to take that territory from the opponent's chunk not its own.\"Three experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disparity between the markers and the IDF map was an intentional design to warn civilians they are \"approaching an area of increased risk\".Noam Ostfeld, an analyst with the risk consultancy Sibylline, said that some blocks \"seem to be positioned near roads or walls, making them easier to spot\".But a post to X by the Israeli defense minister seemed to suggest that the yellow blocks marked the actual line, warning that \"any violation or attempt to cross the line will be met with fire\".There is already confusion among Gazans over areas where it is safe to go.Abdel Qader Ayman Bakr, who lives near the temporary boundary in the eastern part of Gaza City's Shejaiya district, told the BBC that, despite promises from Israel of clear markings, he had seen none put in place.\"Each day, we can see Israeli military vehicles and soldiers at a relatively close distance, yet we have no way of knowing whether we are in what is considered a 'safe zone' or 'an active danger zone',\" he said.\"We are constantly exposed to danger, especially since we are forced to remain here because this is where our home once stood.\"Since the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF has reported a number of instances of people crossing the Yellow Line. On all occasions the IDF said it fired upon those involved.BBC Verify has obtained and geolocated footage showing the aftermath of one incident on 17 October, which the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said killed 11 civilians - including women and children all reportedly from the same family. The agency said the Palestinians' vehicle was targeted by Israel after crossing the Yellow Line east of Gaza City in the Zeitoun neighbourhood.The footage showed rescue workers inspecting the burnt out remnants of a vehicle and covering a nearby badly-mangled body of a child with a white sheet. BBC Verify geolocated the video to a spot around 125m over the Yellow Line marked on maps by the IDF.The IDF said warning shots were fired towards a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the line. The statement added when the vehicle failed to stop troops opened fire \"to remove the threat\".Israel Defense Forces (IDF)Meanwhile, the legal status of the boundary has also been questioned.\"Israel's obligations under the law of armed conflict do not cease even for those breaching the Yellow Line,\" said Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, professor of Public International Law at the University of Bristol.\"It can only target enemy fighters or those directly participating in hostilities, and in so doing it must not cause excessive civilian harm.\"In a statement, an Israeli military spokesperson said: \"IDF troops under the Southern Command continue to operate to remove any threat to the troops and to defend the civilians of the State of Israel.\"They added that the concrete blocks are \"being placed every 200 metres\".Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.At least 68,280 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Additional reporting by Erwan Rivault, Lamees Altalebi and Maha El Gaml",

    "body": "What's at stake as Trump boat strikes strain US-Colombia alliance21 hours agoJosé Carlos CuetoBBC News Mundo Colombia correspondentGetty ImagesClashes between presidents Trump and Petro have been frequent since the US leader returned to the White House in January For decades it was one of Washington's closest alliances. United in their fight against drug trafficking, Colombia and the United States co-operated closely, with the former receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in US military assistance annually. But now that alliance appears be more fragile than ever. The leaders of the two countries may have a similar style - forceful and not prone to mincing their words - but left-wing Gustavo Petro and Donald Trump come from opposing ends of the political spectrum and have clashed frequently since Trump returned to the White House in January.On Sunday, tensions reached their highest point when Trump accused Petro of encouraging drug production in Colombia and announced the suspension of payments and subsidies to the South American country.This came after Petro had in turn accused US officials of murdering a Colombian citizen and violating his country's sovereignty in one of the multiple strikes that the US military has carried out against alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean since early September.BBC Mundo spoke to experts who warned that with the alliance in jeopardy, both Colombia and the US could be at risk of losing out while organised crime groups look set to benefit. Read this article in SpanishColombia became one of the main beneficiaries of US aid in the early 2000s, with the money going towards \"Plan Colombia\" - a US-funded initiative to combat drug trafficking groups, reduce the flow of drugs to the US, and strengthen the Colombian security forces.This investment is credited with weakening the Farc guerrilla group, which was at war with the state before officially demobilising in 2016.Since then, US assistance has been reduced - and has come under questioning.Despite Colombia's military successes against armed groups, and its recent years of relative stability and security, some analysts doubt whether Plan Colombia truly resolved the drug problem in the long term.Cocaine production is currently at record-high levels in Colombia, according to  researcher Héctor Galeano from the Colombia-based Institute of Advanced Social and Cultural Studies of Latin America and the Caribbean.Piero Pomponi/NewsmakersThe first US aid package under Plan Colombia included $1.3bn  for the South American countryThe level of cultivation of coca, the key ingredient in cocaine, is also at record highs, although the Colombian government maintains that the rate of crop expansion has been slowing since 2021.The US military campaign in the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking paradoxically demonstrates that drugs have not been eradicated in the region and remain a priority for Washington.The strengthening of the security forces under Plan Colombia also had collateral effects.Paramilitary groups became involved in abuses against civilians, and some demobilised members of these groups later joined the drug-trafficking business.Similarly, the high number of military personnel in the early 2000s produced a large pool of young, retired soldiers, some of whom have been accused of signing up as mercenaries to fight in foreign conflicts.Getty ImagesPlan Colombia was agreed upon during the presidencies of Andrés Pastrana in Colombia and Bill Clinton in the United States.Despite the reduction in funding in previous years, US aid to Colombia still exceeded $400m (£300m) in 2024, according to estimates by the US-based research organisation Washington Office on Latin America (Wola).Elizabeth Dickinson, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told BBC Mundo that Colombia remained \"by far, the closest US partner in the fight against narcotics in all of Latin America\". \"It's been almost three decades of US investment, training, and an unprecedented level of coordination,\" Ms Dickinson said.The alliance has made Colombia and the US reliant on each other in terms of security. Today, thanks in part to US aid, Colombia has one of the most powerful militaries in Latin America.In turn, Washington relies heavily on Bogotá for its counter-narcotics operations, Ms Dickinson explains.  \"About 80% of the intelligence the US uses to intercept drugs in the Caribbean comes from Colombia.\"Eroding supportMilitary aid is not the only funding Colombia has received from the US in recent decades.With the help of USAID - Washington's foreign policy and development aid agency - Colombia launched several peace and growth projects, especially in poor and conflict-ridden areas.But earlier this year, the Trump administration announced the de facto dismantling of the agency. Colombia, USAID's largest beneficiary in the region, saw many of its initiatives cancelled and dozens of jobs lost.\"The other sources of aid come from the State Department in the form of civilian and defense funding,\" Ms Dickinson explains.She says that the assistance that exists today - which Trump appeared to refer to in his announcement of cuts - funds communications, intelligence, and equipment capabilities in Colombia, such as helicopters.\"But beyond these funding issues, the seizure, capture, and high-value operations that Colombia carries out are frequently co-ordinated with the United States,\" she continues. \"Not only is economic aid lost, but also the institutional relationship between the two countries combating a shared threat.\"In mid-September, the US for the first time in 30 years, officially named Colombia as a country which it said had \"demonstrably failed\" to uphold its obligations to control drug trafficking - thereby opening the door to a funding cut.However, at the time Washington stopped shot of cutting the aid flow, leaving the move as a warning.But just a month later, the feared cuts appear to be materialising.Inconvenient timingWatch: Colombia's President accuses Trump of “act of tyranny” in BBC interviewThe latest rift between Trump and Petro comes at perhaps the most inconvenient time possible for both administrations.Petro is fighting to bring \"total peace\" to Colombia, a campaign promise he made which this year appears to be collapsing with attacks by armed groups mounting in regions such as Catatumbo, Cauca, and Valle del Cauca, and culminating in the assassination of presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay in Bogotá.Trump, meanwhile, is waging a controversial campaign against drug traffickers, and since September, US military vessels have attacked suspected drug boats, killing at least 37 people - 32 in strikes carried out in the Caribbean and five more in the first  such US attacks on two vessels in the Pacific, carried out on Wednesday.This campaign has mainly been aimed at vessels alleged to have come from Venezuela, whose president, Nicolás Maduro, Trump accuses of being the leader of the Cartel of the Suns drug gang.Maduro has vehemently denied the accusation and said the strikes are aimed at ousting him from office.The legality of the operations has also been questioned by legal experts who warn that they breach international law. One of the most outspoken critics of the US strikes has been President Petro, who has called on the United Nations to open a \"criminal process\" against Trump for the strikes.Getty ImagesSince early September, the US has increased its military presence in the Caribbean with the aim of combating drug cartels in the areaNevertheless, both governments appear to need each other, although, in light of the recent tensions, they are also moving towards disengaging from each other.Mr Galeano says that given their opposing views and outspoken style it was clear that relations between Petro and Trump were \"going to explode at any moment, especially after the US bombings of the boats in the Caribbean\".In September, Petro told BBC News that Trump's attacks on boats were an \"act of tyranny\" and called for US officials to be prosecuted for \"murder\".Last Saturday, he echoed a report published by state-run media outlet RTVC alleging that a Colombian fisherman named Alejandro Carranza had been killed in a US strike on a boat on 16 September.Colombia's president says boat struck by US was carrying ColombiansHours later, Trump announced the suspension of aid and warned that if Petro did not stamp out drug production in Colombia, the US would do it for him \"and it won't be done nicely\".According to the Colombian Foreign Ministry, this constituted a threat \"to conduct an illegal intervention in Colombian territory\".'Devastating blow'Ms Dickinson describes the deterioration in US-Colombian relations and the cuts in aid as \"a devastating blow\" and warns that they are likely to \"weaken the ability of security forces to control armed groups\".She adds that it is \"difficult to understand\" why the US would take such a decision at a time when tensions are high in the region due to the US deployment in the Caribbean and Trump's declaration of an \"armed conflict\" with drug trafficking groups. \"Why confront your closest ally when regional security is already at stake?\" Ms Dickinson asks. Mr Galeano also thinks that cracks in the once strong US-Colombian alliance carry risks for both countries.\"Colombia needs the US, and the US needs Colombia. There are military bases that the US uses in Colombia, with agreements even signed during Petro's administration,\" he explains.\"In all of this, the criminal gangs win.\" \"While Trump focusses on the Caribbean, traffickers smuggle drugs through the Pacific, from Ecuador and Colombia, which are reportedly the source of most narcotics shipped out of South America,\" the expert adds.Since Trump returned to the US presidency in January, the friction between his and Petro's governments has barely let up.Within days, the two countries came close to a trade war after Petro turned back a flight carrying Colombian deportees from the US, denouncing the conditions in which they were traveling.The trade war was quickly averted after some frantic negotiations, but the crisis set the tone of things to come.Read: Co-operate or else: Trump's Colombia face-off is warning to all leadersWhen Colombian presidential candidate and opposition leader Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot dead in Bogotá in early June, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio linked his assassination to \"violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government\".Weeks later, both governments recalled their ambassadors for consultations, a move often interpreted in international relations as preceding the breaking off of bilateral relations.The envoys remained in place, but Washington has since dealt further severe blows to the Petro government.Not only did it formally decertify Colombia as a partner in the war on drugs, but it also revoked Petro's visa after he led a pro-Palestinian protest in New York during his visit there for the United Nations General Assembly.Following the suspension of US aid and amid the continuing tense antagonism between Petro and Trump many fear that relationship could deteriorate even further.

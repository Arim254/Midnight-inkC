    "body": "1 day agoJack BurgessEPAThe skeleton is being displayed in a nitrogen-filled plexiglass case in front of the altar at the lower church of Assisi's basilicaThe remains of Italy's patron saint, St Francis of Assisi, have gone on public display to mark 800 years since his death.Italian officials say about 400,000 people from around the world have reserved a place to see his bones in the central Italian town of Assisi.The 13th Century skeleton is being displayed from Sunday at the lower church of the famous Basilica of St Francis of Assisi.His remains have only been seen in public once before - for a single day in 1978 to a very limited group of people.EPASt Francis is one of the most venerated figures in Christianity and was born in the Italian city of Assisi in 1181 or 1182.He renounced his wealth and devoted his life to the poor, founding the order of the Franciscans. He is also the patron saint of animals and the environment.The Feast of St Francis is celebrated annually on 4 October to mark the day of his death in 1226.The late Pope Francis, who died last year after leading the Roman Catholic Church for more than a decade, chose his name and modelled his papacy after the radical humility of Saint Francis.St Francis of Assisi's bones will be on display until 22 March.

Irkutsk regional Governor Igor Kobzev offered his \"deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims\". He earlier said one Chinese tourist had managed to escape. The depth at the site of Friday's accident was 18m (59ft), and the divers had to use underwater cameras to search for the bodies.Baikal - the world's deepest lake with a maximum depth of 1,642m (5,387ft) - is a popular tourist destination. It often freezes during harsh winters and has seen a number of deadly accidents over the years.The bus fell into three-metre-wide ice fissure on Friday, Kobzev said in a post on Telegram.\"I would like to remind you once again that going out onto Lake Baikal's ice is not just prohibited right now. It's mortally dangerous,\" the governor said, urging tourists to use only official tour operators.He added that all the Chinese tourists - including a 14-year-old child - had travelled independently. A criminal investigation into the cause of the tragedy is now under way.Shortly afterwards Kobzev took to social media again, saying that \"sadly, even this tragedy hasn't taught people a lesson\", informing that six people trapped in their cars had been rescued in two separate incidents on Friday and Saturday.In late January, a Chinese tourist died after a car he was travelling overturned on the frozen surface of Lake Baikal.",

Deranque, a 23-year-old maths student, died in hospital on 14 February - two days after being beaten by a gang of masked young men in Lyon, in an attack which ministers from France's centre-right government have blamed on \"far-left\" militants.But the US embassy's comments appear to have angered the French government.\"We reject any use of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,\" Barrot said over the weekend. \"We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement,\" he added.BBC News has approached the US embassy to France for comment.AFPQuentin Deranque came under attack near an event by a leading radical left politician in LyonSix men suspected of being involved in the fatal assault have been charged over Deranque's death, while a parliamentary assistant for a deputy from the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) party has also been charged with complicity.LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is a likely contender in next year's presidential election, has said his party had \"nothing to do with this story\" and condemned \"all forms of violence\".\"We express our consternation, but also our empathy and compassion for [Deranque's] family and friends,\" he said.",

The bus had been travelling from Pokhara, a popular tourist spot.Nepal's Home Ministry has created a five-member taskforce to investigate the cause of the incident. The UK Foreign Office said it was assisting the family of the Briton who was killed.Nepalese authorities identified him as Stewart Dominic Ethan. His name has not been confirmed by the Foreign Office.Nepalese police say they have identified all 19 bodies, including a 40-year-old Chinese woman and a 32-year-old man from India. Among the injured is a Chinese national and a New Zealander.All the injured had been taken to hospitals in the capital, they added. Children were among those onboard.Multiple teams were sent to the site, including police units, the army and a rescue team of divers, authorities said.Police spokesman Abinarayan Kafle said 17 people died at the scene, with two more dying while receiving treatment, BBC Nepali reported.Road accidents are relatively commonplace in Nepal, due to a range of factors including poor road maintenance and narrow paths in mountainous areas.In 2024, at least 14 people died after a bus travelling from Pokhara to Kathmandu fell into the Marsyangdi river in the Tanahun district.\"We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Nepal and are in contact with the local authorities,\" a Foreign Office spokesman told the BBC.Nepal is a popular destination for many international visitors, especially climbers, who travel there to access a key section of the Himalaya mountain range that includes Mount Everest.",

    "body": "1 day agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe US operates two dedicated hospital boats, including the USNS Mercy Greenland's prime minister has asked US President Donald Trump to talk to him instead of making \"random outbursts on social media\", after Trump said he was sending a US hospital boat to \"take care\" of people on the island.Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was going to send a boat filled with medical supplies, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\".Jens-Frederik Nielsen responded \"it's going to be a no thanks from us,\" and said that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US. Trump has long coveted the vast arctic island - but conceded in January that he would not take it by force, after previously refusing to rule out doing so. He later announced a \"framework for a future deal\" around the US and Greenland, after Denmark and Nato allies made it clear that they would not give in to his calls to relinquish sovereignty.In his post on social media, Trump said that he and his Greenland envoy Jeff Landry were \"going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It's on the way!!!\"The post included what appeared to be an illustrated or AI image of the USNS Mercy, one of two hospital ships operated by the US navy. It is not clear if Trump was referencing either of those ships, or what had prompted his decision. Responding to the post, Nielsen said that Trump's idea \"is noted. But we have a public healthcare system where treatment is free for citizens.\"\"It's not like that in the United States, where it costs money to go to the doctor,\" he wrote on Facebook.Nielsen added that Greenland remained open to cooperating with the US but underlined the importance of discussing issues directly.\"Talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media,\" he said.Trump's post came soon after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine close to Nuuk. It is not clear if Trump's post was related to the incident.A month on from Trump announcing a \"framework for a future deal\" over Greenland, details are still unclear, though earlier this month US vice president JD Vance alleged that European countries were \"willing to make a lot of accommodations\".",

Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

    "body": "2 days agoOttilie MitchellReutersVenezuelan Interim President Delcy Rodríguez and her brother National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez at Miraflores Palace in CaracasA total of 1,557 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty under a new law introduced on Thursday, the country's National Assembly President has said. Jorge Rodríguez, brother of Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodríguez and an ally of former President Nicolás Maduro, also said \"hundreds\" of prisoners had  already been released. Among them is politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of several opposition voices to have criticised the law for excluding certain prisoners.The US has urged Venezuela to speed up its release of political prisoners since US forces seized Maduro in a raid on 3 January. Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners.At a news conference on Saturday Jorge Rodríguez said 1,557 release requests were being addressed \"immediately\" and ultimately the legislation would extend to 11,000 prisoners.The government first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics for years. These groups have also criticised the new law. One frequently cited criticism is that it would not extend amnesty to those who called for foreign armed intervention in Venezuela, BBC Latin America specialist Luis Fajardo says.He noted that law professor Juan Carlos Apitz, of the Central University of Venezuela, told CNN Español that that part of the amnesty law \"has a name and surname\". \"That paragraph is the Maria Corina Machado paragraph.\" It is not clear if the amnesty would actually cover Machado, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, Fajardo said.He added that other controversial aspects of the law include the apparent exclusion from amnesty benefits of dozens of military officers involved in rebellions against the Maduro administration over the years.On Saturday, Rodríguez said it is \"releases from Zona Seven of El Helicoide that they're handling first\". Those jailed at the infamous prison in Caracas would be released \"over the next few hours\", he added.Activists say some family members of those imprisoned in the facility have gone on hunger strike to demand the release of their relatives.Maduro is awaiting trial in custody in the US alongside his wife Cilia Flores and has pleaded not guilty to drugs and weapons charges, saying that he is a \"prisoner of war\".",

He was then taken into custody alongside his bodyguard - neither man has commented on the charges.Appearing in court, dressed in black, Mugabe looked calm during the proceedings.Bellarmine is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.Searching the property in Hyde Park where the shooting happened, police have found bullet cartridges but no firearm so far.Mugabe and Tobias Tamirepi Matonhodze, 33, also face additional charges, including defeating the ends of justice, which relates to the missing firearm, prosecutors say.The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition.Speaking outside court, Mugabe's lawyer Sinenhlanhla Mnguni provided an update on his well-being, telling reporters his client was \"fine\" as he remains in custody. Describing the circumstances of the shooting, prosecutors allege that \"an altercation occurred between the victim and the accused inside Mugabe's home\".While attempting to flee the victim was then allegedly \"shot in the back and collapsed outside the gate\" and the gate was then closed, according to a statement from the National Prosecuting Authority.The case against Mugabe and Matonhodze was postponed until 3 March when a bail application will be made.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "2 days agoOttilie MitchellandYama Bariz,BBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIslamabad said the strikes were launched on Afghanistan following recent suicide bombings in PakistanPakistan has carried out multiple overnight air strikes on Afghanistan, which the Taliban has said killed at least 18 people, including women and children.Islamabad said the attacks targeted seven alleged militant camps and hideouts near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and that they had been launched after recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.Afghanistan condemned the attacks, saying they targeted multiple civilian homes and a religious school. The fresh strikes come after the two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in October following deadly cross-border clashes, though subsequent fighting has taken place.The Taliban's defence ministry said the strikes targeted civilian areas of Nangarhar and Paktika provinces and had killed dozens of people.In Girdi Kas village, in the Bihsud district of Nangarhar, a man named Shahabuddin told reporters while pointing at his destroyed house that of 23 members of his family, only five had survived the attack. Local Taliban spokesman Sayed Taib Hamd said that 18 members of the family had been killed.The BBC had earlier been told about 20 people were thought to have died. No deaths have been reported so far in the other areas hit. A guesthouse and a religious school were targeted in the Bermal and Urgun districts of Paktika province, but they were empty at the time of the attacks, local officials and locals told the BBC.AFP via Getty ImagesHouses were also destroyed in Balish village in the Urgun district of Paktika province (pictured)Pakistan's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said it had carried out \"intelligence based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts\".In a statement on X, it said the targets included members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, which the government refers to as \"Fitna al Khawarij,\" along with their affiliates and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province.The ministry described the strikes as \"a retributive response\" to recent suicide bombings in Pakistan by terror groups it said were sheltered by Kabul.The recent attacks in Pakistan included one on a Shia mosque in the capital Islamabad earlier this month, as well as others that took place since the holy month of Ramadan began this week in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Pakistan accused the Afghan Taliban of failing to take action against the militants, adding that it had \"conclusive evidence\" that the attacks were carried out by militants on the instructions of their leadership in Afghanistan.The Taliban's defence ministry later posted on X condemning the attacks as a \"blatant violation of Afghanistan's territorial integrity\", adding that they were a \"clear breach of international law\".It warned that \"an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time\", adding that \"attacks on civilian targets and religious institutions indicate the failure of Pakistan's army in intelligence and security.\"The strikes come days after Saudi Arabia mediated the release of three Pakistani soldiers earlier this week, who were captured in Kabul during border clashes last October.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border.",

    "body": "Kim Jong Un re-appointed leader of North Korea's ruling party18 hours agoKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesKim Jong Un vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living in his opening speech to the congressNorth Korea's ruling Workers' Party has again chosen Kim Jong Un to be its general secretary, state media report.The announcement, which was made at a rubber-stamp party congress in Pyongyang on Sunday, comes as little surprise given the Kim family has ruled by dictatorship since the late 1940s.State-run KCNA said that under Kim's leadership North Korea \"radically improved\" its \"war deterrence\", \"with the nuclear forces as its pivot\".Despite long-standing international sanctions, North Korea has continued to build its nuclear capabilities, regularly testing banned intercontinental missiles. But the secrecy of the regime makes it harder to evaluate how much progress the military has made.  Kim, who took control of the regime after his father's death in 2011, has invested heavily in the nuclear weapons programme, turning Pyongyang into a far bigger challenge for the West, and especially the US.  He is expected to announce the next phase of the country's weapons programme during the Ninth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, which began on 19 February and is now in its fourth day. Before it started, North Korea unveiled what it said was a range of nuclear-capable rocket launchers.The congress has been held once every five years in the last decade.With some 5,000 party members in attendance, according to KCNA, it offers a rare glimpse into the structure of political power in North Korea, which remains quite opaque to even the keenest watchers.The meetings are considered to be the most important political event and provide insight into where the country's priorities lie, from foreign policy to its nuclear ambitions.While Kim has remained at the top of North Korean leadership, the party congress' presidium, or executive committee, has been reshuffled since the last meeting in 2021. More than half of its 39 members have been replaced, according to state media.In his opening speech last week, Kim vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living, which he described as \"heavy and urgent historic tasks\".All eyes are on whether Kim's daughter, Ju Ae, will make an appearance at the congress.Earlier this month, South Korea's spy agency said that Kim had chosen Ju Ae as his heir. Believed to be 13 years old, she has become an increasingly prominent figure at official events, inspecting missiles and attending Beijing's military parade with her father.Chinese president Xi Jinping called Kim to congratulate him on his re-appointment on Monday, saying he would work with Kim to \"write a new chapter in the China-North Korea friendship\", Chinese state media reported.Beijing has long been Pyongyang's most significant ally: it is North Korea's largest trade partner and source of aid. But at the same time, China is wary of Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, which could destabilise the region, and its growing ties with Vladimir Putin's Russia.",

    "body": "Final missing Lake Tahoe skier found dead 5 days after avalanche 2 days agoChristal Hayes and Nardine SaadLos AngelesReutersThe ninth and final missing skier has been found dead in California's Lake Tahoe backcountry, five days after a powerful avalanche struck several guides and a tight-knit group of friends on a trip. Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said on Saturday during a news conference that all nine bodies have now been recovered from the Castle Peak area in the Sierra Nevada mountains. She also released the names of all nine victims, which included close friends, a pair of sisters and three guides. Two people who were part of the group escaped the \"football-field sized\" avalanche - the deadliest in modern California history - and authorities said they might help piece together what happened.Sheriff Moon and others during the news conference described the harsh weather rescue crews were met with after the avalanche, and that white-out conditions stalled days of searching.Authorities said there was an ongoing avalanche risk after the Tuesday disaster and high winds prevented them from being able to utilize helicopters for days.When winds calmed on Friday, helicopters were used to pour water over the area - a tactic meant to mitigate an avalanche risk - authorities said. Crews were then sent to search for the ninth missing skier.The victims were confirmed on Saturday as: Carrie Atkin, 46, of Soda Springs, California; Lizabeth Clabaugh, 52, of Boise, Idaho; Danielle Keatley, 44, of Soda Springs and Larkspur, California; Kate Morse, 45, of Soda Springs and Tiburon, California; Caroline Sekar, 45, of Soda Springs and San Francisco, California; and Katherine Vitt, 43, of Greenbrae, California.The three Blackbird Mountain guides who died were identified as Andrew Alissandratos, 34, of Verdi, Nevada; Nicole Choo, 42, of South Lake Tahoe, California, and Michael Henry, 30, from Soda Springs.Earlier this week, a family spokesperson identified several of the skiers to the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\"While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,\" Moon said at the news conference.She said they relied on avalanche experts, who said the disaster spread across the size of an American football field and was nearly powerful enough to take out a house.Six members of the 15-person backcountry ski group were rescued early this week. The group was on its way back from a three-day guided ski trip in the backcountry when the avalanche struck, bringing with it eight feet (2.4 meters) of snow and 90 mph winds.Nevada County Undersheriff Sam Brown on Thursday told CBS that when the avalanche hit, the skiers went into what he called \"frantic mode\" to try to find their friends and partners.\"They were ultimately able to unbury three individuals who did not survive,\" Brown said.The Nevada County Sheriff's Office said on Friday that authorities are investigating whether there could be criminal negligence relating to the avalanche, CBS reported.",

    "body": "8 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is eighth in line to the throneAustralia's prime minister has told Sir Keir Starmer his government would back plans to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.Anthony Albanese expressed his support for such a proposal in a letter to the UK prime minister.Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including \"prince\", in October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The UK government is considering introducing legislation to remove him from the line of succession. It follows Andrew's arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office on Thursday. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.The former prince was released under investigation 11 hours after his arrest by Thames Valley Police.Removing Andrew from the line of succession would require an act of Parliament supported by the 14 Commonwealth countries where King Charles III, his brother, is head of state, including Australia.Albanese's letter reads: \"Dear Prime Minister Starmer, in light of recent events concerning Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, I am writing to confirm that my government would agree to any proposal to remove him from the line of royal succession.\"I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation.\"These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.\"Speaking after his brother Andrew's arrest, King Charles had said: \"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.\"A spokesman for the UK prime minister confirmed the letter had been received and said the government was \"considering whether further steps are required in relation to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\". \"Given the ongoing police investigation it would not be appropriate for the government to comment further at this stage,\" the spokesman added.Darren Jones, chief secretary to the prime minister, told MPs on Monday that the government was \"not ruling out action in respect of the line of succession at this stage\". Removing Andrew from the line of succession would require an act of Parliament approved by MPs and peers, and would come into effect when given royal assent by the King.Canada, Jamaica and New Zealand are among the Commonwealth countries who would also need to support it.The last time someone was removed from the line of succession by an act of Parliament was in 1936, when the former Edward VIII and his descendants were removed due to his abdication.Getty ImagesAnthony Albenese wrote to his UK counterpart on MondayBuckingham Palace has not publicly commented on the government's consideration of legislation to remove Andrew from the line of succession.On Friday, Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC that the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the \"right thing to do,\" regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray meanwhile said \"any questions in that sphere would be quite complicated\", adding that the live police investigation needed to \"play out\".Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said on Monday that Parliament should not pass legislation to remove the former prince from the line of succession \"until the police have finished their jobs\". He also cautioned against a \"trial by media\".The former prince was arrested at 08:00 GMT on Thursday at Sandringham, the King's Norfolk estate where Andrew has been living since leaving his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, in early February.Police searches at Sandringham concluded late on Thursday. It is understood they continued at the 30-room property in Windsor over the weekend, where several unmarked police cars were seen on Saturday.Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on specific allegations that have emerged after the US release of millions of files in January connected to the late financier's case.",

    "body": "2 days agoMaia DaviesReutersMike Huckabee, pictured in September, has long been a supporter of IsraelArab and Muslim governments have condemned remarks made by the US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel would be justified in taking over a vast stretch of the Middle East on Biblical grounds.In an interview with conservative US commentator Tucker Carlson, Huckabee was asked whether Israel had a right to an area which the host said was, according to the Bible, \"essentially the entire Middle East\".The ambassador said \"it would be fine if it took it all\". But he added Israel was not seeking to do so, rather it is \"asking to at least take the land that they now occupy\" and protect its people.In a joint statement, more than a dozen governments including Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates called the comments \"dangerous and inflammatory\", and a threat to efforts to end the war in Gaza.In the interview, released on Friday, Carlson pressed the ambassador on his interpretation of a Bible verse which the host claimed suggested Israel had a right to the land between the River Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.Huckabee said \"it would be a big piece of land\" but stressed that \"I don't think that's what we're talking about here today\".He later added: \"They're not asking to go back to take all of that, but they are asking to at least take the land that they now occupy, they now live in, they now own legitimately, and it is a safe haven for them.\"He also said his earlier remark that Israel could take it \"all\" had been somewhat \"hyperbolic\".Following the interview's release, the UAE's foreign ministry released the statement  on behalf of various governments and other actors expressing \"strong condemnation and profound concern\" regarding the comments.The statement said Huckabee had \"indicated that it would be acceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the occupied West Bank\".It said the remarks violated international law and directly contradicted US President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, including efforts to create \"a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state\".The statement continued: \"The ministries reaffirmed that Israel has no sovereignty whatsoever over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands.\"\"They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states.\"The statement said it was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.Huckabee has frequently expressed his support for Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank, contradicting decades of US policy.Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in 2024.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that the court had made a \"decision of lies\" and insisted that \"the Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land\".Successive Israeli governments have allowed settlements to grow. However, expansion has risen sharply since Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the head of a right-wing, pro-settler coalition, as well as the start of the Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's deadly 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's subsequent military offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

    "body": "9 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulandAnna Holligan,in The HagueGetty ImagesRob Jetten at his swearing-in ceremony with King Willem-AlexanderRob Jetten has become the youngest and first openly gay prime minister of the Netherlands after his minority government was sworn in.The 38-year-old claimed victory in October's election with his Democrats 66 party (D66) narrowly beating anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders in a nail-biting election.Jetten formed a centre-right minority government with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the Christian Democratic Alliance (CDA).It is a minority cabinet, meaning every major reform in the coalition deal - from an extra €19bn (£16.6bn) for defence to painful cuts in healthcare and benefits - will have to be negotiated vote by vote in the Netherlands' two parliamentary houses.The coalition also wants fewer asylum seekers, with refugees having to apply for asylum outside Europe, not after they arrive.Asylum migration has been a particularly sensitive issue in Dutch politics, contributing to the downfall of the country's last two coalition governments. D66 will provide seven ministers, VVD will provide six, and CDA five, with three state secretaries each - junior members of cabinet.Jetten was formally sworn in by King Willem-Alexander at the Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague on Monday.Posting a selfie ahead of his swearing-in ceremony, Jetten wrote on X: \"Proud to be doing this together. In a new phase, with great responsibility and, above all, a shared promise to work for everyone in the Netherlands.\"By not dwelling on what's wrong, but by building on what can be improved. That requires courage and collaboration.\"EPAPrime Minister Dick Schoof during a handover ceremony with Rob Jetten 'Let's get to work' Slick, smiling and patient, Jetten has spent years shaking off the nickname \"Robot Jetten\", earned for his stiff, over‑rehearsed TV appearances.The transformation was stark on election night. In a packed, sweaty music venue in Leiden (between Amsterdam and The Hague), he seemed effortlessly at ease, confident and groomed, as young supporters roared around him.For many BBC News met there that night, the D66 leader was everything Wilders was not: relatively young, upbeat, pro‑EU and socially liberal - a fresh face pitched against an older, hard‑right establishment.In the Netherlands, Jetten's sexuality barely featured in the campaign, which says something about how mainstream LGBTQ equality has become.But globally, he joins a very small club of openly gay leaders, and for many viewers in countries where coming out carries real risk, seeing an openly gay man become prime minister is a powerful glass‑ceiling moment.Standing beside the King on a red carpet spilling down the palace steps on Monday, Jetten gave the appearance of a well-polished premier.After being confirmed as prime minister, he posted the official photo on Instagram with a brisk caption: \"Let's get to work.\"Wilders, who pulled the plug on his own right-wing coalition in June, has said he would oppose any initiative by Jetten's government, while other parties have raised concerns about the plans presented so far.Jesse Klaver, leader of the GreenLeft-Labour coalition, the biggest alliance in opposition, posted on X on Friday about the government's financial plans: \"Ordinary people will pay hundreds of Euros more, while the very richest won't be asked to pay anything extra.\"That's unfair and won't help the Netherlands move forward. We take responsibility for adjusting these plans. This has to change.\"",

Parts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts have seen nearly 33in (83cm) of snow fall, with more than19in in New York's Central Park, the National Weather Service said. There have been \"near impossible\" travel conditions in New York, a state agency warned. More than 600,000 homes and businesses on the east coast endured power outages, with New Jersey and Massachusetts the worst hit.Winter storm warnings stretched from North Carolina to northern Maine, with some warnings in place further north in parts of eastern Canada.The snow was expected to persist throughout Monday, according to the National Weather Service, with some areas near the northeast coastline expected to get a total of 1ft to 2ft (61cm) of snow by Tuesday morning.Rhode Island, America's smallest state, appeared to have received the most snow during the storm. In fact, it was the worst snowstorm to ever hit the state, according to local media.Providence, the state capital, received 33in of snow, smashing the existing record for the single greatest snowstorm, 28.6in set in February 1978.\"It completely smashed it,\" Candice Hrencecin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston, told the New York Times. \"We were just as shocked as everyone else.\"A ban on non-essential travel was implemented in Rhode Island and also in neighbouring Connecticut. Later in the day, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey also imposed a travel ban.\"I'm issuing a travel ban on all non-essential driving in Southeastern Massachusetts — and reducing the speed limit on the Pike to 40mph (25kmh),\" she said in an online post, referring to a major highway in the state.\"Whiteout conditions are making travel extremely dangerous,\" she added. \"If you get stuck, help will have a hard time reaching you... I strongly urge everyone to stay off the roads no matter where you live.\"In Massachusetts, nearly 300,000 were without power, according to poweroutage.us, including 85% of customers in Barnstable County, which includes all of Cape Cod.Watch: Winter storm covers parts north-east US in snowIn New York, a travel ban brought the city of over 8 million to a near standstill before it was lifted at noon local time.In Connecticut and New Jersey, there were concerns that falling trees and branches could lead to dangerous road conditions and more power outages.In Providence, a city spokesman told The Providence Journal that more than 300 vehicles had been towed for parking in the way of plows.

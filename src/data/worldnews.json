    "body": "2 hours agoLaura Gozzi and Paul KirbyReutersThe suspect was detained by police after he set fire to his carA driver has rammed his car into pedestrians and cyclists on the holiday island of Oléron, off the west coast of France, injuring five people - including two who are in a critical condition.A local man in his mid-30s deliberately drove into people and was arrested after being immobilised with a stun gun, authorities said. The man drove some distance between two villages on the island, mowing down several people including a young girl, the mayor of Dolus d'Oléron Thibault Brechkoff said.He eventually abandoned his vehicle and set fire to it before running away, Brechkoff said. The public prosecutor for La Rochelle, Arnaud Laraize, said the suspect was known to police and that he shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\") at the moment of his arrest. Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, who travelled to the scene, said an inquiry had been opened into the incident and that the prosecutor would decide whether to pass on the case to anti-terrorism authorities.He said that one of the badly injured victims was a 22-year-old woman who suffered multiple traumas.The 35-year-old suspect is being held by police in Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron on suspicion of attempted murder.A popular holiday destination, the Ile d'Oléron is metropolitan France's second largest island after Corsica and connected to the mainland by a road bridge.The incident took place around 08:45 (07:45 GMT) and lasted 25 minutes, Nuñez said. According to local reports said a gas canister was found in the back of the suspect's car after he set the vehicle alight. Witnesses described seeing a series of incidents in several places on the island, including the villages of Dolus d'Oléron and Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron, which came to an end outside a bakery.",

    "body": "22 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterThe head of Britain's richest family, Gopichand Hinduja, has died aged 85.Known as GP, Mr Hinduja and his family made their fortune from the Indian conglomerate Hinduja Group, which operates in 11 sectors including finance, media and entertainment, and oil.It has about 200,000 staff around the world.The family said in a statement: \"He will leave a deep hole at the heart of our family.\"They added that he would be \"remembered for his formidable work\".Mr Hinduja helped transform his father's modest textile and trading businesses into a global conglomerate and one of India's largest companies.Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer, said he would be remembered as someone who \"personified\" the links between India and the UK.\"Whether it was in banking, whether it was in manufacturing, whether it was in property, they were always putting the UK and India together\"GP was not only a famous and respected individual in the UK and India but a great champion for our two countries. We shall miss him greatly.\"Mr Hinduja and his family topped the most recent Sunday Times Rich List with a net worth of £35.3bn. They also ranked 11th on the Forbes list of India's 100 richest businesspeople in 2024.Mr Hinduja was the second eldest of four brothers who controlled the business for decades.The oldest of the four, Srichand, died in 2023 at 87.It is not known who will now take over the leadership of the conglomerate. The youngest brother, Ashok, runs its operations across India including truck maker Ashok Leyland.The Hinduja conglomerate operates in 48 countries.The family also own significant real estate in London, including a number of large homes near to St James's Park and Winston Churchill's Old War Office in Whitehall, which has recently been refurbished to include a hotel.Mr Hinduja largely kept out of the public eye but was involved in the controversial \"Hinduja affair\" in 2001.Mr Hinduja had written to then-government minister Peter Mandelson about his brother Prakash obtaining British citizenship, after the family's charity had donated £1m to the Millennium Dome, for which Mandelson was responsible.Mandelson resigned as a minister as a result, but was later cleared of wrongdoing after an inquiry. Prakash, his wife, their son and his wife were jailed by a Swiss court last year for exploiting domestic staff in their Geneva mansion.",

    "body": "1 day agoGetty ImagesA search and rescue operation continues for the rest of the group, which includes other foreign nationals and local guidesDiwakar Pyakurel & Phanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali in Kathmandu and Kathryn ArmstrongAt least seven climbers, including five foreigners and two Nepalis, have died after being hit by an avalanche on a Himalayan peak in north-eastern Nepal, expedition agency Seven Summit Treks said.The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. Rescuers located two bodies, and are still searching for the remaining five, who are believed to have been buried by snow. Eight others have been rescued and are in the capital Kathmandu getting treatment for their injuries.All these climbers were part of a group that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told BBC Nepali. The bodies of the other five deceased climbers \"may be 10-15 feet below the snow\", said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks. \"It will take time to find them.\"Those killed include two Italians, a Canadian, a German, a French national, and two Nepalis who served as guides. Local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC on Monday that a rescue helicopter had landed in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp.One of the injured climbers told The Kathmandu Post that they had repeatedly called for help, to no avail. \"Had the rescue arrived on time, more lives could have been saved,\" he told the newspaper.Mr Mahato told reporters that rescue efforts were hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, which made it hard to fly helicopters or reach the site on foot.The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft). They had planned to climb the 5,630m Yalung Ri as part of their acclimatisation schedule.Separately, the bodies of two Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale another mountain in Nepal have been recovered, officials have confirmed.Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week on the Panbari mountain in western Nepal. The third member of the group, named in media reports as Velter Perlino, 65, was able to be rescued, along with one sherpa.The group had been granted permission to climb the 6,887m peak, but were reported missing when they lost contact with the base camp following heavy snowfall on 28 October.\"When a helicopter was sent yesterday [Monday] to the Panbari peak for rescue operations, it could not find them, but rescued one Italian team leader and a sherpa from the base camp,\" Himal Gautam, department of tourism director, said. Their bodies were recovered on Tuesday and have been flown to Kathmandu.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains. Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas. Two British and one Irish woman were among a group that had to be rescued after being trapped for several days in the western Mustang region. Severe weather also left hundreds of hikers stranded near Mount Everest in October. ",

    "body": "Suspected drone sightings have disrupted flights at airports across Belgium on Tuesday, with no flights departing or arriving at Brussels Airport - the country's busiest. Air traffic was suspended around 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) after a drone sighting. An hour later it briefly reopened, before closing again shortly after.Liege Airport was also affected and it was not clear when flights would resume. Local media also reported drone sightings at the Kleine-Brogel and Florennes military airbases, local media reported.It is the latest in a string of suspected drone sightings causing disruption at European airports - including in Munich, Copenhagen and Oslo.A statement on the Brussels Airport website on Tuesday evening read: \"There are currently no departing or arriving flights at Brussels Airport due to drone sightings around the airport.\"A later statement said: \"This disruption has led to delays and some flight cancellations and might still impact flight operations on Wednesday morning.\"Pictures taken inside the airport showed what appeared to be camp beds being readied for passengers.Officials at Brussels' second-largest airport, Charleroi, said air traffic was briefly halted there as a precaution too.Local media reported flights had initially been diverted to Liege - before that also closed due to suspected drone sightings.It added that flights had since been diverted to nearby airports - including Ostend and Charleroi in Belgium, and Eindhoven and Maastricht in the Netherlands.Tuesday was the fourth night in a row that the Belgian authorities reported drone sightings over Kleine-Brogel, a major military base near the Dutch border. Belgium's defence minister, Theo Francken, said on Monday that an investigation was under way, calling it \"a clear mission targeting Kleine Broge\".Drones were also seen close to Ostend and Antwerp's Deurne airports over the weekend, according to Belgian news site VRT.

    "body": "A fire that broke out in a nursing home in northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina has left 11 people dead and at least 30 others injured, authorities say.The blaze started on Tuesday night at the retirement facility in the town of Tuzla, breaking out on the seventh floor shortly after 20:45 local time (19:45 GMT).Around 20 people were sent to a medical centre for treatment, including firefighters, police officers, medical workers, employees, and residents of the home, a police spokesperson said.While cause of the fire was not immediately clear, Prime Minister Nermin Nikšić called it \"a disaster of enormous proportions\".Officials said a full investigation would be conducted as soon as conditions were safe.A resident of the nursing home, Ruza Kajic, said she lived on the third floor of the building and was woken up after hearing a \"cracking sound\".\"I looked out the window and saw burning material falling from above. I ran out into the hallway. On the upper floors, there are bed-ridden people,\" she told public broadcaster BHRT.Footage from the scene showed flames erupting from the windows of an upper floor of the nursing home.The head of the nursing home, Mirsad Bakalović, said he knew everyone who had been caught up in the fire and after everything he had seen during the fire he had decided to resign.The chairman of Bosnia-Herzegovina's tripartite presidency, Željko Komšić, offered condolences to the victims' families and the injured.According to a spokesperson for the Tuzla University clinical centre, several patients were being treated for carbon monoxide poisoning, three of whom were in intensive care, local media reported.",

    "body": "Investigators have boarded an Australian cruise ship more than 10 days after the death of an elderly female passenger who was left behind on a remote island.Suzanne Rees, 80, had been hiking on Lizard Island with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her, only returning several hours later when the crew realised Ms Rees was missing.Officials from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) boarded the vessel on Wednesday morning local time.Amsa, which is probing the incident alongside Queensland Police and the state coroner, told the BBC it could not comment on the investigation.The 60-day cruise around Australia, which had cost guests tens of thousands of dollars, was cancelled due to Ms Rees' death as well as mechanical issues.The Coral Adventurer had been expected to dock at Cairns – where its operator Coral Expeditions is based.But a lack of available berths meant it instead dropped anchor a few kilometres north early on Tuesday evening, off the coast of Yorkey's Knob, where it remained on Wednesday morning.The BBC understands only a skeleton crew were on board.Ship tracking data showed one of the vessel's smaller boats, known as a tender, moving between the ship and the shore on Tuesday night.All passengers disembarked at Horn Island in the far north of Queensland over the weekend and were transferred to the mainland on a charter plane.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast.Tracking data shows the vessel initially left Cairns at around 07:30 local time on 24 October - after a delay of around a week because of mechanical issues.The next day it reached Lizard Island - also known as Jiigurru or Dyiigurra - in the northern area of the Great Barrier Reef for the first stop on the journey.Passengers aboard were transported by tenders to the secluded island – home to a luxury resort and a research station - for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne Rees' daughter, Katherine Rees, said last week that her family was \"shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\".She described her mother, who was from Sydney,  as an \"active 80-year-old\" who was a member of a bushwalking group.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\"Ms Rees added that she hoped the coroner's inquiry would be able to pinpoint what \"the company should have done that might have saved mum's life\".\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" she said.\"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"A search and rescue effort late on Saturday 25 October – the day she went missing – did not find any sign of Ms Rees. Her body was discovered the following day.Last week Mark Fifield, the chief executive of the cruise operator Coral Expeditions, confirmed the firm was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Mr Fifield said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.",

    "body": "1 day agoLucy Fleming and Richard KagoeAt least 40 people in Sudan have been killed in a drone strike that targeted a funeral that was taking place outside the army-held city of el-Obeid in North Kordofan state, officials and activists say.They blamed the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for Monday's attack on al-Luweib village as mourners had gathered in a tent. The RSF has not yet commented.Many reportedly died before getting to hospital in el-Obeid, a strategic city that connects the capital, Khartoum, to the western region of Darfur.Fighting has intensified in this oil-rich Kordofan area and around 20,000 people fled to el-Obeid last week after the RSF captured Bara town, 30km (18 miles) north of the city.The town fell at the same time as the city of el-Fasher, which had been the army's last stronghold in Darfur.There have since been reports of mass killings, sexual violence, abductions and widespread looting in el-Fasher by RSF fighters.The UN said summary executions of civilians by RSF fighters had also also been reported in Bara.Such atrocities could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has warned.The RSF leader has promised to investigate \"violations\" but his paramilitary group has denied widespread allegations that the killings in el-Fasher are ethnically motivated and follow a pattern of the Arab paramilitaries targeting non-Arab populations.The ICC's statement came as a global group of food security experts confirmed on Monday that el-Fasher residents were suffering from famine following the RSF's 18-month siege of the city.The UN-accredited Integrated Food Security Phase network (IPC) also said the city of Kadugli in South Kordofan state was in the most catastrophic stage of hunger.The city, nearly 300km south of el-Obeid, has been also surrounded and starved of supplies by the RSF.UN chief António Guterres has called for an immediate halt to the violence in Sudan, warning that the humanitarian crisis is rapidly worsening.\"The horrifying crisis in Sudan... is spiralling out of control,\" he said on the side-lines of a summit in Doha.\"El-Fasher and the surrounding areas... have been an epicentre of suffering, hunger, violence and displacement - and since the Rapid Support Forces entered el-Fasher last weekend, the situation is growing worse by the day,\" AFP news agency quotes him as saying.Guterres urged the army and the RSF to come to the negotiating table and \"bring an end to this nightmare of violence\".A Sudanese government source has told AFP that the authorities are considering a US proposal for a truce.Washington - along with other states - has been pushing for a ceasefire and a roadmap to end the conflict.There have been several rounds of peace talks in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - but they have failed - and both sides have shown an unwillingness to agree to a ceasefire.The North Kordofan Resistance Committee, a volunteer aid group, said the attack on the village, which is 15km east of el-Obeidz, happened on Monday.Mohamed Ismail, North Kordofan's humanitarian aid commissioner, told the Sudan Tribune new website: \"Drones belonging to the Rapid Support Forces militia attacked citizens who were at a funeral, resulting in the death of 40 people and the injury of dozens.\"Last week, the UN said el-Obeid was already struggling to cope with the influx of those fleeing from Bara.Since the civil war erupted between the army and RSF in April 2023, more than 150,000 people have died about 12 million have fled their homes in what the UN has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis.",

    "body": "16 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesReddit is one of the latest platforms to be added to Australia's social media banPopular forum site Reddit has been added to Australia's world-first social media ban for children under 16 that starts next month.Live-streaming platform Kick will also be included, bringing the number of sites targeted in the ban to nine. They include Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Threads.From 10 December, tech companies can be fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to deactivate existing accounts for under-16s and prohibit new ones.Each banned platform was chosen as their \"sole or a significant purpose is to enable online social interaction,\" the government said, and more sites may be added given the \"fast-changing\" nature of technology.\"Delaying children's access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,\" said Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant.Messaging services Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms Lego Play and Roblox will not be included, nor will Google Classroom and YouTube Kids.Federal Communications Minister Anika Wells said the online platforms can target children with \"chilling control\" and the ban was about protecting children.\"We aren't chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference,\" she said.It is unclear how companies will implement the ban - which is being closely watched by global leaders - but some of the potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology. Critics have raised concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software, with a recent report showing the proposed methods all have risks or shortcomings. Most Australian adults support the ban, according to polls, but some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.Instead, they say, the government should focus on better policing of harmful content on social media platforms and prepare children for the reality of life on the web.An Australian influencer family who have millions of YouTube follower recently announced their decision to move to the UK to avoid the upcoming ban, namely so their 14-year-old daughter can continue to create online content.YouTube was initially exempt from the ban but in July, the government reversed its decision, saying the video sharing site was \"the most frequently cited platform\" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw \"harmful content\".Teens under 16 will still be able to view YouTube videos but will not be permitted to have an account, which is required for uploading content or interacting on the platform.",

    "body": "Iran has released two French nationals who were detained there for more than three years, French President Emmanuel Macron has said.Cécile Kohler, 41 and her partner Jacques Paris, 72, have been released from Evin prison, Macron said on Tuesday, with France's foreign minister later confirming they were \"safe\" at the embassy in Tehran \"ahead of their final release\".\"I welcome this first step. The dialogue continues to allow for their return to France as quickly as possible,\" Macron said.The pair, who were arrested in May 2022 during a tourist trip, are believed to be the last French nationals held in Iran.Last month, they were found guilty of spying on behalf of both France and Israel, and were handed lengthy prison sentences, according to Iranian state media reports.A number of Europeans have been held by Iran in recent years. France has accused Iran of state hostage-taking and keeping its nationals in conditions akin to torture, something Tehran has denied. In a statement to the AFP news agency on Tuesday, the pair's Paris-based legal team said the release of Kohler and Paris had \"ended their arbitrary detention which lasted 1,277 days\". AFP said their families have insisted they are wholly innocent.Their freeing comes more than a month after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a deal to exchange French detainees for an Iranian woman held in France was nearly complete. Iran had said Kohler and Paris could be released as part of that agreement.Mahdieh Esfandiari, who has been held in France since February on charges of promoting terrorism on social media, was released conditionally by French authorities last month.",

    "body": "Trump U-turns to renominate billionaire for Nasa chief1 hour agoTiffany WertheimerReutersJared Isaacman is reportedly friends with Elon Musk and has spent millions of dollars on SpaceX missionsDonald Trump has renominated billionaire investor Jared Isaacman to run Nasa, five months after withdrawing his first nomination.The 42-year-old entrepreneur, who has ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, had looked set to lead the space agency when Trump abruptly pulled his nomination in late May, following what the president said was a \"thorough review of prior associations.\"While the White House did not specify what those associations were, it was during Trump's high-profile feud with Musk.Isaacman, who is worth an estimated $1.9bn (£1.46bn), is an amateur jet pilot and also became the first non-professional astronaut to walk in space last year, on a mission with SpaceX that he bankrolled.Why Trump has suddenly changed his mind is unclear, and the president made no mention of the past when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he was \"pleased to nominate\" Isaacman for the role.\"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" the president wrote.The Nasa administrator role will be Isaacman's first job in politics, representing a departure from the last two men appointed to the job.It requires confirmation by the Senate, where the Republican Party holds a 53-47 majority. Even though the US government has been shut down since early October, the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees.Thanking the president, Isaacman wrote on X that \"it will be an honor\" to serve in the role.\"The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming,\" he wrote in a long post, that also acknowledged Nasa scientists and innovators. \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"Sean Duffy, the head of the transport department, has been interim Nasa chief since July.Isaacman's initial nomination withdrawal came just days after Elon Musk left the Trump administration, following a tumultuous drive to shrink the size of government departments with his Doge initiative, leading to thousands of job cuts.Concerns were voiced over Isaacman's ties to Musk and his SpaceX company, where Isaacman has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars. He has also made donations to the Democrats in past elections.His nomination has encountered scepticism, and at his initial confirmation hearing in April, members of both parties questioned Isaacman about possible conflicts of interest, budget cuts and his desire to send astronauts to Mars.They expressed fears he would sacrifice the long-planned Moon mission to focus on Mars, but Isaacman said both can be possible.\"We don't have to make a binary decision of Moon versus Mars, or Moon has to come first versus Mars,\" he later added.The billionaire - who was a high-school dropout - made his fortune from payment processing company Shift4 Payments, which he founded in 1999 in his parents' basement when he was 16.Isaacman has a longstanding interest in flying - having first taken pilot lessons in 2004 and later setting a world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the world in a light jet.More on this story",

    "body": "16 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, OttawaCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has put forward his first federal budget, which lays out an ambitious plan to transform Canada's economy and deal with the challenge of US tariffs.Billed an \"investment budget\" by the government, the fiscal plan increases Canada's deficit to C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), the second largest in history. The spending is offset by plans to attract C$1tn of investment into Canada over the next five years, with the federal government arguing more restrained spending would eliminate \"vital social programmes\" and funding for Canada's future. The budget does outline cuts, however, including slashing the size of the federal workforce by some 10% in the coming years. The budget was presented by Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, in the House of Commons late on Tuesday afternoon. In his budget speech, Champagne warned that Canada is facing \"a time of profound change\" and that \"bold and swift action is needed\" to ensure the country prospers.Peppered throughout the budget are references to uncertainty and the need for protectionist measures as a result of US tariffs on Canada. President Donald Trump has placed a broad 35% levy on Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, and has tariffed specific sectors like steel, aluminium and automobiles. These levies, enacted earlier this year, have already led to Canadian job losses in those sectors, and business leaders have warned of a chill on investment in Canada due to trade uncertainty. To counter this, the budget proposes spending of C$280bn over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\". These include updating ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade, as well as direct financing to support firms impacted by tariffs.The fiscal update also outlines a plan to boost Canada's competitiveness, with the goal of making Canada a more attractive place to do business than the US.Rebekah Young, the head of inclusion and resilience economics at Scotiabank, said the budget lays out a plan to reduce timelines and smooth regulatory hurdles with the hopes that it will boost private investment in Canada over the years.But she cautioned that parts of the budget might be a hard sell for Canadians struggling immediately with the cost of living.\"They're going to open this budget and not see any new (supports),\" she said. And while the budget delivers on its promise of generational spending, Ms Young said it remains to be seen if it will be as \"transformational\" as Carney hopes.\"We want to unlock a trillion dollars based on this investment here. A lot has to happen to get to that trillion,\" she said. On defence, the budget pledges nearly C$82bn over five years—the largest funding in decades—putting Canada in line with its Nato commitment to spend 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on its military by this year.The Carney government is also betting big on AI, proposing nearly C$1bn to boost integration and use of the rapidly growing technology, including in government operations.Carney warned Canadians ahead of the budget of \"sacrifices\". Among them is a reduction of the size of the federal government that would result in 40,000 job losses by 2029. International aid is also slated to be cut to pre-pandemic levels. Immigration targets have been lowered slightly over the next three years to \"stabilise\" new admissions to the country, including a significant cut to student visas.The budget will need to be passed by Canada's parliament before it's implemented. Carney's Liberal government is just shy of a majority, meaning it will need the support of other parties to enact its fiscal plan. Failure to pass the budget could risk a federal election. One Conservative MP, Chris d'Entremont, said in a statement released by the Liberals on Tuesday night that he had resigned from the Conservative caucus and will be crossing the floor to Carney’s party.In the statement, the MP said that the  budget “hits the priorities I have heard most in my riding“.​​This narrows Carney's razor-thin minority at a critical time.Meanwhile, Conservative opposition MPs have criticised the budget for increasing Canada's deficit while doing little to address affordability for Canadians. Yves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois party, said his caucus does not see how they could support the budget. Members of the left-leaning New Democratic Party said they will take the time to study it, but have criticised planned public sector cuts. With the projected larger deficit, Carney's fiscal plan maintains that Canada's still has the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the G7, behind only Japan.",

    "body": "10 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterA collection of diaries has won the prestigious Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction for the first time.How to End a Story: Collected Diaries by Helen Garner charts the Australian writer's life from the early stages of her career in bohemian Melbourne, to raising her daughter in the 1970s, and her experience of a disintegrating marriage in the 1990s.Garner's previous work includes 2014's The House of Grief, which told the story of Robert Farquharson on trial for the murder of his three sons.Famous fans include fellow writer David Nicholls, and singer Dua Lipa, who said: \"Helen Garner's work is a thrilling discovery. She's one of the most fascinating writers I have come across.\"Chair of judges, Robbie Millen, said How to End a Story was the judges' unanimous winner, praising it as \"a remarkable, addictive book\".\"Garner takes the diary form, mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday, to new heights,\" he continued. \"She is a brilliant observer and listener - every page has a surprising, sharp or amusing thought. Her collected diaries will surely be mentioned alongside The Diary of Virginia Woolf.\" In her review, the Observer's Rachel Cooke also referenced the revered Modernist author, describing Garner's collection as \"the greatest, richest journals by a writer since Virginia Woolf's\".This marks the first major UK-based prize win for the Australian, who has been belatedly receiving attention in the UK following the British publication of three of her books for the first time last year.The Baillie Gifford Prize rewards the best of non-fiction and is open to authors of any nationality. As the winner, Garner will receive £50,000, with the other shortlisted authors each receiving £5,000, bringing the total prize value to £75,000.The selection was made from over 350 books published between 1 November 2024 and 31 October 2025.The others who made the shortlist were:The Revolutionists: The Story of the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970s by Jason Burke, about a group of extremists including Carlos the Jackal and the Baader-Meinhof Gang.The Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief by Richard Holmes, a biography about the young Alfred Lord TennysonCaptives and Companions: A History of Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Islamic World by Justin Marozzi, it covers slavery in the Islamic world from the 7th Century to the present dayLone Wolf: Walking the Faultlines of Europe by Adam Weymouth, this book follows a young wolf's 1000-mile trek across the European AlpsElectric Spark by Frances Wilson, a biography of novelist Muriel Spark",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he has visited troops near the town of Pokrovsk, where the fiercest front line battle between Russia and Ukraine is currently taking place.Zelensky posted photos showing him meeting personnel at a command post in the Dobropillya sector, some 20km (12 miles) north of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.Kyiv's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskiy, said on Monday that Ukraine was increasing pressure on the Dobropillya front to \"force the enemy to disperse its forces and make it impossible to concentrate their main efforts in the Pokrovsk area\".Russia has been trying to seize Pokrovsk - a strategic frontline town and logistic hub - for over a year.Although it has taken them months to approach the town's borders, Russian soldiers have now infiltrated it and on Friday, Zelensky said Russia had amassed 170,000 troops on its outskirts.Both Ukraine and Russia continue to issue claims and counter claims on the situation in and around Pokrovsk.    Capturing Pokrovsk could give Moscow access to the rest of Donetsk, including the towns Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - the so-called \"fortress belt\". Gen Syrskiy, acknowledged his troops were withstanding the \"pressure of a multi-thousand enemy grouping\" but denied they were encircled. Meanwhile, Russian military bloggers claimed 90% of Pokrovsk was under Moscow's control. Unverified videos posted on social media show instances of close quarter combat, drone attacks and street battles there. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Russian forces were operating with \"increasing comfort\" within the town, which once had a population of 60,000 but has now been almost entirely emptied of civilians and largely destroyed.Further east, Moscow's troops are also reportedly targeting the town of Myrnohrad, which would put Ukrainian soldiers at risk of encirclement. Intense drone activity has cut off many logistics routes, making evacuations and the supply of ammunition and vehicles near impossible.On Monday, Zelensky said Russia had had \"no success\" in Pokrovsk in recent days but acknowledged that \"things were not easy\" for Ukrainian forces in the area. He added that a third of all front line clashes were happening in Pokrovsk, and a half of all glide bombs used by the Russians were launched at the town. Earlier last week the Ukrainian president said that Moscow's troops in the area were outnumbering Kyiv's eight to one.Some Ukrainian commentators have criticised the government's efforts to continue to defend Pokrovsk, arguing that troops were being put at risk.In a post accompanying the pictures of his visit to Dobropillya, Zelensky on Tuesday wrote: \"This is our country, this is our East, and we will certainly do our utmost to keep it Ukrainian.\"Russia now controls 81% of the Donetsk region and 99% of neighbouring Luhansk, which collectively make up the Donbas.Moscow has never relented in its ambition to capture the entirety of the area, which Russia's President Vladimir Putin declared annexed in 2022 despite not being in full control of it.However, its progress along the front line has been grinding and occupying the heavily fortified towns in northern Donetsk could come at a huge cost of both manpower and resources.Away from the front line, Russia continues to pummel Ukrainian cities, targeting the country's energy facilities as winter draws in.A large-scale drone attack overnight Monday targeted the southern port of Odesa on the Black Sea, damaging industrial facilities, causing fires and affecting the local power supply. At least 15 civilians were killed and 44 injured in combined drone and missile attacks across the country at the weekend. Ukraine continues to hit back, mostly using drones to target industrial sites across Russia and border regions. On Tuesday, Kyiv said it had attacked a petrochemical plant in the Bashkortostan region and a refinery in the Nizhny Novgorod region, while earlier this week, a drone explosion killed a woman and injured three others in the Russian border region of Belgorod.",

    "body": "Israel has confirmed the latest body of a hostage returned by Hamas via the Red Cross is that of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen.The 19-year-old's remains were handed over on Tuesday as part of a Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by US President Donald Trump last month.\"Following the completion of the identification process... [Israel Defense Forces] representatives informed the family of the fallen hostage, Staff Sergeant Itay Chen, that their loved one has been returned to Israel and positively identified,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said.Earlier, Hamas's military wing said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.Israel had allowed members of the Palestinian armed group and Red Cross staff to search for the remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.Staff Sgt Chen was serving as a soldier in the IDF's 7th Brigade when Hamas-led gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023. The IDF said he was killed inside a tank during a battle in Kibbutz Nir Oz and that his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage by Hamas.\"The remains of Itay Chen, a young American taken hostage by Hamas at just 19 years old, have finally returned home. We honour his life, mourn his loss, and stand with his family,\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel welcomed his return but also stressed that there were seven deceased hostages still in Gaza. \"Please don't stop until they are all back home. Until the last hostage,\" it said.On Wednesday morning, Nasser hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis said it had received the bodies of another 15 dead Palestinians from Israel via the Red Cross.For each dead Israeli hostage returned, Israel has agreed to hand over the remains of 15 Palestinians. But with no DNA testing available in Gaza, it is hard to identify them. The Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages since the ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October.Hamas has insisted it is difficult to locate the bodies under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Trump's Gaza peace plan, including plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.The US has now reportedly drafted a UN Security Council resolution that would give a two-year mandate for a transitional governance body in Gaza, known as the Board of Peace, and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF). The text says the ISF would be tasked with working with Israel and Egypt to secure border areas, \"ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip\", protecting civilians, and training a new Palestinian police force. It also says the ISF would be authorised to \"use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\". It is understood the draft has not yet been formally sent to other Security Council members for negotiations.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese. Five of the seven dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a hospital official in Gaza City said a man was killed by Israeli fire in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza.The Israeli military said its troops killed a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory, and posed a threat to them.",

    "body": "21 hours agoJames GregoryPortuguese Judiciary PoliceThe sub was located 1,000 nautical miles off the coast of LisbonFour people have been detained after Portuguese authorities intercepted a narco-sub carrying more than 1.7 tonnes of cocaine in the mid-Atlantic.The semi-submersible vessel was bound for the Iberian peninsula and was seized in recent days, according to officials.Footage shows the police and navy surrounding the vessel before boarding, seizing the Class A substance and arresting four crew members, who are said to be from South America.The suspects, including two Ecuadorians, a Venezuelan and a Colombian, were remanded in pre-trial custody after their court appearance in the Azores on Tuesday, said police.Vítor Ananias, head of Portugal's police unit to combat drug trafficking, told a press conference that their different nationalities showed the organisation behind them was not just based in one country.The Lisbon-based Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (MAOC) said it had received information in recent days indicating that a criminal organisation was in the process of dispatching a submersible loaded with cocaine destined for Europe.A few days later, a Portuguese ship successfully located the submersible approximately 1,000 nautical miles (1,852km) off the coast of Lisbon, in an operation backed by the UK's National Crime Agency and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.Having seized the vessel, the navy said it could not be towed back to shore due to poor weather and its fragile construction, and it later sank in the open sea.Portuguese navyThe Portuguese navy said the narcosub was too fragile  to be towed to port and ended up sinking in the seaVítor Ananias told reporters that \"between the heat, the vessel's fumes and high waves, with difficult weather conditions, even one day is tricky [for the four men on board]. By the end of 15 or 20 days all you want is to get out\".Such incidents like these had been a \"recurring situation in recent years\", he added, in remarks quoted by Lusa news agency.In March this year, a similar vessel carrying 6.5 tonnes of cocaine was seized about 1,200 nautical miles from Lisbon. It also comes as the Trump administration ramps up its attacks on vessels it says  are being used to smuggle drugs into the US. Three men were killed last week in a US strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Sunday.Experts have questioned the legality of such strikes under international law and they have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted.Watch: Moment Portuguese police enter narco-sub carrying 1.7 tonnes of cocaine in Atlantic",

    "body": "What tariffs has Trump announced and why?8 hours agoJennifer ClarkeBBC NewsGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump has threatened to impose fresh tariffs on eight allies that oppose his demands for control of Greenland.Last year, he placed taxes on goods reaching the US from countries around the world, arguing the move would boost American manufacturing and create jobs.Critics warned of higher prices and damage to the global economy.Tariffs are taxes on imported goods.Typically, the charge is a percentage of a good's value.For example, a 10% tariff on a $10 product would mean a $1 tax on top - taking the total cost to $11 (£8.17).The tax is paid to the government by companies bringing in the foreign products.These firms may pass some or all of the extra cost on to their customers, which in this case means ordinary Americans and other US businesses. They may also decide to import fewer goods.Why is Trump using tariffs? Trump says tariffs increase the amount of tax raised by the government, encourage consumers to buy more American-made goods and boost investment in the US.He wants to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them.The president argues that the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners.Trump has also used tariffs to make other demands.He has threatened fresh tariffs of 10% on the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland, because they oppose a US takeover of Greenland. Trump said the tariffs would be in place by 1 February and would rise to 25% by 1 June. When announcing tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada, he said the countries must do more to stop migrants and the illegal drug fentanyl reaching the US.Many tariffs have been amended or delayed after being announced.Why has the Supreme Court been considering the legality of Trump's tariffs?Trump's tariffs have faced numerous legal challenges.Instead of getting Congressional approval, the Trump administration used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Declaring an emergency under the law meant Trump could issue immediate orders and bypass Congress.In August 2025, a US appeals court ruled that most of Trump's tariffs were illegal, but left them in place. The White House asked the US Supreme Court to overturn that decision. A ruling is expected in the coming weeks. Trump has posted on social media that it would be a \"complete mess\" if the Supreme Court struck down his tariffs, and warned of difficulties if businesses were told they could claim refunds. \"It would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,\" Trump said.What are Trump's tariffs on countries?Negotiations are continuing with a number of countries, including America's top three trading partners. China, Canada and Mexico were all warned that they faced particularly high tariffs:China and the US threatened tariffs on each other's goods of more than 100% in the months after Trump took office at the start of 2025, but subsequently extended a truce until November. On 30 October, after meeting President Xi Jinping, Trump said the two countries would sign a trade deal \"pretty soon\". He announced an immediate end to the part of tariffs levied on Chinese goods over concerns about Beijing's failure to stop the flow of ingredients used to make fentanyl. Tariff exclusions on 178 Chinese products have been extended until 10 November 2026. Other much lower tariffs remain in place for non-exempt goodsCanada is facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under the existing United States-Canada-Mexico (USMCA) free trade agreement. Canada is affected by the blanket 50% levy on imported metals and 25% on non-US automobiles. On 25 October, Trump said he was suspending trade talks and would increase Canada's levies \"by 10% over and above what they are paying now\", after the country broadcast an anti-tariff advert. Prime Minister Mark Carney later apologised to TrumpMexico is facing 30% tariffs on its goods, plus the sector-specific levies and a  25% fentanyl tariff. However, like Canada, most of its goods are exempt under the USMCA. The tariffs were put on hold until the end of October to allow time to strike a deal. On 27 October, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she and Trump had agreed to extend this deadline by \"a few more weeks\". Talks are ongoingA patchwork of different rates is in place for other countries. Many of these stem from Trump's announcement in April 2025 that a \"baseline\" of 10% would apply to imports from all countries. Nations considered the \"worst offenders\" would face higher rates, as payback for unfair trade policies.New tariff rates for dozens of countries were subsequently introduced in August, after delays to allow for trade talks. These include:50% tariffs on Indian goods - including a 25% penalty for trade with Russia50% tariffs on Brazilian goods30% tariffs on South African goods20% tariffs on Vietnamese goods15% tariffs on Japanese goods15% tariffs on South Korean goods15% tariffs on most EU goodsOn 13 January, Trump announced the US would apply a 25% tariff to countries which continue to trade with Iran, after Tehran cracked down on anti-government protests, with thousands of people feared dead.On 17 January, the US president said he would impose a 10% tariff on eight countries who are opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland.The extra tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached.What is the UK tariff deal? ReutersIn June 2025, the UK negotiated a 10% US tariff rate, the lowest so far of any country that has struck a deal with Trump.It exported about £58bn of goods to the US in 2024 - mainly cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals.The 10% rate applies to the first 100,000 UK vehicles exported every year - roughly the number of cars sold in 2024. Additional vehicles face the standard 25% tariff.The agreement also lets the two countries sell beef to each other. Some US ethanol will face 0% tariffs, instead of 19%.Trump announced \"the deal was done\" in June, but did not confirm the expected removal of all charges on steel imports from the UK. The UK is the only country which does not face 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium. It pays 25% instead.The BBC understands the plan to eliminate tariffs on UK steel exports entirely has now been put on hold. However, speaking to reporters ahead of his second state visit to the UK in September, Trump said he was \"into helping\" Britain fine-tune the deal.Which goods are affected by Trump's tariffs?ReutersThe US is the biggest importer of steel in the world after the EU, with most coming from Canada, Brazil, Mexico and South KoreaIn addition, Trump ended an exemption for imports valued at $800 (£592) or less.It means low-cost goods are no longer duty-free - a move affecting millions of packages sent every day, including those from online retailers like Shein and Temu. The companies shipping the parcels now have to pay duties based on the tariff rate which applies to the country the goods were sent from. Otherwise, for six months, they can choose to pay a fixed fee of between $80 and $200 per package. On 2 January, the White House confirmed it had slashed proposed tariffs of almost 92% on some imported pasta. The government had alleged that certain Italian-made goods were being sold at \"less than normal value\" in the US, undercutting local producers, but reduced the level of the tariffs after what it called constructive engagement with the firms in question.In November, Trump signed an executive order exempting a range of other food products from tariffs, including avocados, bananas, beef and coffee. The administration said it acted because the specified goods could not be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Are prices going up for US consumers?Shoppers have seen price rises for some products, including toys, appliances and furniture as well as certain foodstuffs. US inflation was 3% in the 12 months to September, having gone up since April, when it stood at 2.4%. It fell back to 2.7% in November, and remained at that level in December, which was lower than many analysts had expected. Many firms have said they will pass on the cost of tariffs to US customers, including Target, Walmart and Adidas. The cost of goods manufactured in the US using imported components is also expected to rise.For example, car parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.How are tariffs affecting the US and global economies?Trump was accused of throwing the global economy into turmoil when he announced the first tariffs of his second presidential term.Although financial markets have since largely recovered, in October 2025 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the overall picture remained volatile, and that US tariffs were having a negative effect. It forecast global growth of 3.2% for 2025, and 3.1% in 2026. That was a slight increase from its July predictions, but still below the 3.3% it had projected for both years before Trump's measures were announced.It thinks the US economy will grow by 2% in 2025, and 2.1% in 2026. That's down from the 2.8% growth recorded in 2024, but still the fastest among the world's most advanced economies.The most recent US figures show the economy picked up speed over the three months to September 2025, as consumer spending jumped and exports increased.The economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years.Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline during the period. ",

    "description": "The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence ",
    "body": "The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence to criticise \"lies\" about their clients. Jessica and Jacques Moretti were  \"devastated\", the lawyers told local media, but denied being aware of any dangers at their venue.\"There is a sort of public vindictiveness directed against them,\" one of the three lawyers, Yaël Hayat, said.Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling of the basement of Le Constellation bar in the popular ski resort of Crans-Montana. Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are being treated in hospital for severe burns.Many stories about the couple, the venue they managed, as well as their past have circulated in the local media since the fire, increasing pressure on the authorities as they investigate the accident and prosecute the owners.In an interview with Tribune de Geneve, the lawyers said the couple wanted to \"restore the truth\".Hayat said reports her client Jessica had left the burning building with cash from the register were a lie, telling BFMTV: \"In no way did she leave the scene in a hurry; she stayed there to help and support the injured.\"Patrick Michod, representing Jacques Moretti, said: \"When you run an establishment and a tragedy like this occurs, you feel responsible. Now, the major question in this case is the question of criminal responsibility, which is obviously not the same thing as the feelings one may have as the operator.\"Asked about the foam in the ceiling, Michod said his client obtained the material from a \"major construction retailer\" which did not disclose that it was flammable. \"He did not want to install a highly flammable foam. He wanted to install acoustic foam,\" he said. Lawyers representing the family of Cyane Panine, a staff member at Le Constellation who died in the blaze, said she had received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught fire. Hayat described Panine as a close friend of the couple, and pulled out a postcard she said had been written by her to the Morettis, Tribune de Geneve reported. \"I hope I will continue to grow alongside you and that we will spend many more New Year's Eves together [...] you are like my second family,\" the postcard said.The Moretti couple have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Last week, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued the couple present a flight risk and have asked judges to impose a 400,000-franc bail ($500,000; £374,000)as a condition for their release - 200,000 for each.Michod said that he had filed a request to release Jacques Moretti.

    "body": "Three shark attacks have been reported in Sydney in a little over 24 hours, leaving at least two people seriously injured, according to local authorities.A man was taken to hospital in critical condition after being injured at Manly beach on Monday evening, New South Wales Police said in a statement.Hours earlier, an 11-year-old surfer had to be assisted off Sydney's Dee Why Beach after a suspected shark bit his surfboard, with the local council urging swimmers and surfers to be cautious.The first incident saw a 12-year-old boy taken to hospital with critical injuries after he was attacked by a large shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon, police said.The boy and his group of friends were jumping off a six-metre rock ledge at Shark Beach, in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse, when the attack happened on Sunday.Despite its name, shark attacks are rare at Shark Beach, a popular swimming spot.The boy was pulled out of the water by his friends before rescuers arrived. Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,\" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.\"Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.\"Marine police arrived to a \"horrendous scene\", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least five fatal shark attacks in the country last year.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSteve RosenbergRussia EditorReutersListen to Donald Trump and you would think Moscow and Beijing were lying in wait off the coast of Greenland, ready to pounce to boost their power in the Arctic.\"There are Russian destroyers, there are Chinese destroyers and, bigger, there are Russian submarines all over the place,\" President Trump said recently.That is why, according to America's president, US control of Greenland is essential.So how do you think Moscow has reacted to its alleged plot being uncovered and potentially thwarted by a US takeover of Greenland?The Russians can't be pleased. Right?Wrong.In an astonishing article, the Russian government paper is full of praise for Trump and critical of European leaders who oppose a US annexation of Greenland.\"Standing in the way of the US president's historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on 'drowning' the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life.\"\"Greatest deal\"? The reporter explains what he means. I have to keep reminding myself I am reading the Russian government newspaper, not a pro-Trump publication in America.\"If Trump annexes Greenland by July 4 2026, when America celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, he will go down in history as a figure who asserted the greatness of the United States,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"With Greenland, the US becomes the second largest country in the world after Russia, surpassing Canada in area. For Americans, that's on par with such planetary events as the abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 or the territorial conquests of the Napoleonic Wars.\"If, thanks to Trump, Greenland becomes part of America…for sure the American people will not forget such an achievement.\"And the Russian reporter has this message for America's president: don't U-turn.\"It is dangerous for the American president to back down over Greenland. This would weaken the position of the Republican Party in the midterm elections and likely result in a Democrat majority on Capitol Hill with the ensuing consequences for Trump. Whereas a rapid annexation of Greenland before the elections can change this political trend.\"In other words, it's in Trump's interest to push ahead with his plans to take over Greenland: according to the Russian government paper.Let that sink in.But why the praise from Moscow? Why the apparent encouragement?It's because Russia has much to gain from the current situation.Trump's fixation with Greenland, his determination to take over the island and impose tariffs on European countries that oppose his plan have put a huge strain on the transatlantic alliance: both on America's relations with Europe, and within Nato.Anything that weakens – or threatens to split – the Western alliance is viewed by Moscow as a huge positive for Russia.\"Europe is at a total loss and, to be honest, it's a pleasure to watch this,\" gloated the Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets in one of its articles about Greenland.What's more, American threats to annex Greenland are being used by pro-Kremlin commentators to try to justify Russia's war on Ukraine.Victory in Ukraine remains the Kremlin's priority. Moscow believes that maintaining a positive relationship with the Trump administration will help achieve this.Hence Russia's criticism of Europe. But not of Donald Trump.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here.

Boric said the death toll was expected to increase.The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.Local media have shown pictures of charred cars in the streets.Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío.The fires have burnt through 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) in the two regions so far.\"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe\" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X.\"All resources are available,\" he added.Under a state of catastrophe, Chile's armed forces can be deployed to help.The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000.Strong winds have fanned the flames, exacerbated by high summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts.Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the coming days.Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought.Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.",

    "body": "Thirteen school pupils have died in South Africa after the minibus they were travelling in collided with a lorry south of the city of Johannesburg.The crash happened on Monday morning at around 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) in Vanderbijlpark, the local education authority said.Eleven students died at the scene, while two succumbed to their injuries later on. Two other pupils remains in critical condition.The minibus driver crashed into the lorry after attempting to overtake two vehicles, police spokesperson Mavela Masondo said.Masondo added that a case of culpable homicide would be opened.The minibus driver was \"reportedly\" being treated in hospital, Gauteng province's department of education said, while the details of what happened to the lorry driver were \"uncertain\".Fatal road collisions are common in South Africa, due to factors such as rampant speeding, reckless driving and poorly maintained vehicles.In 2025, 11,418 people died in crashes - about 6% lower than a year earlier but still equivalent to an average of 31 deaths a day.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Monday's crash \"distressing\". \"Our children are the nation's most precious assets and we must do all we can – from observing the rules of the road to the quality of service providers appointed to transport scholars – to protect learners,\" the president added.",

    "body": "23 hours agoNick BeakeEurope correspondent, in BrusselsIt's not yet a full year since European leaders buckled up for President Trump's second term, and now this rollercoaster ride feels it has reached its most dangerous turn yet.The occupant on the White House is dangling the threat of economic punishment over the heads of countries that are supporting the territorial integrity of an EU member, Denmark. Leaders will hold an emergency EU summit about this in the coming days. If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US.If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force?French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's \"trade bazooka\" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts.There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power.They were thinking of China, not the US.In the here and now, some EU leaders are wary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump.She has spoken of a \"problem of understanding and communication\" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood.If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat.Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis.Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts.It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it.EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous.Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic.But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.",

    "body": "5 hours agoThomas Naadi,BBC Africa, Accra andJean OtalorCyber Security AuthorityThe authorities released pictures of some of those found in the raids along with their equipmentGhana's security forces have arrested nine Nigerians suspected of co-ordinating a host of cyber-crime activities from makeshift offices in and around the capital, Accra.Forty-four others, believed to be victims brought to Ghana from Nigeria under false pretences, have also been detained and handed over to the immigration authority.During the two-day intelligence-led operation, raids uncovered 62 laptops, 52 mobile phones and two pump-action guns, the authorities have said.There is a growing trend of foreigners being lured to Ghana under the pretext of lucrative work. They are then put in gated compounds, have their documents confiscated and are compelled to engage in cyber-crime.They often work on romance scams, where a victim is encouraged to send money to a fictitious partner who they believe is real, or business email compromise, where someone poses as an employer and gets people to sends funds or sensitive data.The weekend's operation was jointly co-ordinated by a host of agencies, including the Cyber Security Authority (CSA).''All the arrested individuals have been duly profiled and handed over to the Ghana Immigration Service for safekeeping and further investigations,\" Communications Minister Sam George said in a post on X.\"We caution foreign nationals invited to Ghana to verify claims made by their fellow nationals to lure them here.''George also indicated that suspects arrested in previous recent operations have been handed over to Nigerian law enforcement or are facing prosecution.The CSA and other agencies have been making efforts to flush out cyber-criminals, including working with the US authorities to arrest high-profile suspects. Among recent operations was the arrest of a popular Ghanaian social media influencer known as Abu Trica, whose real name is Frederick Kumi, who allegedly stole $8m (£5.9m) from vulnerable Americans through a romance scam. He has not yet commented on the allegations.Another successful operation was the dismantling of a syndicate that defrauded over 200 victims of $400,000 (£300,000).You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcastsMore from the BBC",

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will dissolve parliament on Friday, paving the way for an early election on 8 February that she hopes will translate her strong public polling into a big majority in the lower house.It was an \"extremely weighty decision\" that would \"determine Japan's course together with the people\", Takaichi told a news conference in Tokyo.The country's first female leader and her cabinet have enjoyed high public support since taking office last October.But her party lags behind in polls and the move is risky. It's Japan's second general election in as many years and will test appetite for her plans to boost public spending when cost-of-living is top of voters' minds.Having been elected as prime minister by lawmakers on 21 October, Takaichi is now seeking a public mandate in the House of Representatives, the more powerful house in Japan.Since the day she took office, Takaichi said, she has been \"constantly concerned that the Takaichi cabinet has not yet been tested in an election where the public chooses the government\".\"Is Sanae Takaichi fit to be prime minister? I wanted to ask the sovereign people to decide,\" she told the news conference.Campaigning for the vote to elect the 465 lower house MPs, who serve four-year terms, starts on 27 January.Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955. It currently has 199 seats - including three held by its independent partners - in the House of Representatives, the most of any party. The LDP's coalition with the Japan Innovation party gives it a fragile majority, with just enough seats to govern. A protege of former conservative PM Shinzo Abe and self-professed admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known as Japan's \"Iron Lady\". She came into office promising an economic upturn after years of stagnation.Takaichi is an advocate of heavy government-led spending to drive economic growth - a revival of the sort of stimulus measures that Japan saw under \"Abenomics\". Her first few months in office have seen soaring personal poll ratings - no Japanese PM has been popular since Abe, in 2012.In December, her cabinet approved a record defence budget of nine trillion yen ($57bn; £43bn). This comes amid growing concern over China, with Tokyo describing its neighbour's military activities in the region as its \"greatest strategic challenge\".Takaichi has found herself the target of China's ire since last November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. The diplomatic spat that ensued has sent bilateral ties plunging to their lowest point in more than a decade.Meanwhile, Takaichi has pursued closer ties with the US. During US President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last October, the two leaders heaped praise on each other and signed a deal on rare earths. They also signed a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations.Opinion polls show that while the LDP remains broadly unpopular among Japanese residents, Takaichi and her government have charted approval ratings of 60-80%.This popularity is what Takaichi hopes can help the LDP secure a \"sole majority\" in parliament and push through bolder policies more easily, Dr Seijiro Takeshita, a management professor at the University of Shizuoka, told the BBC World Service's Asia Specific podcast.\"She wants to solidify her position to make things smoother at a later stage,\" Takeshita said.But the snap election gamble comes with its own set of risks.The LDP's leadership has been on shaky ground, and Takaichi is the country's fourth PM in five years. Her predecessors' terms were cut short by falling public support and scandals.Her immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, also announced a snap election shortly after taking office - leading to one of the LDP's worst ever results and costing the party its majority in the House of Representatives.Another challenge looms in the form of a new, consolidated opposition, the Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed last week by Japan's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and the Komeito party, the LDP's former coalition partner.Takaichi said the dissolution of parliament was being carried out only \"after establishing a thorough system\" which ensures there is no disruption to economic policies affecting livelihoods and rising prices.What Takaichi is hoping for is that \"people will trust her to deliver on her promises\", Dr Jeffrey Kingston, an Asian studies professor at Temple University in the US, told the BBC.Her high approval ratings are \"only going to decline so she wants to lock in the benefits of a long honeymoon\", he added.",

    "body": "12 hours agoHarry Sekulich,BBC News,Guy Hedgecoe,MadridandRachel Hagan,BBC NewsFootage shows emergency workers at scene of derailmentAt least 39 people have died in a train collision in southern Spain and dozens more have been injured in the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade, Spain's Civil Guard has said.Carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening.Four hundred passengers and staff were onboard both trains, the rail networks said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 43, including four children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 adults and one child are in intensive care.Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\", as officials launched an investigation.Puente described the incident as \"extremely strange\". All the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\", he told reporters in Madrid.Follow live updatesRail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the train left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, Puente said. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters news agency.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Córdoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.\"Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\". \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"ReutersPassengers were taken to hospital and advanced medical posts near the site of the crashAll rail services between Madrid and Andalusia were suspended following the accident and are expected to remain closed all day on Monday.Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Málaga, said around 300 passengers were on board the train that first derailed, while the other train – operated by the state-funded firm Renfe – had around 100 passengers.The official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month, according to the transport minister. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a \"night of deep pain\". The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident, describing it as \"a nightmare\".King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\".\"We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,\" the royal palace said on X.The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.EPAFriends and relatives have been seeking information about their loved ones on board either train.Advanced medical posts were set up for impacted passengers to be treated for injuries and transferred to hospital.

    "body": "50 minutes agoMallory MoenchREUTERS/Kevin LamarqueUS President Donald Trump has said he no longer feels obliged to think only of peace after he was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year.In a message to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Trump blamed the country for not giving him the prize. In his reply to Trump, Støre explained that an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awards the prize which last October went to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado.In the same message to Støre, Trump insisted the US needed \"Complete and Total Control of Greenland\" - the semi autonomous Danish territory. Asked later if he planned to use force to seize it, he replied \"no comment\". Denmark is a fellow member of Nato  - a defence alliance with the US as its most influential partner. It works on the principle that members should defend each-other in case of external attacks. There has never been an attack by one member against another since the alliance was founded in 1949.Denmark has warned that US military action in Greenland would spell the end of Nato. It has received support from European members of the alliance - some even sent a handful of troops to Greenland last week in a move seen as symbolic.However, Trump followed that deployment with an announcement to impose a 10% tariff on goods from eight Nato allies - including the UK - from 1 February if they opposed his proposed takeover of Greenland, and threatened to raise it to 25% by June.It was in this context of heightened tension that Jonas Støre sent a message to Trump was on behalf of himself and the Finnish President, Alexander Stubb.The two European leaders said \"we all should work to take this down and de-escalate - so much is happening around us where we need to stand together\". In his reply, Trump wrote: \"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper' for the US.\"He went on to say that Denmark could not protect Greenland from Russia or China, and questioned, \"why do they have a \"right of ownership\" anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also\". \"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,\" he said.\"The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,\" he concluded.The sparsely-populated but resource-rich Arctic island is well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday that any decision about the future status of Greenland \"belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone\", and called the use of tariffs against allies \"wrong\".Also on Monday, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen and Greenlandic Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Motzfeldt met Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte.Last week, the Danish and Greenlandic governments, together with Nato allies, decided to increase military presence and exercise activity in the Arctic and the North Atlantic.Several European states sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission.Trump has made no secret of his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and on Monday insisted that \"Norway totally controls it [the Nobel Prize] despite what they say\". \"They like to say they have nothing to do with it, but they have everything to do with it,\" he told NBC News.  Trump says he deserves the award, having ended eight wars since his second term as president began last year.The White House has previously listed these as conflicts between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Thailand and Cambodia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.BBC Verify has examined Trump's claim which include a number of \"wars\" which had lasted just days, although were the result of long-standing tensions, and in some cases – for example Egypt and Ethiopia - there was no fighting to end.There has also been fighting between Rwanda and the DRC, despite the two sides signing a peace agreement.How many wars has President Trump really ended?The peace prize was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. Later, when US forces seized and removed Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro from Caracas, accusing him of drug trafficking and other crimes, Trump did not endorse Machado as the country's next leader and instead backed Maduro's vice-president as the interim head of government. Machado, who has praised Trump, met him at the White House last week and gave her medal to him. The Nobel Foundation had said the award could not \"even symbolically, be passed on or further distributed\".What questions do you have about  Donald Trump's first year since returning as US president?

    "body": "China's birth rates sunk to a record low in 2025, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost it, as the country's population fell for the fourth straight year.Government data on Monday showed that the country's birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968.Its population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year.Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children.In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021.More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.",

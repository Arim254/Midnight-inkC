    "body": "56 minutes agoHarry SekulichEPAChris Minns, Premier of New South Wales, has pushed for tougher hate speech laws following the Bondi attacksThe Australian state where the Bondi shooting occurred plans to ban the phrase \"globalise the intifada\" as part of a crackdown on \"hateful\" slogans.New South Wales (NSW) premier Chris Minns has also called for a Royal Commission into the Bondi attack, marking the deadliest shooting in Australia in nearly 30 years.Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured last Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by \"Islamic State ideology\", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.Australia's state and federal governments have announced a raft of measures to counter extremism since the attack.Minns plans to recall the state parliament next week to pass through stricter hate speech and gun restrictions. Earlier this week, he also suggested he would tighten protest laws to scale back mass demonstrations to encourage \"a summer of calm\".The premier confirmed he would seek to classify the chant \"globalise the intifada\" as hate speech. Two pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly shouting slogans involving intifada at a demonstration in central London.The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.Earlier this week, Minns, along with the NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane, attended the funeral Matilda, 10, who was the youngest victim of the Bondi shooting. He read out a poem dedicated to the young girl at the event.Prime minister Anthony Albanese has announced a new gun buyback scheme to purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms. Hundreds of thousands of guns will be collected and destroyed, the government predicts.Around 1,000 lifeguards staged a tribute on Saturday, lining up arm-to-arm facing the ocean, on the shorelines of Bondi beach. Surf lifesaving teams at other beaches around Australia were photographed performing a similar memorial.Through the week, Bondi's surf volunteers have been commemorated as some of the heroes of the shooting. Lifeguard Jackson Doolan was photographed sprinting over from a neighbouring beach during the attack carrying a red medical supply bag.Hundreds of swimmers and surfers paddled out at Bondi beach yesterday to create a giant circle to pay tribute to the victims of the attack. On Sunday, Australia will hold a national day of reflection with the theme \"light over darkness\" marking precisely one week after the attack started with a minute's silence at 6:47 pm (0747 GMT).Flags will fly at half-mast and Australians are being asked to light a candle in their windows to honour the victims.\"Sixty seconds carved out from the noise of daily life, dedicated to 15 Australians who should be with us today,\" prime minister Albanese told reporters Saturday.\"It will be a moment of pause to reflect and affirm that hatred and violence will never define us as Australians.\"Bondi's attack was Australia's worst mass shooting since Port Arthur in 1996, where 35 people were killed and prompted then-prime minister John Howard to introduce strict gun control measures.",

    "body": "16 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesA Paris court has rejected an effort by the French government to suspend the website of fast-fashion giant Shein in response to it selling childlike sex dolls on its platform.The court said the request for a three-month suspension was \"disproportionate\" - but did order age verification for the sale of adult products.The action against Shein was taken after France's consumer watchdog last month reported it to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" and weapons. Shein said its priority remained protecting French consumers and ensuring compliance.The court acknowledged the seriousness of selling the childlike sex dolls and weapons in its judgement, but said these had been isolated incidents. It noted that the Chinese company had taken action to remove the offending items once it had been made aware of them, and that the issues related to a small number of the hundreds of thousands of products on sale on its site. In response to the initial controversy, Shein announced it would be banning the sale of all sex dolls on its site internationally. A request by the French government for Shein to be forced to suspend the sale of third-party items on its website - the source of the initial offending items - was also rejected. In ordering age verification measures to be put in place for the sale of adult items, the court said the fine for each breach would be €10,000 (£8,700; $11,700). The decision to suspend Shein's website in early November coincided with the company opening its first physical store in the French capital. Its launch drew both shoppers and protesters, with opposition related to the sale of childlike sex dolls, and also its profile as a fast-fashion retailer. Shein said in a statement: \"We remain committed to continuously improving our control processes, in close collaboration with the French authorities, with the aim of establishing some of the most stringent standards in the industry.\"Our priority remains protecting French consumers and ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoHugh Schofield,ParisandLaura GozziA former anaesthetist has been jailed for life for intentionally poisoning 30 patients, 12 of them fatally.Frédéric Péchier, 53,  was convicted Friday at the end of a four-month trial in the eastern city of Besançon.In one of France's biggest ever medical malpractice cases, Péchier was found to have introduced chemicals like potassium chloride or adrenaline into the infusion bags of patients. His youngest victim, a four-year-old child, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"The chemicals Péchier added triggered cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients, which required emergency intervention in the operating theatre.This was often provided by Péchier himself, who was then able to pose as the patient's saviour.But in 12 cases he was unable to intervene, or it was too late, and the patient died.The prosecution argued that Péchier acted in order to discredit fellow anaesthetists against whom he bore a grudge.In most of the operations, he was not the primary anaesthetist. It was alleged he came in early to the clinic to tamper with the infusion bags.Then, when things went wrong, he was able to step in after diagnosing the problem and ordering an antidote.Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. The alert was raised in 2017 after a surfeit of potassium chloride was found in the infusion bag of a woman who had a heart attack while being operated on for a back complaint.Investigators found a pattern of \"serious adverse events\" at the Saint-Vincent private clinic in Besançon. While the national average for fatal heart attacks under anaesthetic was 1 in 100,000, at the clinic it was more than six times that.And in most cases nationally, an explanation for the heart attack was subsequently found, whereas at Saint-Vincent the cause remained a mystery.It was also found that the \"serious adverse events\" ceased when Péchier left for a short period to work at another clinic, which itself then saw an uptick. Then when he returned to Saint-Vincent, the emergencies resumed there. When he was disbarred from practising in 2017, the anomaly stopped.Péchier's first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. \"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.According to the trial prosecutor: \"His colleagues said he always seemed to have the answer. That he made himself out to be the best, that he created this character of the saviour, so that colleagues would instinctively turn to him.\"Péchier denied the charges and his lawyers argued that there was no hard proof linking him to the crimes. But his own testimony varied in the trial, and he ended up admitting there must have been a poisoner at large in the clinic, but it was not him.The son of two parents in the medical profession, Péchier was described by a court psychologist as having a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality – one side respectable, the other side capable of doing great harm. In 2014 and again in 2021 he made attempts to kill himself.A divorced father of three children, he told the court before the verdict that his sole concern was to protect his family. His children wept as the sentence was read but he remained impassive.\"It's the end of a nightmare,\" said survivor Sandra Simard. Another patient who survived, Jean-Claude Gandon, said: \"We can have an easier Christmas now.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoCachella SmithEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe Trevi Fountain is one of Rome's key attractions with around nine million visitors this yearTourists in Italy's capital Rome will soon have to pay a €2 (£1.75; $2.34) entrance fee if they want to see its famed Trevi Fountain up close.The new barrier for visitors to view the Baroque monument will come into force from 1 February 2026.While the coins tossed into the fountain are donated to charity, the fees collected will go to the city authority to pay for upkeep and managing visitors. The city expects to raise €6.5m a year from the fountain alone.Announcing the move on Friday, Rome's Mayor Roberto ‌Gualtieri was quote by news agency Reuters as saying that \"two euros isn't very much ... and it will lead to less chaotic tourist flows\".The Trevi levy is part of a new tariff system for certain museums and monuments in the Italian capital.Access to a number of sites that currently charge for entry will become free for Rome's residents, such as the Sacred Area of Largo Argentina.At the same time, tourists and non-residents will have to pay to see the Trevi fountain and five other attractions including the Napoleonic Museum.Children under the age of five, and those with disabilities and an accompanying person, will be exempt from the fees.Tourists will still be able to view the Trevi Fountain - built by Italian architect Nicola Salvi in the 18th Century - for free from a distance.The site currently sees an average of 30,000 visitors per day, according to the City of Rome.Following restoration work which took place last year, Gualtieri introduced a queuing system to prevent large crowds massing around the landmark.Access is capped at 400 people at the same time.",

    "body": "The Australian government has announced a gun buyback scheme in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack - its deadliest mass shooting in decades.The scheme is the largest since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, which left 35 people dead and prompted Australia to introduce world-leading gun control measures.Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured on Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by \"Islamic State ideology\", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.On Friday, police also said there was no ongoing reason to detain a group of men who were arrested in Sydney over their \"extremist Islamic ideology\".Police allege Sunday's attack, which they have declared a terrorist incident, was committed by a father-son duo. Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.The day after the shooting, national cabinet - which includes representatives from the federal government and leaders from all states and territories - agreed to tighten gun controls.Speaking to media on Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there are now more than 4 million firearms in Australia - more than at the time of the Port Arthur massacre.\"We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns. \"If you're going to reduce the number of guns, then a buyback scheme has to be a piece of that puzzle,\" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett added.The new scheme will purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms, and will be funded on a 50-50 basis with the states and territories. Hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed, the government estimates.National cabinet has also agreed to impose limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual, restrict open-ended firearms licensing and the types of guns that are legal and make Australian citizenship a condition of holding a firearm licence. Work on a national firearms register will be accelerated and firearm regulators will have better access to criminal intelligence.On Friday, New South Wales Police said they were preparing to release seven men with extremist ideology, but that they would continue to be monitored.Tactical officers swarmed on the group, who had travelled from Victoria and were known to police there, in dramatic scenes in the suburb of Liverpool on Thursday. Officers found a knife, but no guns or other weapons.NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference there is \"no confirmed link\" between the alleged terrorists and the detained group, but that Bondi Beach was one of several locations the latter was intending to visit.\"Whilst this specific threat posed by the males is unknown, I can say that the potential [for] a violent offence being committed was such that we were not prepared to tolerate the risk,\" Commissioner Lanyon said.",

    "body": "The widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has said the Turning Point USA organisation he founded will help elect JD Vance as president in 2028, despite the current US vice-president having yet to announce he is running.Erika Kirk's endorsement on Thursday came on the opening day of Turning Point's annual America Fest conference, the organisation's largest gathering since her husband was shot dead in September.\"We are going to get my husband's friend, JD Vance, elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,\" Kirk said, referring to the 48th president. Trump is the 47th.Vance, meanwhile, is scheduled to speak at the event on Sunday.Turning Point has been credited with helping Republican President Donald Trump expand his coalition of support, leading to his 2024 presidential election victory.Her announcement ahead of Trump's one-year mark in office signals early jockeying to be his successor ahead of the 2028 election.After Kirk gave her opening remarks, the stage at the Phoenix Convention Center in Arizona turned into a political mudslinging contest as tensions within the conservative movement were laid bare.Podcaster Ben Shapiro lobbed attacks at media rivals Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly and Steve Bannon, calling them \"fraudsters and grifters\".  \"The people who refused to condemn Candace's truly vicious attacks - and some of them are speaking here tonight - are guilty of cowardice,\" Shapiro said.Owens, a former Turning Point employee who hosts a popular podcast, has been a thorn in Republicans' side and pushed various conspiracy theories, including baseless suggestions about Charlie Kirk's murder. It comes at a time when there has been growing speculation about Trump's hold on the Republican party and infighting among factions of the president's supporters about the future of the Maga movement.Shapiro also criticised former Fox News host Carlson for interviewing Nick Fuentes, a far-right political commentator and Holocaust denier, on his podcast in late October, drawing widespread condemnation. After Shapiro, Carlson took the stage and shot back at Shapiro.\"That guy is pompous,\" Carlson said. \"Calls to deplatform at a Charlie Kirk event? That's hilarious.\"  Charlie Kirk's Turning Point events were known for addressing controversial and divisive topics. Supporters saw it as necessary for free speech. Critics saw it as hate-mongering. Authorities said Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin - Tyler Robinson - told his romantic partner that he killed Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred\". Erika Kirk told the Turning Point conference: \"You won't agree with everyone on this stage this weekend. And that's okay. Welcome to America.\"Since the assassination, she said, \"we've seen fractures, we've seen bridges being burned that shouldn't be burnt\". Trump has recently encountered a series of setbacks within his Republican party, including a public falling out with his former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene and the impending release of the Epstein files, which a majority of Republicans voted for despite Trump's initial discouragement.The four-day America Fest conference was scheduled to continue through the weekend, with Vance and Donald Trump Jr scheduled as guest speakers on Sunday.

    "body": "15 hours agoBethany BellViennaGetty ImagesFernando P being escorted into the regional court in Aachen, western GermanyA court in the German city of Aachen has sentenced a man to eight-and-a-half years in prison for repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, filming the acts and then posting them online.The man, named only as Fernando P in line with German privacy laws, was found guilty of aggravated rape, grievous bodily harm and violation of personal privacy.The court found the 61-year-old, who is originally from Spain, guilty of sedating and raping his wife at their home for a period of several years from 2018 to 2024.A spokesperson for the court, Katharina Effert, said the man also filmed the abuse and shared it online. \"He uploaded videos of these acts to chat groups and internet platforms, making them available to other users,\" she said.Much of the trial was held behind closed doors to protect the identity of his wife.Her lawyer, Nicole Servaty, told journalists that she \"really had a voice in this proceeding\", adding: \"She was able to testify, to express her feelings and everything that has burdened her.\"She said the ruling could not make up for what happened. \"But it might help a bit to cope with things and process them.\"The verdict is still subject to appeal.Getty ImagesFernando P was seen with his hoodie obscuring his face as he awaited the verdict in courtGerman media say the case bears similarities to the high-profile case in France last year concerning Dominique Pelicot. He was found guilty of secretly drugging his wife, Gisèle, and inviting scores of men to rape her while she was unconscious for years.Gisèle's decision to waive her anonymity and hold a public trial turned her into a feminist icon, celebrated for her powerful testimony and courage.Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office, the BKA, says that the victims of sedation and subsequent sexual abuse are \"almost exclusively women\".It says such crimes \"usually take place by exploiting a relationship of trust\" in marriage, partnerships, families or among close acquaintances.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJack BurgessUS Immigration and Customs EnforcementA photo released by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement showing Kemal Mrndzic (right) on 2 November 1992The US justice department has launched a civil legal case against a man accused of being a Bosnian war criminal to revoke his citizenship.Kemal Mrndzic did not disclose during his US immigration process that he served as a guard at Bosnia's notorious Celebici prison camp, where atrocities were committed, the department said.A UN war crimes tribunal found that people held in the camp during the Bosnian war were killed, tortured, sexually assaulted, beaten and subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment.US President Donald Trump's administration would not allow people who \"persecute others\" to \"reap the benefits of refuge in the US\", justice department official Brett Shumate said.The assistant attorney general added that the legal case showed the value that the US government placed on \"the integrity of its naturalisation process\". Mrndzic was found guilty by a jury in October 2024 on several counts of criminal fraud and misrepresentation in relation to his successful application for a US passport and naturalisation certificate.He failed to disclose to immigration authorities the nature and timing of his military service, or that \"he persecuted Bosnian-Serb inmates as a prison guard\", the justice department said.Mrndzic was sentenced in January 2025 to more than five years in prison. US Immigration and Customs EnforcementA set of photos that appear to show Kemal Mrndzic through the years, from 1992 to 2019, released by US officialsThe Bosnian war followed the break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s and led to the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995.Srebrenica, recognised by the UN as a genocide, became known as Europe's worst mass atrocity since World War Two, after Bosnian-Serb forces systematically murdered more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys.The Celebici prison camp was operated by Bosniak and Bosnian-Croat forces, who were also responsible for widespread killings in areas they controlled.Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic was tried for war crimes and genocide, and the massacre led to the US-brokered Dayton Peace Agreement on 14 December 1995.",

    "body": "17 hours agoMalu CursinoGetty ImagesNorway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit will likely need a lung transplant as her health has worsened in recent months, the country's royal household has said.The princess, 52, was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2018. The degenerative disease creates scar tissue that stiffens the lungs making it difficult to breathe and for oxygen to enter the bloodstream.Tests in autumn showed \"a clear worsening\" of her health, the palace said on Friday. \"We are reaching the point where a lung transplant will be necessary,\" Are Martin Holm, head of respiratory medicine at Oslo University Hospital, said.Princess Mette-Marit told public broadcaster NRK that her illness had developed \"faster than I'd hoped\".No decision has been taken yet on whether she will be placed on the transplant waiting list, Dr Holm said. The palace said her doctors had started the process towards an evaluation for lung transplant surgery.In Norway, there are usually between 20 and 40 patients on the waiting list for a lung transplant and Princess Mette-Marit will not be given preferential treatment if she is placed on the list, local media reports.Although she is not yet on a donor list, Dr Holm said her healthcare team was \"undertaking the necessary preparations to ensure that [a transplant] will be possible when the time comes\".The palace said Princess Mette-Marit had \"an increasing need\" for rest and a targeted exercise regimen.However, she had \"expressed a strong interest in continuing to carry out her duties\", it added in a statement on Friday. Her royal duties and engagements will adapted to her ongoing health issues.Dr Holm described pulmonary fibrosis to reporters as a \"dangerous disease\" that often could not be seen because it depended on how sick an individual was. At rest, they might be able to breathe normally, he explained, but when they exert themselves - through exercise, for example - their lungs \"can no longer keep up\".ReutersHiking or skiing - activities Princess Mette-Marit enjoys with her husband, Crown Prince Haakon (left) - are no longer possiblePrincess Mette-Marit's husband, Prince Haakon, Norway's future king, sat beside her for an interview with NRK, in which he explained that she may appear \"perfectly fine\" when sitting still, but said he had noticed her struggling more with breathing.He also said she had less energy and was getting ill more often.Hiking or skiing together - activities the pair enjoy - were no longer possible, the crown prince added.The thought of the transplant alone had been demanding, Mette-Marit said, as she knew it will involve risks. A successful transplant hinges on several factors, including finding the right match and ensuring the body does not reject the new organ.Transplant is seen as a last resort, Dr Holm explained, telling reporters that individuals must be significantly ill and have a limited life expectancy before a lung transplant can be deemed appropriate.News of the princess's deteriorating health comes months after her eldest son was charged with 32 offences, including four counts of rape.Marius Borg Høiby, 28, denies the most serious accusations against him, but plans to plead guilty to some lesser charges when the trial begins, his lawyer Petar Sekulic told news agency Reuters in August.Mr Høiby is the stepson of the heir to the Norwegian throne, but does not have any royal title or official duties.",

    "body": "EU agrees €90bn loan for Ukraine but without using Russian assets19 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor,andChris GrahamReutersDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (left), European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announce the deal at the summit in Brussels European Union leaders have struck a late-night deal to lend Ukraine €90bn (£79bn; $105bn) over the next two years, after failing to agree on using frozen Russian assets.Ukraine was set to run out of cash by next spring, and European Council chief António Costa said the loan would be paid back only when Russia paid reparations for its full-scale war.\"We committed, we delivered,\" said Costa, while Ukrainian Prime Minister Yuliya Svyrydenko praised the deal as \"a decisive step for economic resilience\".A bid to use €210bn in Russian cash frozen in the EU, mainly in Belgium, ultimately failed as leaders could not convince Belgium's prime minister his country would be protected from Russian retaliation.The bulk of the cash is held by Brussels-based Euroclear and interest from the frozen assets is already being paid to Ukraine. Russia has already launched legal action against the clearing house.Russian President Vladimir Putin accused EU leaders of attempted robbery on Friday and Kirill Dmitriev, his envoy in talks with the US, claimed their failure to agree on using the assets was a \"fatal blow\".However, Belgium's Bart De Wever said the deal eventually agreed after almost 17 hours of negotiations was a \"victory for Ukraine, a victory for financial stability... and a victory for the EU\". EU ⁠leaders had avoided \"chaos ‍and ‍division\", he added.Ukraine needs an estimated €137bn over the next two years to cover both its military and its public services, and the EU plan is to cover two-thirds of that.The €90bn that the EU will raise on the capital markets as part of the loan deal will be \"backed by EU budget headroom\" - the margin between actual EU contributions by member states in a year and the maximum the European Commission can spend as part of the budget. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to European leaders for the \"significant support that truly strengthens our resilience\".Germany's Friedrich Merz had been a strong supporter of the plan to use Russia's frozen assets. Although the idea has not been dropped, the decision to borrow the money against the EU budget instead is seen as a setback for him. Nevertheless, he declared that it \"sends a clear signal from Europe to Putin\".Two countries, Hungary and Slovakia, refused to back the compromise deal, while the Czech Republic said it would not guarantee the loan.Hungary's Viktor Orban, seen as Vladimir Putin's closest partner in the EU, has opposed handing any more money to Ukraine, arguing it prolongs the war, and he has condemned the deal.Viktor Orban/XViktor Orban posted a photo of him in the centre, with Slovakia's Robert Fico on the right and Czech PM Andrej Babis on the left\"It looks like a loan, but the Ukrainians will never be able to pay it back,\" he told reporters. \"It is basically losing money.\"Like Orban, Slovakia's Robert Fico refused to back more funding to allow Ukraine to continue its defence against Russia, but Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis was careful to point out he agreed to the summit's conclusions \"on condition we don't guarantee the loans\".Billionaire populist Babis only just formed a government this week, and his stance is a signficant departure from the previous government's staunch support for Ukraine.The EU summit took place as US talks with Russia were set to continue, spearheaded by US President Donald Trump, who said this week that a solution was closer than ever.Dmitriev is expected to meet Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Miami at the weekend, according to reports.Meanwhile, a Ukrainian delegation is also due in Miami for talks with their US counterparts, days after Kushner and Witkoff met them and European leaders in Berlin.European allies have made a series of proposals to end the war that include a multinational force as part of \"robust security guarantees\" for Ukraine.Putin has criticised the European approach, saying he had already agreed to several compromises at his meeting with Trump in Alaska in August. Praising Trump's \"serious efforts to end this conflict\", the Russian leader said \"the ball is entirely and fully in the court of our Western opponents... the head of the Kyiv regime and its European sponsors\".Putin's demands were largely reflected in an initial US peace plan and include Ukraine handing over large areas of its own territory.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the deal agreed by the EU boosted the Ukrainian position: \"There ​is a chance that these negotiations will be ‌about peace not ‍on ‌Russian terms, but on terms that can somehow be accepted and considered ‍acceptable by all parties ‍to this conflict.\"Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed it would be \"useful\" for Europe to re-engage with Putin.\"I believe that it's in our interest as Europeans and Ukrainians to find the right framework to re-engage this discussion,\" he said, adding that Europeans should find the means to do so \"in coming weeks\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia Editor, MoscowReporters ask world leaders questions all the time.No big deal. Right?But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of \"the export of chaos\"?And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.\"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. \"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.Putin returns to my question.\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJaroslav LukivUS Air Force/ReutersThe US says its military has carried out a \"massive strike\" against the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria, in response to a deadly attack on American forces in the country.The US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.It said the operation \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.President Donald Trump said \"we are striking very strongly\" against IS strongholds, following the 13 December IS ambush in the city of Palmyra in which two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed.In a statement on X, Centcom, which directs American military operations in Europe, Africa and the Indo-Pacific, said Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched at 16:00 Eastern Time (21:00 GMT) on Friday.Centcom commander Admiral Brad Cooper said that the US \"will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists who seek to harm Americans and our partners across the region\".US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the operation \"is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance. \"If you target Americans - anywhere in the world - you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,\" the US defence secretary added.US Air Force/ReutersThe US Army identified the two soldiers killed in the attack as Sgt Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, and Sgt William Nathaniel Howard, 29Posting on Truth Social, President Trump said the US \"is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible\".He said the Syrian government was \"fully in support\".Meanwhile, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OBHR) said IS positions near the cities of Raqqa and Deir ez Zor were targeted.It said that a prominent IS leader and a number of fighters were killed.IS has not publicly commented. The BBC was unable to verify the targets immediately.Centcom earlier said that the deadly attack in Palmyra was carried out by an IS gunman, who was \"engaged and killed\".Another three US soldiers were injured in the ambush, with a Pentagon official saying that it happened \"in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"At the same time, the SOHR said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security forces.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.ReutersA US airman attaches a munitions system to an F-15 fighter jet taking part in Operation Hawkeye StrikeIn 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks.The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.Syria has recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.In November, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former jihadist leader whose coalition forces toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024 - met Trump at the White House, describing his visit as part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.",

    "body": "17 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondentandDoug FaulknerUN-backed experts say there have been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since the ceasefire, but 100,000 people still experienced \"catastrophic conditions\" last month. In August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) which monitors and classifies global hunger crises said that half a million people - about a quarter of Gaza's population - lived in areas suffering from famine.The UN and other humanitarian agencies have been able to increase food getting into Gaza since October's ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC report was \"deliberately distorted\" and \"doesn't reflect the reality in the Gaza Strip\".The latest IPC analysis suggests that a month ago, half a million Gazans were still facing emergency conditions and more than 100,000 were still under the highest level of food insecurity - IPC Phase 5 - experiencing \"catastrophic conditions\". It projects that number will continue to decrease but stressed the situation remains \"highly fragile\".  IPC Phase 5 signifies the most extreme level of food insecurity, labelled \"famine\" for an area or \"catastrophe\" when referring to households. The report said no areas in Gaza were now classified as \"in famine\".Israel rejected the original findings of famine by the IPC and has continued to criticise its methodology.  Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's crossings, said the number of trucks with food aid entering each week went beyond what the UN had determined it needed.\"The report relies on severe gaps in data collection and on sources that do not reflect the full scope of humanitarian assistance,\" the body said in a statement.Responding to the Cogat ctiticism, the IPC said publicly available data from UN sources and Cogat had been used for the analysis. The IPC said acute malnutrition was at critical levels in Gaza City and serious in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis.In the coming months the situation is expected to remain severe but the number of people facing the most severe conditions is predicted to fall to 1,900 by April, according to the report.But it added that, if there were renewed hostilities, the entire Strip would be at risk of famine.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that the second phase of the US-brokered peace plan - which would see Israel withdraw troops further from Gaza and Hamas disarm - was close but key issues still needed to be resolved.The IPC said key drivers of food insecurity included restricted humanitarian access, displacement of more than 730,000 people and the destruction of livelihoods - including more than 96% of crop land in Gaza being destroyed or inaccessible.Israel imposed a total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March this year, which was eased in May, saying it wanted to put pressure on the armed group Hamas to release hostages remaining in Gaza at the time.Ahead of this IPC report, Cogat said the body had not engaged with the US or Israel and its methodology, \"reinforcing a false narrative, driven in part by Hamas-sourced claims\".It also denied Israel was preventing winter and medical supplies from entering the territory and that there was a shortage of drinking water.Unwra, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said that while, the report stated Gaza was no longer in famine, the situation remained \"critical\".\"Overall living conditions in the Gaza Strip are still catastrophic, made worse by the winter weather,\" it said in a statement, adding there must be \"sustained, expanded, and consistent humanitarian and commercial access\".",

    "body": "1 day agoIlma HasanBBC Hindi, West BengalRubaiyat Biswas/BBCSunali Khatun says the deportation tore her family apart\"I was scared that my child's nationality would change if he was born in Bangladesh,\" says a heavily pregnant Sunali Khatun, 25, who returned to India earlier this month after being deported to the neighbouring country in June.Ms Khatun, a domestic worker from India's eastern state of West Bengal, was detained in Delhi with her husband, Danish Sheikh, and their eight-year-old son, and deported to Bangladesh on suspicion of being illegal immigrants. Bangladeshi authorities later jailed the family for entering the country unlawfully.Her deportation made national headlines and was stridently criticised by the West Bengal government, who accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led federal government of deporting her without cause. She is among hundreds of people who have been detained and deported to Bangladesh in the past couple of months on suspicion of being illegal immigrants.Delhi has not provided official data about these deportations, but top sources in the Bangladesh government had earlier told the BBC that in May alone, more than 1,200 people were \"illegally pushed in\". The same month, the government-run All India Radio reported that about 700 people had been sent back from Delhi.Crackdowns on alleged Bangladeshi immigrants are not new in India. The two countries share close cultural ties and a porous 4,096km (2,545-mile) border spanning five states. West Bengal, like others along the frontier, has long seen waves of migration as people sought work or fled religious persecution.But rights activists say the recent deportations target Muslims who speak Bengali - the language spoken in both West Bengal and Bangladesh - and the exercise is being conducted without due process.Rubaiyat Biswas/BBCMs Khatun and her son spent more than 100 days in a jail in BangladeshMs Khatun and her family, along with three neighbours - all Bengali-speaking Muslims - were deported after Delhi's Foreign Regional Registration Office said they lacked documents proving their legal entry or stay in India. Her seven-year-old daughter was left behind, as she was staying with relatives when the family was detained.Under protocol, authorities must verify a suspected illegal migrant's claim with the home state. West Bengal Migrant Workers Welfare Board chairman Samirul Islam told the BBC this was not done in Ms Khatun's case.The BBC has written to Delhi's home department that monitors deportations.In December, India's Supreme Court asked the federal government to allow Ms Khatun and her son to return on \"humanitarian grounds\" while her citizenship was investigated. She has since been living with her parents in West Bengal. Her husband, released on bail, remains in Bangladesh with a relative.Ms Khatun, says she has mixed feelings about being allowed back in India.She is relieved that her baby, due in January, will be an Indian citizen by birthright, but is anxious about her husband, whom she has not seen for more than three months since they were held in separate prison cells in Bangladesh.On video calls, she says, he breaks down often, saying that he wants to come home.\"We are not from Bangladesh, we are Indian. Why did they do this to us?\" Ms Khatun asks.Rubaiyat Biswas/BBCSunali's husband Danish remains in Bangladesh and speaks to her via video callsShe alleges that about a week after being detained by the Delhi police, her family and their neighbours were flown to the India-Bangladesh border and \"pushed\" across by paramilitary personnel from the Border Security Force (BSF).\"They left us in a dense forest [in Bangladesh] with lots of rivers and streams,\" she alleges and adds that when they tried to enter India by a route shown to them by locals, BSF guards beat up some in the group, including her husband, and then led them back into the forest they had initially been brought to.The BBC has sent questions to the BSF seeking a response to Ms Khatun's allegations.With help from locals, the group travelled to Dhaka, where they wandered for days with little food or water before being arrested and jailed. She says the prison food was inadequate for a pregnant woman and that her cell had no toilet.\"I was scared because it was just my son and me. All we did was cry,\" she says.The BBC has written to Bangladesh's home and prisons departments for a response to Sunali's allegations.Back in India, her family was making desperate trips to courts to prove her citizenship so that she could be brought back. Her case is being heard by the Supreme Court.\"My family has been torn apart,\" Ms Khatun says, as she sits in her parent's one-room shanty in West Bengal. With two young children and another one on the way, she says she doesn't know how she's going to feed all of them. But she is sure about one thing.\"We may not make enough money to eat three square meals if we live here, but I will never go back to Delhi,\" she says.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has suspended the US green card lottery scheme in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University last week in which two people were killed.The suspect, a Portuguese man who was found dead on Thursday, entered the country through the diversity lottery immigrant visa programme (DV1) in 2017 and was granted a green card.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she has paused the visa scheme under Trump's direction to \"ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous programme\".US officials said they believe the suspect, 48-year-old Claudio Neves Valente, also killed Portuguese Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro earlier this week.The programme makes up to 50,000 visas available each year through a random selection process among entries from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.Writing on social media, Noem said Trump had previously \"fought to end\" the scheme in 2017 after eight people were killed in a truck-ramming attack in New York City.Uzbekistan national Sayfullo Saipov, an Islamic State supporter who is serving multiple life sentences for the attack, entered the US through the DV1 scheme, according to Noem.Her comments come just hours after Valente was found dead in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, from what police believe is a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Police said video evidence and tips from the public led investigators to a car rental location where they found the suspect's name and matched him to their person of interest, following a six-day multi-state manhunt.He was found dead with a satchel and two firearms. Evidence in a car nearby matched to the scene of the shooting at Brown University in Providence, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha.Brown University President Christina Paxson said Valente was enrolled at the Ivy League school from the autumn of 2000 to the following spring, and was studying for a PhD in physics.He had \"no current active affiliation\" to Brown, she said.Officials said they believe Valente shot and killed MIT professor Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, on Monday at his home in Brookline, which is about 50 miles (80km) from Providence.Both men had studied at the same university in Portugal in the late 1990s, police said.Officials said the cases were linked when the suspect's vehicle was identified via CCTV footage and a witness at Brown University.The same car was spotted near the scene of the professor's shooting, which happened just two days later.Authorities have not provided any suspected motive for either of the attacks.Two students were killed and nine others were injured as a gunman burst into Brown University's engineering building on 13 December and opened fire during final exams.They have been identified as Ella Cook, 19, a second-year student from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, 18, an Uzbek-American who had just started at the university.",

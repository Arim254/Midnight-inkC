    "body": "2 days agoPaulin KolaEPA/ShutterstockJacques and Jessica Moretti, French owners of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, say they are co-operating with the investigationA judge in Switzerland has ordered that one of the two co-owners of the ski resort bar where 40 people died in a fire on New Year's Eve be kept in detention for 90 days.Swiss prosecutors have argued that Jacques Moretti, a French national, is a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.The blaze at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana also left 116 people injured. Many of the victims were aged under 20.The fire is believed to have been started by sparklers in champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations.Authorities acknowledged last week that the bar in the popular ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years.Watch: Co-owner of Swiss ski bar apologises to victimsJacques Moretti was first detained on Friday for an initial period of 48 hours. On Monday, a judge at what is known as a court of coercive measures ruled that he should be kept in custody for three months - a period that can be renewed under Swiss law.It is known as provisional - or preventive - detention and is meant to last until a case goes to court. In this instance, the court said the measure may be lifted upon payment of bail, whose sum would be set later.The couple were placed under criminal investigation days after the devastating fire. Moretti's wife, Jessica, who is under house arrest, told reporters on Friday that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".The prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar.EPA/ShutterstockPeople across Switzerland observed a minute's silence on FridayThe news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims.Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud said on Tuesday he could not explain why this had not been done for so long at that bar.\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns. Eighty remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other European countries.",

    "body": "1 day agoSakshi VenkatramanandBernd Debusmann Jr,White House ReporterVenezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado will meet President Donald Trump on Thursday,  the White House has confirmed.The visit comes just weeks after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was seized in Caracas by US forces. But Trump declined to endorse Machado, whose movement claimed victory in 2024's widely contested elections, as its new leader. The US instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.Machado said last week she hoped to thank Trump personally for the action against Maduro and would like to give the Nobel Prize to him. Trump called it  \"a great honour\", but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable.Earlier, Trump had expressed displeasure over Machado's decision to accept the  Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the president has long coveted.Asked on Friday whether receiving Machado's prize might change his view of her role in Venezuela, the president said: \"She might be involved in some aspect of it.\"\"I will have to speak to her. I think it's very nice that she wants to come in. And that's what I understand the reason is,\" he said.Earlier this month, after Maduro's ouster, Trump had said Machado \"doesn't have the support within, or the respect within, the country\". \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect,\" he said.The US has so far backed Delcy Rodríguez  as Venezuela's interim president.Trump describes Rodríguez as an \"ally\", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.\"Delcy Rodríguez and her team have been very cooperative with the United States,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. But Machado has maintained that her coalition should \"absolutely\" be in charge of the country.Machado has said nobody trusted Rodríguez, telling CBS that the interim leader was \"one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people\" in the South American country.\"Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,\" Machado said.The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela as \"a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela\".Rodríguez has rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela.\"The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does,\" she said in a televised speech. \"There is no external agent governing Venezuela.\"",

    "body": "17 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentA very cold start to 2025 and the growing power demands of data centres and cryptocurrencies saw US emissions of planet-warming gases rise for the first time in three years, a new analysis shows.Last year homes burned more gas for heating while the use of coal surged by 13% to meet rising electricity demands, the data finds.Although solar power also shot up last year, overall, greenhouse gas emissions went up by 2.4% after two years of decreases, outpacing the level of economic growth, according to estimates from the Rhodium Group.The authors say the policies of the Trump administration didn't \"meaningfully impact\" the rise in emissions but they expect this to change in the coming years.In the colder parts of the United States, most homes rely on natural gas and other fossil fuels for their heating.The low temperatures experienced in early 2025 saw consumption of these fuels increase by nearly 7% compared with the previous year.Extra electric power was also needed by the boom in data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations in places like Texas and the Ohio Valley region.The rising demand for power combined with the higher cost of gas was behind the 13% surge in US coal use last year. That was in marked contrast to both India and China, where coal use for electricity dropped 3% and 1.6% respectively as both countries added record amounts of wind and solar energy, according to an analysis for the website, Carbon Brief.\"The grid decided to meet that additional load this year, in part with renewables, in part with fossil but because of higher natural gas prices, there was some fuel switching that saw marginally more coal than there was in 2024,\" said Michael Gaffney, from Rhodium Group, the report's lead author. Other observers see the high price of gas in the US as closely related to continuing large exports of gas to the rest of the world.\"Higher natural gas prices means that finally, coal, which had been kind of driven to extinction by low natural gas prices, well [gas is] now so expensive that coal's worthwhile again,\" said Jesse Lee, from Climate Power, a US-based environmental campaign group. \"And that's what is allowing coal to make this comeback.\"Since 2007 coal power generation in the US has shrunk by 64%, with last year's rise only the second in the last decade.Last year also saw a slowdown in the rate of coal plant retirements, as electricity companies delayed closures to meet demands.So is 2025 the start of the revival of coal?\"It's more than just a blip,\" said Michael Gaffney.\"This is a response to the demand growth in the sector, a lot of it is coming from data centres, cryptocurrency operations, other large load customers, and that demand growth is here to stay.\"Solar power also experienced a major growth spurt in the US last year, rising by 34%, the fastest rate since 2017.Transport in the US, by road, rail and air remains the largest source of warming gases, with road traffic volumes increasing for the fifth year in a row.However, emissions from this sector were virtually flat in 2025 due to increasing numbers of hybrid and electric vehicles on the roads.Hybrids, in particular, showed strong growth, up 25% compared to 2024.While President Trump has been forceful in his determination to rollback the climate-related policies of his predecessor, and to boost US extraction of fossil fuel, Rhodium analysts who carried out this report say those changes made little difference in 2025.Some others disagree.\"There is a data centre explosion, that is somewhat independent of Trump,\" says Lee, of Climate Power. \"You could argue maybe his policies haven't all kicked in full blast yet, but I don't think you can really divorce his natural gas exports and his blind support of AI and data centres from this dynamic that's driving up emissions.\"Graphic by Mark Poynting",

    "body": "11 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandKoh EweProsecutors have asked for South Korea's former president Yoon Suk Yeol to be handed a death sentence if he is found guilty over his botched attempt to impose martial law.A court in Seoul heard closing arguments in Yoon's trial, in which he was accused of being the \"ringleader of an insurrection\". The charge stems from Yoon's attempt in December 2024 to impose military rule in South Korea - an act that lasted just hours but plunged the country into political turmoil. He was later impeached by parliament and detained to face trial.Yoon has denied the charges against him, arguing that martial law was a symbolic gesture to draw public attention to the wrongdoings of the opposition party.Leading an insurrection - the most serious charge against Yoon - carries sentences of the death penalty, or life imprisonment. Under South Korean law, prosecutors had to ask the judge for either one sentence or the other.South Korea has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years. In 1996, former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan was given the death penalty for seizing power in a military coup in 1979, though his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.The prosecutors in Yoon's case argue that although no one was killed in his martial law attempt, Yoon's intent was no less violent. Closing their arguments at Seoul Central District Court on Tuesday, prosecutors said the former president had been motivated by a \"lust for power aimed at dictatorship and long-term rule\".\"The greatest victims of the insurrection in this case are the people of this country,\" they told the court.\"There are no mitigating circumstances to be considered in sentencing, and instead a severe punishment must be imposed,\" they said.Prosecutors had called to the stand the military commander who testified that Yoon had ordered the arrest of lawmakers during his abortive coup. They also presented as evidence the memo made by one of the planners of the martial law, a former military officer, containing the suggestion of \"disposing\" of hundreds of people including journalists, labour activists and lawmakers.Yoon's insurrection trial has been merged with those of two other senior figures in his administration, former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun and former police chief Cho Ji-ho. Prosecutors sought life imprisonment for Kim, and 20 years in jail for Cho for carrying out Yoon's illegal orders. There are five other defendants.Yoon was in court to hear the final legal arguments. He has argued that as president, he had the power to declare martial law. Yoon was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying he had done so to fend off the \"wickedness that would ruin the nation\".Legal arguments were expected to end last Friday, but continued into Tuesday amid reports defence lawyers had delayed proceedings.The court is expected to deliver its verdict in February. Sentences sought by prosecutors are not always upheld in courts in South Korea.Yoon, 65, was removed from office in April, and is the country's first sitting president to be taken into custody. He has been detained for months while facing several criminal trials. Last month, prosecutors sought a 10-year prison term for Yoon for obstruction of justice and other charges related to his martial law attempt.On 3 December 2024, Yoon shocked the country - and the world - by declaring martial law over South Korea. He said at the time it was to protect the country from North Korean communist forces, but some saw it as a ploy by Yoon to get a grip on power amid domestic political woes.The short-lived martial law declaration sent South Korea into months of political turmoil, while Yoon became South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested and charged.South Korea's incumbent president, Lee Jae Myung, was elected in June following a snap election after Yoon's impeachment.Despite his downfall, Yoon retains loyal supporters in right-wing circles who see him as a martyr who dared to rail against the liberal Democratic Party led by Lee.",

    "body": "The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali immigrants, making it easier to deport thousands of people from the US.\"Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.TPS prevents US officials from deporting immigrants to countries deemed unsafe. Starting March 17, around 2,500 Somalis will lose their work authorisations and legal status, making them eligible for deportation.President Donald Trump has made it known he does not want Somali immigrants in the US, and has launched a major effort in Minneapolis to detain and deport people in the country illegally.\"Temporary means temporary,\" Noem said in a statement to the BBC. \"Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.\"Congress established TPS in 1990 to give refuge to people from countries that experienced war or environmental disasters. Immigrants with TPS authorisation are typically allowed to live and work legally in the US.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that there are 2,471 Somali nationals with TPS, and 1,383 people with pending applications. DHS responded to an online post about the announcement that the protective status was ending for those people with a Trump portrait carrying the caption: \"I am the captain now.\"Noem last month announced a surge of immigration officers in Minnesota, home to a large Somali diaspora community and where a sprawling federal fraud investigation found problems in the state's childcare industry, which the administration has linked to Somali immigrants.Jonathan Ross, an immigration enforcement agent, fatally shot US citizen Renee Good in her car last week during the Minneapolis operation sparking large protests locally and nationally. The Trump administration says the agent acted in self-defence but local officials insist the woman posed no danger.Trump has for months said he wants Somali immigrants to leave, saying they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\". Trump also said the US would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country\".Ahead of Tuesday's announcement, Trump also posted online saying \"FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!\"TPS for Somalia was first designated in 1991 by Republican President George H W Bush, following the outbreak of civil war in the country, and has been renewed since then by both Democratic and Republican presidents.The Biden administration had renewed TPS for Somalia for the maximum 18 months allowed under the law, which are set to end in March.Over the last year, the Trump administration has moved to end TPS for immigrants from other countries previously deemed unsafe, including Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Nepal.Those attempts have been challenged int he courts and in September a federal judge ruled that a move to end TPS for Haitians and Venezuelans was unlawful.",

    "body": "A Republican lawmaker is vowing to begin contempt-of-Congress proceedings against former President Bill Clinton after he failed to show up on Tuesday to testify before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein.House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer told reporters he would start proceedings against Clinton next week, and could do the same against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she fails to answer questions on Wednesday.The committee had issued subpoenas for both Clintons to testify about the late convicted sex offender.  Lawyers for the Clintons called the subpoenas \"unenforceable\", and said they had already provided the \"limited information\" they had about Epstein. Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and has denied knowledge of his sex offending. In a statement on Tuesday, Comer said the subpoenas to the Clintons were voted on in a \"bipartisan manner\". \"We communicated with President Clinton's legal team for months now, giving them opportunity after opportunity to come in, to give us a day, and they continue to delay, delay, delay, to the point where we had no idea whether they're going to show up today or not,\" he said. The Clintons contended the subpoenas - legal orders to provide testimony - \"are nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".     In a letter to Comer, lawyers for the Clintons said they had communicated \"proactively and voluntarily\" with the committee and that the subpoenas were \"untethered to a valid legislative purpose, unwarranted because they do not seek pertinent information, and an unprecedented infringement on the separation of powers\". Bill Clinton appears with Epstein and at the late financier's estate in photographs that were recently released by the US Department of Justice after Congress passed a law requiring the agency to release material related to investigations of Epstein.One picture shows the former president swimming in a pool, and another shows him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was arrested for sex-trafficking. Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said when the photos were released last month that they were decades old and Clinton stopped associating with Epstein before his crimes came to light.A spokesperson has previously acknowledged that Bill Clinton took four trips with staff on Epstein's private plane in 2002 and 2003, and met with Epstein in New York in 2002. Clinton also visited Epstein's New York apartment around that time.Citing flight logs, US media have previously reported Clinton flew on Epstein's jet more than two dozen times, occasionally without his Secret Service detail.Congress has the authority to detain someone until they comply with a subpoena, send a contempt certification to the justice department for prosecution or ask a court to force compliance.\"If the court finds that the party is legally obligated to comply, continued non-compliance may result in the party being held in contempt of court,\" according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\"Where the target of the subpoena is an executive branch official, civil enforcement may be the only practical means by which Congress can effectively ensure compliance with its own subpoena.\"Criminal contempt of Congress is a misdemeanour offence punishable by a fine up to  $100,000 (£74,500) and imprisonment up to a year.Over the last year, lawmakers from both parties have pushed to learn about Epstein's associations with powerful people and passed a law demanding that the justice department release all  files from federal investigations into the sex offender by the middle of December. After the department only released a portion of the files, the legislation's authors - Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna - went to court last week and asked a federal judge to appoint a special master to make sure the government complies with its requirements.",

However they continue to argue for other measures, with some experts raising similar concerns.\"We call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans,\" Meta said in a blog update.The company said it blocked 330,639 accounts on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads during it's first week of compliance with the new law.They again put the argument that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.\"This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law.\"Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.The policy is wildly popular with parents and envied by world leader, with the Tories this week pledging to follow suit if they win power at the next election, due before 2029.However some experts have raised concerns that Australian kids can circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.",

    "body": "2 days agoAdam EastonBBC News Warsaw correspondentReutersZbigniew Ziobro says he is a victim of political persecutionHungary has granted political asylum to Poland's former Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro who is facing charges of embezzlement.Ziobro is facing 26 charges related to embezzling money from a fund meant to be spent on crime victims and rehabilitating criminals.Instead, he is accused of authorising the purchase of spyware that was allegedly used to hack political opponents' phones. He says he is a victim of political persecution.Granting asylum to a citizen of a fellow EU member state goes against the spirit of EU standards.But in the case of Hungary it is neither new nor surprising.Ziobro is the second politician of the former Law and Justice-led government to be granted this status - last year it was his former deputy Marcin Romanowski who fled to Budapest to seek protection.Both are accused of corruption and misusing their power - most notably by using the money of the state-controlled Justice Fund which was under their oversight in order to fund their party and its cronies.Ziobro was justice minister between 2015 and 2023 under the previous right-wing PiS-led government, which is politically aligned to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.If found guilty he could face up to 25 years in prison.Writing on X, Ziobro said: \"I have decided to accept the asylum granted to me by the government of Hungary due to the political persecution in Poland.\"\"I have chosen to fight against political banditry and lawlessness. I stand in opposition to a creeping dictatorship,\" Ziobro added, accusing Prime Minister Donald Tusk of waging a \"vendetta\" against him.Ziobro is accused of authorising a 25m zloty ($7m; £5.15m) purchase of Israeli-made Pegasus spyware, which Poland's current coalition government and a European Parliament investigative team found was used to secretly hack the phones of political opponents.Current Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said his phone was hacked and Tusk said his wife's and daughter's phones were also hacked.Ziobro is also accused of awarding Justice Fund grants to fire stations and women's associations without proper competition to bolster support for the government.As minister of justice from 2015 to 2023, Ziobro was the author of judiciary reforms which provoked a major conflict with Brussels. The issue led to a freeze of EU money for Poland as well as to verdicts of the European Court of Justice, which deemed them as violating fundamental EU rules and standards including the principle of judicial independence. Orban, who faced similar criticism, and the PiS rejected and ignored those rulings, saying they violated Poland's sovereignty and constituted an overreach of Brussels's powers. ",

    "body": "Joshua Cavallo - the first man to come out as gay while playing top-tier football - has alleged he was pushed out of his former club due to \"internal homophobia\".Cavallo, who recently joined semi-professional English outfit Stamford AFC after leaving Adelaide United in May last year, made global headlines in 2021 when he came out with the support of his Australian club.In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Cavallo alleged that the Adelaide United officials had afterwards sidelined him due to his sexuality, something a spokesperson for the club said it \"categorically rejects\".\"All on-field decisions relating to team selection are made solely on footballing grounds,\" the club's statement read.In the Instagram post, Cavallo wrote that it had taken him a while to \"digest how my time at Adelaide United ended\" but said he was speaking out because fans deserve honesty.\"It's hard to swallow when I realised my own club was homophobic. I was angry because people thought I was sidelined based on injuries, when in reality, it was internal homophobia that kept me on the bench.\"A change in management meant \"politics\" kept him off the pitch and limited his career opportunities, Cavallo said, also alleging a photo of him and his partner was mocked by his teammates in a group chat.\"For the first time, I actually questioned if I should have kept my sexuality a secret.\"A spokesperson for Adelaide United - which is due to take part in its fourth Pride Cup match on Saturday - said it was \"extremely disappointed by the claims made\".\"Adelaide United has always been committed to fostering an inclusive environment for players, staff and supporters, and we remain proud of our ongoing work to promote inclusion across football.\"Cavallo has previously spoken about receiving death threats on a near daily basis after his decision to publicly come out, but has said that his only regret is not coming out sooner.While former professional footballers or those in lower tiers have come out as gay before, Cavallo was the first to do so while actively playing in a premier league.His 2021 revelation inspired Jake Daniels, who in 2022, at the age of 17, became the first British professional male footballer to come out in more than 30 years.",

    "body": "Ai, a female chimpanzee famous for her cognitive skills has died at 49, according to the Japanese institute where she lived. The Kyoto University's Center for the Evolutionary Origins of Human Behavior said Ai died on 9 January of old age and organ failure and that she was surrounded by staff when she died. Ai was born in western Africa and arrived at the Japanese institute in 1977. There, she became the namesake of the Ai Project, a research programme into the \"chimpanzee mind\".Among the institute's noteable findings were the fact that Ai was able to use numbers and identify colours. Researchers gave Ai a special keyboard linked to a computer when she was 18 months, a set-up that they used to study her memory and learning. At five years old, Ai \"mastered numerical naming from one to six and was able to name the number, colour and object of 300 types of samples\", according to a 1985 scientific paper by Tetsuro Matsuzawa, the primatologist behind the Ai Project.When she was not participating in cognitive tests, Ai was known to enjoy drawing and painting. Like other chimpanzees at the centre, Ai would scrawl marker pens over blank paper without having to be motivated by food rewards.Japanese media outlet Kyodo news reported that she once escaped with another primate - using a key to unlock her cage. In 2000 she gave birth to a son, Ayumu, who is also known for his remarkable memory.  In 2017 - the 40th anniversary of the Ai Project - a scarf made from one of Ai's paintings was gifted to renowned primatologist Dame Jane Goodall.",

    "body": "The death toll in a collapsed landfill in the central Philippines has risen to 11, authorities said. The landslide occurred at the Binaliw landfill in Cebu City last week while more than 100 workers were on site, officials said. Rescuers have so far pulled 12 injured people out of the debris, but more than 20 people still remain missing. One local fire official had earlier told AFP that was unlikely for \"people to still be alive\" three days after \"tons of debris collapsed over them\".But \"signs of life\" were detected in the debris during a search on Monday, Cebu City Mayor Nestor Archival told GMA News in an interview, adding that officials remain in \"rescue mode\".The incident has sparked calls for investigation into the cause of the collapse, as well as a review of the country's waste management system.Environment authorities have since ordered Prime Integrated Waste Solutions, Inc., the landfill's operator, to suspend its activities at the site.The company would have to \"submit a compliance plan within 90 days\", the local Department of Environment and Natural Resources said in a statement on Monday.The department also said it would conduct an investigation into the cause of the collapse and hold to account the responsible parties.Lawmakers have called for reviews of the country's waste management system and working conditions of waste workers.\"This should have never happened,\" Senator Imee Marcos, who has requested an investigation into the Binaliw landfill's operations, said on Monday. \"We have seen similar tragedies before, yet the same dangers persist.\"\"The lives lost in Cebu demand clear answers and real reforms.\"Bienvinido Ranido, who lives near the landfill and whose wife worked there, told Reuters that he saw people fleeing from the site last week, saying the \"garbage exploded\".\"I quickly took my motorcycle and rushed to the landfill. When I got there, I saw the collapsed building and it was buried by the garbage. I just screamed,\" he said. Rescuers retrieved his wife's body the next day.The Binaliw landfill is located on a piece of land measuring 20 hectares (49 acres) - three hectares of which are used for the landfill, Cebu newspaper The Freeman reported, citing the landfill's operator.While authorities are still looking into the cause of the landslide, a preliminary report from the local Mines and Geosciences Bureau points to continuous rainfall in recent weeks, which made the rubbish heavier, as well as other engineering factors, local media reported.Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has told a Paris court she hopes will overturn her conviction for embezzling EU funds that she had \"no sense of having committed an offence\".Le Pen, 57, was found guilty last year for hiring assistants who worked on her National Rally party's affairs rather than for the European Parliament (EP) that paid them.\"The EP did not play its role of raising the alarm as it should have,\" she told judges at the start of an appeal trial against a conviction banning her from running for public office for five years.If the ban is upheld, she will not be able to stand in the 2027 presidential election.The case at the Paris Court of Appeal will last until 12 February but a ruling is not expected before the summer.Last year's case centred on charges that Le Pen, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, used European Parliament funding to pay for National Rally staff in France.Le Pen was given a four-year prison sentence – with two years suspended and the remaining two to be served with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She was handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine and banned from seeking public office \"with immediate effect\".More than 20 RN figures were also found guilty in last year's trial and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended. Eleven of Le Pen's colleagues are taking part in the Paris appeal, but 12 have decided not to challenge the original verdicts, including her sister Yann Le Pen who was given a one-year suspended prison term.With Le Pen standing, presiding judge Michèle Agi started the hearing by reading the charges and last-year's verdict.The RN leader then returned to her seat, in the company of some of the other co-defendants and her lawyers. Judge Agi then read a report summarising facts of the case, after which Le Pen and her co-defendants took the floor.\"We have never concealed anything, neither in the publication of our organisational charts, nor in the contracts filed, nor in the numerous press articles,\" the RN leader said. Under the French legal system, an appeals court reviews the decision of the lower, first-instance court in its entirety - including facts as well as points of law.Le Pen will be hoping the Paris appeals court overturns last year's verdict and clears her name and path to run for the highest office in France for the fourth time.A second possible outcome would be for the appeals panel to affirm the guilty verdict but remove the \"immediate effect\" clause. This would enable her to run even if she decided to appeal to the country's highest court – the Court of Cassation – to overturn the guilty verdict.A third outcome could see the appeals judges curtail the five-year ban sufficiently to enable Le Pen to register by the March 2027 deadline.And a fourth would be to leave the lower court's decisions intact. This would make it next to impossible to run – even though she would still be expected to take the case to the Court of Cassation.The fifth - which would definitely rule Le Pen out of the race - would be for the original conviction to be upheld and the sentence to be stiffened. After all, the offence may be punishable with up to 10 years in jail.With the presidential election expected to be held around April 2027, much will depend on the substance – as well as the timing – of the judgements. The far-right leader has twice made it to the run-off stage and many of her supporters think she has a chance of winning if she is cleared to run next year.On Monday, the president of her National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, said barring her from the election would be \"deeply worrying for democracy\". Bardella said he would not stand for president but would instead seek the lower-ranking post of prime minister.   An opinion poll - published by Le Monde newspaper on the eve of the appeal - suggested Bardella may have a better chance of winning the French presidency - 49% against 18% for Le Pen.",

    "body": "16 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorOrganised crime prosecutors on the French island of Corsica are investigating the killing of former separatist leader Alain Orsoni, who was shot dead while attending his mother's funeral.Orsoni, 71, who had been living in exile for years in Nicaragua, was a well-known figure in Corsica. It is thought he was hit in the chest by a single bullet fired by a gunman lying in wait as the funeral ceremony in the village of Vero ended on Monday afternoon.\"It would appear he was hit by a long-range shot. He died pretty quickly from his injuries,\" said Corsican prosecutor Nicolas Septe.\"We'd just finished burying Alain's mother - it was a moment of pain and grief,\" said Father Roger-Dominique Polge who had led the funeral service.\"Suddenly we hear a gunshot and Alain falls down dead. In the middle of a cemetery, after a religious ceremony, I ask where are we, what kind of home are we living in? It's as if Corsica is worse than Sicily - it's unimaginable.\"No motive is yet known but Orsoni was for decades a high-profile figure in Corsican society and his graveyard murder in his native village shines a light on the criminal clans that have blighted the island.The investigation into his murder is being handled by a newly created national anti-organised crime prosecutor alongside the Marseille-based specialised regional crime office.A police source told Le Monde newspaper there were similarities with recent gangland killings targeting people linked to Orsoni's son, Guy.In 2023, two of Guy Orsoni's associates were shot dead, both by a gunman firing from some distance away. Guy Orsoni is himself serving a 13-year jail term for the attempted murder of a member of the so-called Petit Bar gang in 2018.Alain Orsoni led a storied life in Corsica and abroad. Renowned for his good looks and rich singing voice, he became attracted to Corsican nationalism in the 1970s and took part in a gun attack in front of the Iranian embassy in 1980. Three years later his brother was kidnapped and presumed murdered.\"Father, brother and son all found themselves thrust over time into the heart of politics and criminal cases,\" criminologist Alain Bauer told Ouest-France newspaper.Alain Orsoni later founded the separatist Movement for Self-Determination (MPA), which won four seats in elections in 1992. He was unable to take up his seat because of campaign irregularities and later spent time in jail for a series of offences.Amid violent splits among Corsican nationalist leaders, he left the island for Central America in 1996, eventually returning to become president of football club AC Ajaccio in 2008.Weeks after his return, police thwarted a plot to kill him by the Petit Bar gang.His role at AC Ajaccio ended in 2015 but he returned as club president in 2022, before returning to exile in Nicaragua and then resigning from his post in September last year.He was long aware of the risk to his life and, after the killing of four of his associates over a two-year period, he told Le Figaro newspaper in 2012 that he had bought an armoured car under pressure from his family after he was targeted in 2008.\"I'm not afraid of dying. I don't wake up every morning thinking I'm going to be killed. I live a normal life, without a squad of bodyguards,\" he said.\"I'm portrayed as a godfather, even though I don't even own a business on Corsica. As former head of a nationalist movement for 15 years I wasn't exactly a saint. But to depict me as a dangerous wheeler-dealer? That's a joke.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterScott Adams, the US cartoonist who wrote and illustrated the comic strip Dilbert, has died of cancer at the age of 68.His ex-wife Shelly Miles announced his death on Tuesday during a live stream of his podcast, Real Coffee with Scott Adams.The satirical cartoon strip - about a competent but frustrated engineer and his dysfunctional workplace environment - was first published in 1989, and went on to feature in more than 2,000 newspapers in 65 countries.The character also later appeared in books, an animated TV series and video game. But in 2023, his comic strip was cancelled by newspapers including the Washington Post after Adams was accused of making racist comments about black people.Adams called black Americans a \"hate group\" and suggested white Americans \"get the hell away from black people,\" in response to a conservative organisation's poll purporting to show that many African-Americans do not think it is OK to be white.He later defended his comments and said that he had been using hyperbole to make a point, adding that he disavowed racists and that media reports had ignored the context of his comments.US President Donald Trump paid tribute to Adams on Truth Social, following news of his death: \"Sadly, the Great Influencer, Scott Adams, has passed away. He was a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so. \"He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" Trump wrote.A tearful Shelly told listeners at the start of Adams's latest podcast on Tuesday: \"He's not with us anymore.\"She then read out a posthumous message from Adams: \"I had an amazing life, I gave it everything I had.\"If I got any benefits from my work, I'm asking that you pay it forward as best as you can. That's the legacy I want.\"Be useful, and please know I loved you all to the very end.\"In his later career, Adams - also a trained hypnotist - wrote self-help books including How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, Win Bigly, Loserthink and Reframe Your Brain.He had been receiving end-of-life care at his home after the prostate cancer, which he first revealed he had in May 2025, spread to his bones.On 1 January this year, he told listeners that the chances of him making a recovery were unlikely. \"I'll give you any updates if that changes, but it won't,\" he said.\"So there's no chance that I'll get my feeling back in my legs, and I've got some ongoing heart failure, which is making it difficult to breathe sometimes during the day.\"However, you should prepare yourself that January will probably be a month of transition, one way or another.\"",

    "body": "3 days agoGabriela PomeroyEPAOne person has died and 300 properties have been destroyed in bushfires that have torn across south-east Australia. The fires have raged in dozens of locations across the country for several days, mostly in the state of Victoria, but also in New South Wales, burning through land almost twice the size of Greater London.A state of emergency has been declared in Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battle the blaze. Residents in more than a dozen communities have been advised to leave their homes.Authorities fear the fires, which are being fuelled by very hot, dry and windy conditions, could burn for several weeks.AAP/Michael Currie via REUTERSA forest burns in Longwood, Victoria, Australia on 9 January Victoria's Premier Jacinta Allan said 30 active fires were burning across the state, 10 of which were of particular concern. She said 350,000 hectares had been burnt across the state as of 08:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday). \"We will see fires continue for some time across the state and that is why we are not through the worst of this by a long way,\" she told Australian media. \"There are fires that are continuing right now that are threatening homes and property.\"Human remains were found in the village of Gobur, near the town of Longwood, some 110km (70 sq miles) north of the state capital Melbourne, police said. The victim has not yet been identified.Allan praised the emergency workers who worked to retrieve the body. \"This is difficult and confronting work, and it takes a heavy toll.\"\"The Gobur community is grieving,\" she said. Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne. Authorities said the fires were the worst to hit the south-east of Australia since the 2019-2020 blazes that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people. Hundreds more are believed to have died due to the effects of the smoke which choked towns and cities that summer.ReutersFirefighter Tyrone Rice said losing his own home in the fire in Harcourt was \"a kick in the guts\"One of the worst-affected places is the small town of Harcourt in the central highlands of Victoria, where firefighter Tyrone Rice lost his own home in the blaze. He was out fighting one of the bushfires when he learned it was on fire. He told Australian media it was \"like a kick in the guts, but I'm not the first person to go through it, and I won't be the last\".The destruction in Harcourt was \"gut-wrenching\", local fire captain Andrew Wilson said. A reporter for Australia's 9 News, Jack Ward, told the BBC World Service he had visited the damage in several towns across eastern Australia. What he saw was \"catastrophic\", he said, and in many places, \"all that's left of these houses is a tin roof lying on the ground\".While it is hard to link individual wildfires to climate change as how humans manage the land can play a factor, scientists say climate change is making the hot, dry weather conditions conducive to bush fires more common.",

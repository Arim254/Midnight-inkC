    "body": "Rift at top of the Taliban: BBC reveals clash of wills behind internet shutdown2 hours agoBBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIt was a piece of audio obtained by the BBC that revealed what worries the Taliban's leader most.Not an external danger, but one from within Afghanistan, which the Taliban seized control of as the previous government collapsed and the US withdrew in 2021.He warned of \"insiders in the government\" pitted against each other in the Islamic Emirate the Taliban set up to govern the country.In the leaked clip, the supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada can be heard giving a speech saying that internal disagreements could eventually bring them all down.\"As a result of these divisions, the emirate will collapse and end,\" he warned.AFP / Universal Images Group via GettySupreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada (centre) has \"absolute power\", his spokesman said - but ministers including Sirajuddin Haqqani (left) and Mohammad Yaqoob (right) have questioned decisionsThe speech, made to Taliban members at a madrassa in the southern city of Kandahar in January 2025, was more fuel to the fire of rumours which had been circulating for months - rumours of differences at the very top of the Taliban.It is a split the Taliban leadership has always denied - including when asked directly by the BBC.But the rumours prompted the BBC's Afghan service to begin a year-long investigation into the highly secretive group - conducting more than 100 interviews with current and former members of the Taliban, as well as local sources, experts and former diplomats.Because of the sensitivity over reporting this story, the BBC has agreed not to identify them for their safety.Now, for the first time, we have been able to map two distinct groups at the very top of the Taliban - each presenting competing visions for Afghanistan.One entirely loyal to Akhundzada, who, from his base in Kandahar, is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate - isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.And a second, made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which - while still following a strict interpretation of Islam - engages with the outside, builds the country's economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school.One insider described it as \"the Kandahar house versus Kabul\".But the question was always whether the Kabul group, made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists, would ever challenge the increasingly authoritarian Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested.After all, according to the Taliban, Akhundzada is the group's absolute ruler - a man only accountable to Allah, and not someone to be challenged.Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.Listen: Audio obtained by the BBC of Taliban supreme leaderIn late September, Akhundzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world.Three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why.But what had happened behind the scenes was seismic, say insiders. The Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada's order and switched the internet back on.\"The Taliban, unlike every other Afghan party or faction, is remarkable for its coherence – there have been no splits, not even much dissent,\" explains an expert on Afghanistan, who has been studying the Taliban since they were established.\"Bound into the movement's DNA is the principle of obedience to one's superiors, and ultimately to the Amir [Akhundzada]. That's what made the act of turning the internet back on, against his explicit orders, so unexpected, and so notable,\" the expert said.As one Taliban insider put it: this was nothing short of a rebellion.A man of faithOnly two confirmed pictures of Akhundzada exist; this one, showing the supreme leader on the left, has been verified by BBC AfghanHibatullah Akhundzada did not begin his leadership like this.Indeed, sources say he was chosen as the Taliban's supreme leader in 2016 in part because of his approach of building consensus.Lacking battlefield experience himself, he found a deputy in Sirajuddin Haqqani - the feared militant commander, then one of the US's most wanted men with a $10m (£7.4m) bounty on his head.A second deputy was found in Yaqoob Mujahid, Taliban founder Mullah Omar's son – young, but bringing with him his Taliban bloodline, and its potential to unify the movement.The arrangement continued throughout negotiations with Washington in Doha to end the 20-year war between Taliban fighters and US-led forces. The eventual agreement, in 2020, resulted in the sudden and dramatic recapturing of the country by the Taliban, and the chaotic withdrawal of US troops in August 2021.Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesThe unexpected fall of Kabul in August 2021 saw thousands rush to the airport in the hope of being evacuated with US and other troops as they withdrewTo the outside world, they were a united front.But both deputies would find themselves quietly demoted to ministers as soon as the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, with Akhundzada now a lone power centre, insiders told the BBC.Even Abdul Ghani Baradar - the powerful and influential co-founder of the Taliban who had led negotiations with the US - found himself in the role of deputy prime minister instead of prime minister as many had expected.Instead, Akhundzada - having shunned the capital where the government sits in favour of remaining in Kandahar, a base of power for the Taliban - began surrounding himself with trusted ideologues and hardliners.Other loyalists were given control of the country's security forces, religious policies and parts of the economy.\"[Akhundzada], from the outset, sought to form his own strong faction,\" a former Taliban member - who later served in Afghanistan's US-backed government - told the BBC.\"Although he lacked the opportunity at first, once he gained power, he began doing so skilfully, expanding his circle using his authority and position.\"Akhundzada has filled his cabinet with loyalists in line with his vision, but those considered the \"Kabul group\" maintain their positions. Here, arguably the most influential members of each group are shownEdicts began to be announced without consultation with Kabul-based Taliban ministers, and with little regard for public promises made before they took power, on issues like allowing girls access to education. The ban on education, along with women working, remains one of the \"main sources of tension\" between the two groups, a letter from a UN monitoring body to the Security Council noted in December.Meanwhile, another insider told the BBC that Akhundzada, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban's Sharia courts of the 1990s, was becoming \"even more rigid\" in his religious beliefs.Akhundzada's ideology was already such that he not only knew but approved of his son's choice to become a suicide bomber, according to two Taliban officials after his death in 2017.And he is convinced that making the wrong decision could have implications beyond his lifetime, the BBC has been told.\"Every decision he makes he says: I'm accountable to Allah, on judgement day, I will be questioned why I didn't take an action,\" one current Taliban government official explained.Two people who have been in meetings with Akhundzada described to the BBC how they were faced with a man who barely spoke, choosing to communicate mainly through gestures, interpreted through a team of elderly clerics in the room.In more public settings, other eyewitnesses said he obscures his face - covering his eyes with a scarf draped over his turban, and often standing at an angle when addressing an audience. Photographing or filming Akhundzada is forbidden. Only two photos of him are known to exist.Getting a meeting has also become increasingly difficult. Another Taliban member told the BBC how Akhundzada used to hold \"regular consultations\", but now \"most Taliban ministers wait for days or weeks\". Another source told the BBC the Kabul-based ministers have been told to \"travel to Kandahar only if they receive an official invitation\".At the same time, Akhundzada was moving key departments to Kandahar - including distribution of weapons, which had previously come under the control of his former deputies Haqqani and Yaqoob.In its December letter, the UN monitoring team noted Akhundzada's \"consolidation of power has also involved a continued build-up of security forces under the direct control of Kandahar\".Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units - bypassing ministers in Kabul.One analyst argues the result is that \"real authority has been transferred to Kandahar\" - something Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied to the BBC.\"All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions - all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties,\" he said.However, \"from a Sharia perspective, he [Akhundzada] has the absolute power\", Mujahid added - saying \"to avoid God-forbidden division, his decisions are final\".Men 'who have seen the world'APKabul (pictured) is the capital, and the seat of government for AfghanistanAmong the Kabul group, unhappiness was growing and alliances were strengthening.\"They [the Kabul group] are people who have seen the world,\" one analyst told the BBC. \"Therefore, they believe that their government, in its current form, cannot last.\"The Kabul group want to see an Afghanistan which moves towards the model of a Gulf state.They are concerned about the concentration of power in Kandahar, the nature and enforcement of virtue laws, how the Taliban should engage with the international community and women's education and employment.But despite advocating for Afghan women to have more rights, the Kabul group is not described as moderate.Instead, insiders see them as \"pragmatic\", unofficially led by Baradar - the Taliban founding member who still commands great loyalty. He is also thought to be the \"Abdul\" referred to by Donald Trump as the \"head of the Taliban\" during a 2024 US presidential election campaign debate. In fact, he was the group's chief negotiator with the US.The Kabul group's shifting positions have not gone unnoticed.\"We remember that they [the Taliban leaders based in Kabul] used to destroy television sets, but now they appear on TV themselves,\" one analyst said.They also understand the power of social media.Former deputy Yaqoob - whose father led the Taliban during its first rule, when music and television were banned - finds himself increasingly popular with young Taliban members and some ordinary Afghans, evident in gushing TikTok videos and merchandise adorned with his face.But no one has been more effective in rebranding themselves than his fellow former deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani. His ability to evade capture as his network orchestrated some of the most lethal and sophisticated attacks in the Afghan war against US-led forces - including a 2017 truck bombing in Kabul which killed more than 90 civilians near the German embassy - elevated him to near-mythical status among supporters.During this time, only one known photograph of him existed - taken by a BBC Afghan journalist.FBIThe bounty on Sirajuddin Haqqani - pictured in his wanted FBI poster, before the Taliban returned to power - was dropped last yearBut then, six months after the US withdrawal, Haqqani marched out in front of the world's cameras at a graduation ceremony of police officers in Kabul, his face uncovered.It was the first step towards a new image: no longer a militant, but a statesman - one with whom the New York Times would sit down in 2024 and ask: is he Afghanistan's best hope for change?Just a few months later, the FBI would quietly drop the $10m bounty on his head.Yet analysts and insiders repeatedly told the BBC that openly moving against supreme leader Akhundzada was unlikely.Arguably the most visible opposition to his edicts had been minor and limited - for example not enforcing regulations like the ban on shaving beards in regions controlled by Kabul group-aligned officials. But larger acts of rebellion have always been considered unthinkable.One former Taliban member emphasised to the BBC that \"obedience to [Akhundzada] is considered mandatory\".Haqqani himself, in his interview with the New York Times, played down any chance of an open split. \"Unity is important for Afghanistan currently so we can have a peaceful country,\" he said.Instead, one analyst said, the Kabul group is choosing to send \"a message to both the international community and Afghans\", one which says: \"We are aware of your complaints and concerns, but what can we do?\"At least, that was the case before the order came to shut down the internet.A breaking pointAFP via Getty ImagesThe internet switch-off began in carefully selected provinces and then expanded to the whole country in late SeptemberThe Taliban's supreme leader is a man with a deep distrust of the internet; he believes its content to be against Islamic teachings, and is so dedicated to his belief that an aide reads out the latest news or social media posts to him each morning instead, his spokesman once explained to the BBC.The Kabul group believe that a modern country cannot survive without it.The supreme leader's internet shutdown order began in provinces controlled by Akhundzada's allies, before it was expanded to the whole country.Sources close to the Kabul group and within the Taliban government described what happened next - an almost unprecedented moment in the Taliban's history.\"It surprised many members of the movement,\" one source said.In short, the Kabul group's most powerful ministers came together and convinced  Kabul-based Prime Minister Mullah Hassan Akhund to order it switched back on.In fact, the group had already made its unhappiness with the edict known before the internet was cut across the country: the group's de-facto leader, Baradar,  travelled to Kandahar to warn one of Akhundzada's most loyal governors that they needed to \"wake him up\" - adding they had to stop being the supreme leader's \"yes\" men.\"You don't tell him the truth openly; whatever he says, you just implement,\" he was reported as saying by a Kandahar insider.His words, the source said, were dismissed. On Monday, 29 September, an order came into the telecommunications ministry directly from the supreme leader to shut everything down. \"No excuses\" would be accepted, a source in the ministry told the BBC.On Wednesday morning, a group of Kabul group ministers - including Baradar, Haqqani and Yaqoob - gathered at the prime minister's office, joined by the telecommunications minister. Here, they urged the Kandahar-aligned prime minister to take charge and reverse the order. According to one source, they told him the full responsibility lay with them.It worked. The internet returned.But perhaps more importantly, within those few days, it was as if what Akhundzada had hinted at in that speech months earlier had come to pass: insiders were threatening Taliban unity.AFP via Getty ImagesThe decision to reverse the order took many by surprise - including Kabul group supportersBut why this order? One expert points out Taliban members have been happy to follow Akhundzada despite disagreeing with edicts like the ones on girls' education.Meanwhile, many of those who had challenged him openly before had paid a price.In February 2025, the then-deputy foreign minister had to flee the country after warning publicly the leadership was straying from \"the path of God\" in \"committing injustice against 20 million people\" - a reference to the female education ban.UN monitors point to at least two others who have been arrested after questioning Akhundzada's decrees on girls' education, in July and September 2025.But there is also evidence of Akhundzada and his allies moving to keep figures like Haqqani close - despite the latter's public criticisms of the supreme leader's consolidation of power.Even so, tipping over from words into actions and so decisively disregarding an order was arguably another step all together.As one expert points out, this time it may have been worth the risk.Their positions come with power and an \"ability to make money\", the expert says. But both depended on the internet, now crucial to both governing and commerce.\"Turning off the internet threatened their privileges in a way that keeping older girls out of education never did,\" the expert points out.\"Maybe that's why they were 'brave' that one time.\"APBeyond primary school, girls and women are denied an education under the TalibanAfter the internet was turned back on, speculation was rife about what would happen next.A source close to the Kabul group suggested the ministers will be slowly removed or demoted.However, the Kandahar insider suggested it might be the supreme leader who backed down \"because he fears such opposition\".As the year drew to an end, it appeared publicly that nothing had changed.The letter to the UN Security Council noted some UN member states \"have downplayed the division between leaders in Kandahar and Kabul as akin to a family dispute that would not alter the status quo; all senior leaders are invested in the success of the Taliban enterprise\".Zabiullah Mujahid, the senior Taliban government spokesman, has categorically denied any split.\"We will never allow ourselves to be divided,\" he told the BBC in early January 2026. \"All officials and leadership know that a split can be harmful for all, for Afghanistan, religiously prohibited and forbidden by Allah.\"However, he did also acknowledge that differences in \"opinion\" exist among Taliban members, but equated it to \"a difference of opinion in a family\".Half way through December, those \"differences\" had appeared to surface once more.Haqqani was filmed addressing a crowd in his home province of Khost during Friday prayers, warning that anyone who \"gets to power through the nation's trust, love and faith and then abandons or forgets the same nation... is not a government\".The same day, Akhundzada loyalist Neda Mohammad Nadem - the higher education minister - made his own speech to graduating students at a madrassa in a neighbouring province.\"Only one person leads and the rest follow orders, this is a true Islamic government,\" he said. \"If there are too many leaders then problems will emerge and this government that we have achieved will be ruined.\"After the dispute over the internet, these recent comments are set against a very different backdrop to those made by Akhundzada in the leaked audio at the start of 2025.Yet whether 2026 will be the year that the Kabul group move to make meaningful change for the women and men of Afghanistan is very much still up for debate.\"As ever… the question remains after apparent disagreement within the Emirate's top tier – will words ever lead to action?\" says one expert.\"They haven't yet.\"Edited and produced by Zia Shahreyar, Flora Drury and the BBC Afghan Forensics team.

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA labour rights organisation claims it has found evidence of worker exploitation in a Chinese factory that makes the viral Labubu dolls.China Labor Watch (CLW), a US-based non-governmental organisation, alleges that its investigation found that one of Pop Mart's suppliers made employees work excessive overtime shifts, sign blank or incomplete contracts and did not give them paid leave.The furry Labubu dolls have surged in popularity around the world in recent years and are best known for selling toys in \"blind boxes\", which hide its content from buyers until it is opened.Pop Mart told the BBC that it is investigating the claims.The Beijing-based toy retailer said it appreciated the details from the review and that it will \"firmly\" require companies making its toys to correct their practices if the allegations are found to be true.Pop Mart added that it conducts regular audits of its suppliers, including yearly independent third-party reviews carried out by internationally recognised inspectors.CLW said in its report that it had carried out the in-depth probe into Labubu-maker, Shunjia Toys Co Ltd, in the southern Chinese province Guangdong.The BBC has been unable to contact Shunjia Toys Co Ltd for comment.CLW said its researchers conducted 51 in-person interviews with the factory's employees to discuss matters of recruitment, contracts and their working conditions. The factory is a \"core manufacturing facility\" of Pop Mart toys and employed more than 4,500 workers, according to CLW.The organisation flagged labour issues at Shunjia Toys Co Ltd's factory in Xinfeng County, including what it said were illegal overtime hours, unclear contract practices and a lack of safety training and protections.No child labour was identified at the factory, but it had employed 16-year-old workers who were subject to the same working conditions as adults, without special care that is required under Chinese law, said CLW.It urged Pop Mart to take \"immediate action\" to address the issues in its supply chain. The non-profit said the firm should compensate affected workers and ensure that its production line complies with Chinese labour laws and internationally recognised labour standards.Such facilities, called original equipment manufacturers (OEM), make products according to pricing and production schedules set by the client.\"As a result, labour conditions in OEM facilities are closely shaped by brand sourcing practices,\" said CLW.Labubus - the fictional elf-like creatures with a row of jagged teeth have become hugely popular. The craze has sparked long queues in shops worldwide.Celebrity endorsements from the likes of Kim Kardashian and Lisa from K-pop group Blackpink have helped Pop Mart to become a major toy retailer.",

    "body": "You must have heard of Dubai chocolate: the sticky, indulgent confectionary filled with pistachio cream, tahini and shreds of knafeh pastry, which has become a global sensation.Now the decadent bar has inspired South Korea's latest dessert craze. The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. \"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. \"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily.

    "body": "Zelensky declares energy emergency as biting cold persists4 hours agoTabby WilsonWatch: Inside Kyiv's 'invincibility train' for residents left without powerUkraine has declared a state of emergency in the country's energy sector, with a particular focus on Kyiv, as ongoing Russian strikes continue to leave thousands of residents without power. President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of deliberately exploiting the harsh winter conditions as part of its war strategy, with overnight temperatures in Kyiv recently dropping to around -20C.The declaration comes as Zelensky's US counterpart Donald Trump said he was holding up efforts to secure a peace deal to end nearly four years of war with Russia.He told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Ukraine \"is less ready to make a deal\" than Russian president Vladimir Putin. When asked why peace talks have not yet resolved the conflict, Trump responded: \"Zelensky\".The two leaders are both expected to attend the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week, although Trump suggested no formal plans were arranged for them to meet. In recent weeks, Russian attacks on Kyiv have left thousands of homes without regular power, heating or running water. After one particularly heavy night of missile and drone attacks last week, 70% of the capital was left without power for several hours.Following a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Zelensky said a round-the-clock task force would be set up to fix damage caused by Russian strikes and worsening weather conditions. He said the new measures would include procuring vital energy equipment and resources from abroad to replace damaged installations. \"The First Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Energy of Ukraine has been assigned to oversee work supporting people and communities under these conditions,\" he wrote on X.He also ordered an increase in the number of emergency help points around Kyiv to provide heat and power for residents, a move which could see a relaxing of current midnight curfew in the capital.ReutersA government-run humanitarian aid point in KyivRussian attacks on energy infrastructure have not been limited to the capital.Last week, Ukrainian officials said that more than one million people in south-eastern Ukraine spent hours without heating and water supplies as a result of Russian air strikes. DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its CEO, Maxim Timchenko, told the BBC last month.As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and the company had found it difficult to cope.He added that the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".DTEK currently provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians.",

    "body": "50 minutes agoHarry SekulichReutersProtester shielding themself from tear gas in MinneapolisAn Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer has shot a man in the leg in the US city of Minneapolis, where an ICE agent shot dead a woman last week.In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said federal officers initially pursued the man in a car chase because he was illegally in the US from Venezuela.The City of Minneapolis confirmed a man was shot and taken to hospital for non-life threatening injuries. An ICE officer was also taken to hospital to be treated for injuries, the DHS said.Tensions over immigration enforcement have been running high in the city since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent on 7 January.Good's death has sparked protests in Minneapolis, which have also spread to multiple other US cities.The latest shooting prompted renewed clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, the city's police chief Brian O'Hara said, adding his officers were hit by fireworks, ice and snowballs.Minneapolis city officials said on X: \"We understand there is anger. We ask the public to remain calm.\"\"The City of Minneapolis again demands that ICE leave the city and state immediately,\" they added.In response to Wednesday's incident, a DHS statement said the man got out of his car and an altercation took place between him and an ICE official. It added that during the incident two other people emerged from a nearby apartment building and allegedly \"attacked\" the officer.\"Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots,\" the DHS statement said, adding \"both attackers are in custody\".The BBC could not immediately independently verify details in the statements.  O'Hara said the FBI is investigating the incident.In response to the latest ICE shooting, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey accused federal officers of \"creating chaos\" across the state.Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota over recent weeks.Watch: Protesters clash with authorities in Minneapolis after ICE shoot man in legOfficials have offered differing accounts of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, with the Trump administration claiming the ICE agent was acting in self defence, while local officials say the woman posed no danger.Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is in the middle of the street. As it attempts to drive off, one of them at the front of the vehicle points his gun at the driver and fired three shots. The FBI is investigating the incident. Minneapolis city leaders have said Good was at the scene as a legal observer of ICE activities - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations.Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"not part of anything\" that involved challenging ICE agents.But White House officials, including President Donald Trump, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work.A fundraiser set up for Good's widow and family has raised more than $1.4m.In a statement on X responding to reports of ICE shooting the man in the leg, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said: \"Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting.\"Shortly before news of the latest shooting emerged, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz urging Trump to end the \"occupation\" of ICE officers in the state in a video on social media.\"Angry is not a strong enough word,\" Walz said during his address.",

    "body": "'It was terrifying': Residents describe carnage after Thai train crash2 hours agoPanisa AemochaBBC Thai, Sikhio, Nakhon RatchasimaWatch: BBC reports from site where crane collapsed on train in ThailandResidents in Thailand's Ban Thanon Khot are accustomed to the rumbling of trains – rail is a key mode of transportation connecting the remote town with major cities.But on Wednesday, the mundane rhythm ended in tragedy. \"The noise was abnormally loud. A huge, crashing sound,\" said school volunteer Pitchaya Promenade. \"I saw a blue crane sliding. It seemed stuck for a moment, and suddenly it flipped over.\" The construction crane had collapsed onto a moving train, killing at least 32 people and injuring 66 others. Most were students and workers travelling for school and work. Thailand's Public Health Ministry said there were still three people missing from the accident.Rescuers were still pulling bodies out of the mangled train when the BBC arrived at the scene in the evening. Parts of it were completely crushed. \"If I had to describe the damage visually, it looked like a spoon scooping into a slice of cake,\" said Pitchaya, 32, who is trained in basic first aid and was able to attend to some of those wounded.\"There was an elderly woman hanging upside down [from a carriage]... Another woman, whose right arm appeared to be broken, was holding onto her.\"One of the train carriages had caught fire from the collision, which further complicated rescue efforts. Emergency responders used cranes and hydraulic cutting tools to free passengers trapped in the wreckage. \"People were screaming 'Help! Help!' and smoke was starting to rise,\" said restaurant owner Penporn Pumjantuek, who works about 100m (328 ft) from the scene. \"Oil from the train was spilling everywhere.\"EPAA construction crane had collapsed onto a moving train, killing at least 32 peopleShe recalls being \"torn between fear and courage\". \"I'm still scared when I think about it<\" she told BBC Thai. \"I still remember that moment, running in to help them, when there was no one else there yet. They were crying. It was terrifying.\"A one-year-old and an 85-year-old were among those injured, with seven people in critical condition, authorities said on Wednesday.Suphann Imchantrik, a local resident, was among those who helped the one-year-old. \"The child was still breathing, but barely,\" the 52-year-old said.\"I saw those dead too… lying there. There were injured people. Everything was right there. It was a heartbreaking sight.\"The crane involved in the accident was being used to build an overhead railway that is part of a US$5.4bn (£4bn) China-backed project to link Bangkok with southwestern China via Laos.Many questions remain unanswered. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has called for an investigation, while the State Railway of Thailand has said it is suing the Italian-Thai Development Company - the firm in charge of the section of the railway where the incident took place. \"I'm still scared when I think about it... It was terrifying,\" said Penporn PumjantuekThis is the same company responsible for the construction of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed last March during an earthquake, when no other buildings in the city fell.Amorn Pimanmas, an engineering professor at Bangkok's Kasetsart University, believes that human, rather than natural, factors are the more likely cause of Wednesday's tragedy. Given that there were no storms, no flooding, and no significant vibration from the train passing underneath, \"natural causes can almost entirely be ruled out as the origin of the incident\", Amorn said.Thailand is no stranger to deadly construction accidents, due in part to weak enforcement of safety standards and regulations.In 2023, a freight train collided with a pick-up truck that was crossing railway tracks in the country's east, killing eight people and injuring four others.Meanwhile, over the past seven years, around 150 people have been killed in numerous accidents on a road improvement project from Bangkok to the south of the country.Additional reporting by Kelly Ng in SingaporeThe crane was used to build an overhead railway that is part of a China-backed project",

    "body": "US launches phase two of Gaza peace plan with new technocratic government12 hours agoDavid GrittenandJon Donnison,JerusalemReutersPhase two of the peace plan should see reconstruction starting in Gaza after two years of warUS envoy Steve Witkoff has announced the start of phase two of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, with a technocratic Palestinian government established in the territory.Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Witkoff said phase two would also see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.\"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations,\" he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"However, two key points of phase two could be problematic.Hamas has previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and Israel has not committed to fully withdrawing from Gaza.The ceasefire is also fragile at best, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations. Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.And humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies.In his statement, Witkoff declared that with the launch of phase two of Trump's 20-point peace plan on Wednesday, Gaza was \"moving from ceasefire to demilitarisation, technocratic governance, and reconstruction\".\"Phase Two establishes a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), and begins the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel,\" he said.Following the announcement, regional mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey welcomed the formation of what they called the \"Palestinian Technocratic Committee to Administer the Gaza Strip\", saying it would contribute to \"efforts aimed at consolidating stability and improving the humanitarian situation\".They also revealed that the 15-member committee would be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy planning minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.Gaza's transitional administration will operate under the supervision of a \"Board of Peace\", which will be chaired by Trump, according to the 20-point plan he unveiled three months ago.Announcements related to the board are expected in the coming days, including when the president visits the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, is set to be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza.Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces.Israel's prime minister told Ran Gvili's parents that his return was \"a top priority\"Earlier on Wednesday, Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said in a joint statement that they had agreed to support the efforts to form the technocratic Palestinian government \"while providing the appropriate environment\" for it to begin work.The PA - which is dominated by Fatah, Hamas's rival - also expressed support.Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh said Trump's leadership urged all Palestinian factions, institutions and segments of society to \"ensure the success of this critical transitional phase\". He also stressed the importance of linking institutions in the West Bank and Gaza in order to uphold \"the principle of one system, one law, and one legitimate weapon\".According to Trump's plan, the PA will take over governing Gaza once it has completed reforms and can do so \"securely and effectively\".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had spoken on Wednesday evening with the parents of Ran Gvili, the last dead hostage in Gaza.He made it clear to Itzik and Talik Gvili that \"Ran's return is a top priority and that the declaratory move regarding the establishment of a technocratic committee will not affect the efforts to return Ran for a Jewish burial\", the office added.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum insisted: \"There is no phase 2 while Ran Gvili in Gaza. Phase Rani must come first.\"The Israeli government had accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the 24-year-old police officer's remains and said it will not reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt – one of its obligations under phase one - until they are handed over.Gvili was among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,430 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

Maryam had been fatally shot - and they had no idea where the bullet had come from.Reza carried Maryam's body for an hour and a half. Exhausted, he sat down in an alley. After a short time, the door of a nearby house opened. The people who lived there took them into their garage, brought a white sheet and wrapped Maryam's body in it.Days before Maryam headed out to the protests, she had told her children - aged seven and 14 – about what was happening in their country. \"Sometimes parents go to the protests and don't come back,\" she said. \"My blood, and yours, is no more precious than anyone else's.\"Reza and Maryam's names have been changed for safety reasons.Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting via WANA via ReutersIranian state television has shown this burnt-out bus, saying it was filmed in Tehran on 10 JanuaryMaryam is one of thousands of protesters who should have returned home but never did, as the authorities responded to the rapid spread of demonstrations across Iran with a deadly crackdown.The US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has been able to confirm the killing of at least 2,400 protesters, including 12 children, during the past three weeks.It is extremely difficult to determine the death toll, which is expected to rise in the coming days, because the country remains under a near-total internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities on Thursday night.  Human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is unable to report on the ground.Iranian authorities have not provided a death toll but local media have reported 100 security personnel have been killed, and protesters - whom they have portrayed as \"rioters and terrorists\" - have set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.User generated contentKashani, Tehran, on 8 JanuaryDemonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers.Security forces soon launched a violent crackdown, with at least 34 protesters reported killed by 7 January, the 11th day of the unrest. However, it appears the bloodiest crackdown was last Thursday and Friday, when thousands of people took to the streets across the country and called for an end to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.BBC Persian has received dozens of accounts from inside Iran. Defiant despite potential repercussions, the witnesses said they wanted to ensure the rest of the world knew of the violence against the protesters.User generated contentA demonstration outside Hoze Elmiye religious institution, in Najaf Abad, on 8 January\"Our neighbourhood smells of blood - they killed so many,\" one told BBC Persian. Another recalled security forces \"mostly shooting at heads and faces\".The protests have spread across all 31 provinces. And the information trickling in clearly shows the scale of the killings in smaller cities and towns is just as severe as in major cities.In Tonekabon, a town of 50,000 people in the north, Sorena Golgun was killed on Friday. The 18-year-old university student was \"shot in the heart\" running from an ambush by security forces, according to a family member.Family of Sorena GolgunSorena Golgun's family say the 18-year-old university student was shot in his heart running from security forces in TonekabonLike Sorena, many of the other protesters killed were young and full of dreams. Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday.Her mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina's body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present.Not all those killed were protesters. Navid Salehi, a 24-year-old nurse in Kermanshah, was shot multiple times leaving work on Thursday.The bodies of many protesters were sent to the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, in Tehran. The scenes there were so distressing Sahanand, who did not want to give his real name, decided to travel almost 1,000km to a border area so he could send out video footage by using the mobile data networks of neighbouring countries. On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said. Again, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.User generated contentKashani, Tehran, on 8 JanuaryOne young woman, speaking to BBC Persian on condition of anonymity, described last week's events as like \"a war\". The protesters remained \"more united than ever before\" but it was too much for her and this week she had fled the country - like many, gripped by fear the authorities will start a new wave of executions and prosecutions.\"I'm really afraid of what might happen to those who are still in Iran,\" she added.Additional reporting by Farzad Seifikaran and Hasan Solhjou",

    "body": "7 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterA British owned, Canadian-made whisky is at the centre of a spat between two provinces that is testing a unified \"Team Canada\" approach in the face of US tariffs.It started after the whisky maker, Diageo, said it will shut down a bottling plant in Ontario to move some of it closer to US consumers. Soon after, Ontario Premier Doug Ford angrily poured out a bottle of Crown Royal in front of reporters, and now says the product will be removed from provincial liquor stores. This has alarmed neighbouring Manitoba, where a Crown Royal distillery is a key employer in the small town of Gimli.In a symbolic visit to the Gimli distillery on Tuesday, Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew urged Ford to \"do a 180\".Ford has not signalled he will reverse course, but in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Kinew said he remains \"optimistic\". \"I know he's definitely talked himself into a position, but at the same time, it's not too late to do the right thing,\" Kinew said. The row over Crown Royal – a Canadian whisky brand that was introduced during the 1939 royal tour of Canada by King George VI – dates back to August. That's when Diageo first announced it would close its Amherstburg, Ontario, bottling facility after five decades of operations.The UK-based company said last summer it planned to close the plant in February as part of a broader restructuring to improve its North American supply chain, and – to Ford's dismay – move bottling operations closer to the US.\"Here's what I think about Crown Royal,\" he said shortly after Diageo's announcement, before pouring an entire bottle of the whisky on the ground during a news conference and calling Diageo owners \"dumb as a bag of hammers\".He then vowed to \"hurt\" the firm and urged Canadians to boycott the product.The company has said bottling operations for Canada and non-US markets are set to move to a Quebec facility southwest of Montreal. While it has not said it will shift any operations to the US, Ford has speculated that they will. \"It's all going to Alabama,\" he said earlier this month. \"Mark my words.\"Ford also vowed to remove the whisky from the shelves in Ontario, where liquor stores are operated by the province. The Liquor Board of Ontario is the largest wholesale purchaser of alcohol in North America. Crown Royal is its top selling whisky, according to Diageo. Manitoba is now pleading with Ford to change his mind.The Crown Royal distillery plant is a major driver for business in the town of Gimli, home to about 2,300 people, Premier Kinew said. He warned Ford that he could inadvertently hurt Canadians with the boycott. Diageo employs more than 500 people across Canada, the company told the BBC, including 100 in Ontario separate from those working at the Amherstburg site.\"Let's not take action that would harm other Canadian workers, and let's focus on being united,\" Kinew said, noting that Canada \"has no shortage of economic challenges\" with the tariffs it is facing from the US and China. Nicknamed \"Captain Canada\" by some, Ford has built a reputation for being combative against US tariffs and the job losses they have been linked to in Ontario.Ford notably led a charge to remove US liquor from Canadian stores in retaliation for the levies - a move that has since become a trade irritant for the Trump administration.He has often appeared on major US networks to make the case for free trade between the two countries.More recently, an anti-tariff advertisement commissioned by the province that ran on American TV caused Trump to abruptly halt trade talks with Canada.Still, Ford's reaction to Diageo has been applauded by the local union, which says it represents more than 200 workers at the Amherstburg plant whose future is now uncertain.\"This is how you fight a trade war,\" Unifor National President Lana Payne said in September, after Ford first called for a boycott.But the United Food & Commercial Workers, the union representing Diageo workers outside Ontario, criticised Ford for \"stunts\" that it says \"are directly attacking the livelihoods of hundreds of Canadian workers\".Kinew, who enjoys the highest approval rating of any premier in Canada, said he recognised Ford was standing up for Ontarians but noted they \"are Canadians, just like the people here in Gimli\".He invited Ford to visit Manitoba to discuss the issue over a weekend ice hockey game between Toronto and Winnipeg. \"We can settle this thing and just put this episode behind us,\" Kinew said.Ford has \"politely declined\" the invite, Kinew told the BBC, but he noted that the two remain on good terms. \"We'll still find a way to talk to each other, even if we're on different sides of this issue,\" he said.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoChristal HayesandOsmond ChiaElon Musk's AI model Grok will no longer be able to edit photos of real people to show them in revealing clothing in jurisdictions where it is illegal, after widespread concern over sexualised AI deepfakes.\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing,\" reads an announcement on X.Reacting to the ban, the UK government claimed \"vindication\" after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called on X to control its AI tool.The change was announced hours after California's top prosecutor said the state was probing the spread of sexualised AI deepfakes, including of children, generated by the AI model.\"We now geoblock the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal,\" X said in a statement on Wednesday.It also reiterated that only paid users will be able to edit images using Grok on its platform.This will add an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that those who try and abuse Grok to violate the law or X's policies are held accountable, according to the statement.With NSFW (not safe for work) settings enabled, Grok is supposed to allow \"upper body nudity of imaginary adult humans (not real ones)\" consistent with what can be seen in R-rated films, Musk wrote online on Wednesday.\"That is the de facto standard in America. This will vary in other regions according to the laws on a country by country basis,\" said the tech multi-billionaire.Musk had earlier defended X, posting that critics \"just want to suppress free speech\" along with two AI-generated images of UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a bikini.In recent days, leaders around the world have criticised Grok's image editing feature.Over the weekend, Malaysia and Indonesia became the first countries to ban the Grok AI tool after users said photos had been altered to create explicit images without consent.Britain's media regulator, Ofcom, said on Monday that it would investigate whether X had failed to comply with UK law over the sexual images.If found to have broken the law, Ofcom could issue X with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18 million, whichever is greater.And if X does not comply, Ofcom could seek a court order to force internet service providers to block access to the site in the UK altogether.Sir Keir warned X could lose the \"right to self regulate\" amid a backlash over the AI images, but later in the week said he welcomed reports that X was taking action to address the issue.The prime minister said he would \"take the necessary measures\" and strengthen legislation if X failed to act.He had previously condemned the images created by the tool as \"disgusting and shameful\", and said the decision to \"turn this into a premium service is horrific\".X later said the changes to Grok would apply to \"all users, including paid subscribers\".California Attorney General Rob Bonta said on Wednesday: \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet.\"Policy researcher Riana Pfefferkorn said she is surprised X took so long to deploy the new Grok safeguards and that the editing features should have been removed as soon as the abuse began.Questions remain on how X will enforce its new policies, such as how the AI model will know if an image is of a real person and what actions it will take when users break the rules, said Pfefferkorn.Musk has not presented the company in a serious light either, she said, adding that it would help if he stopped \"doing things like re-posting an AI image of Keir Starmer in a bikini.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoNadine Yousif,Senior Canada reporterandLaura Bicker,China correspondent Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney is en route to China for a pivotal visit aimed at resetting ties with Beijing and finding new economic opportunities for his country outside the US.It will not be an easy task, with pressure on Canada to balance its goal of diversifying trade without risking damage to its relationship with Donald Trump or compromising national security and human rights commitments.But with ongoing uncertainty over Canada's trade future with the US – its largest customer – the country now finds itself seeking to repair strained relations to protect its economy.Senior Canadian officials have described the trip, the first to China by a Canadian prime minister since 2017, as \"consequential and historic\" and part of a \"bold\" plan to double Canada's non-US exports over the next decade.Trade will be on the agenda, along with agriculture and international security, Carney's office said. Beijing's foreign ministry said the two countries have \"shared interests\" and should work to \"increase people-to-people ties and cultural exchanges\".On Thursday, Carney meets the Premier of China, Li Qiang, as well as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Zhao Leji.On Friday, the prime minister is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping one-on-one, after the pair met last year on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.This official visit is a significant step in the rapprochement after Canada-China relations hit a low in 2018, following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a US warrant on fraud charges related to Iran sanctions violations. The detention in Canada of the executive of a Chinese telecom giant angered Beijing, and China subsequently arrested two Canadians on espionage charges. All three were released in 2021 after Meng cut a deal with US prosecutors.More recently, China has been accused of meddling in Canada's politics, though a public inquiry on foreign interference found its impact in recent federal elections to be minimal. China has repeatedly denied allegations of foreign meddling.Canada and China have struggled to forge meaningful ties in the past. Ottawa views China as \"an increasingly disruptive global power\"  that \"increasingly disregards\" international rules and norms, though it recognises China's size and influence make some cooperation necessary. The Carney government does not see this upcoming visit as a deviation from that view, senior Canadian government officials told reporters this week. But they added that Canada cannot achieve its objective of reducing economic reliance on the US without increasing trade with China.Carney is said to be approaching talks with an eye on increasing collaboration in areas of mutual interest like energy and climate, and putting guardrails on areas where the two countries clash, like defence and critical minerals.\"I think we are approaching the relationship now with the realism that we haven't seen for decades,\" Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat, told the BBC. Robertson added that it could result in a \"healthier relationship if both sides understand where they're coming from and what the red lines are\".It has already proven to be a careful line to walk. Ahead of Carney's visit, two Liberal MPs cut a sponsored trip to Taiwan short, telling the Globe and Mail newspaper that while Canada's position on Taiwan \"has not changed\", the trip ended early to \"avoid confusion with its foreign policy, given the overlap with the Prime Minister's engagement in Beijing\".One of Canada's main objectives during this trip is to ease Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola that have hurt farmers in the country's prairie provinces. China last year imposed the agriculture tariffs in a move widely seen as retaliation for Canadian levies on Chinese electric vehicles announced in 2024, mirroring similar levies by the US.In an editorial this week, state-run newspaper Global Times pointed to frustration expressed by Canadian farmers, suggesting \"perhaps this was the heavy price (Canada) paid for blindly following the US\". China has made it clear it wants the tariffs on EVs lifted.For China, Canada is seen as an important trading partner, with trade between the two countries valued at around $118bn in 2024. But crucially for Beijing, if President Xi manages to make a deal with Carney, it would give China more influence in a country that is on America's doorstep.The Global Times op-ed called on Ottawa to set a foreign policy path separate from that of the US and to exercise \"strategic autonomy\".One big unknown about this visit is how the US would react to any deals struck between Canada and China. Canada's economy has been hit by US tariffs, especially those on its steel, aluminium and automotive sectors. Talks to ease those levies remain on pause.Canada will soon, however, be engaged in consequential talks on renewing a long-standing North American free trade agreement with the US and Mexico that has shielded it from the bulk of Trump's sweeping tariffs. That review is set to be completed later this year.Robertson, the former diplomat, said it is likely that the Americans are watching the Canada-China relationship \"very closely\", and that Canada is keeping the US \"well informed\" of its intentions.But he added: \"At the end of the day, there's Canadian interests that we're pursuing.\"With additional reporting from Jessica Murphy in Toronto.

    "body": "Denmark warns of 'fundamental disagreement' after White House talks on Greenland5 hours agoDaniel Bush Washington correspondent, at the White HouseWatch: \"Fundamental disagreement\" with US over Greenland remains, says Danish foreign ministerDenmark's foreign minister has said there is a \"fundamental disagreement\" with the US over Greenland after talks at the White House.Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the meeting with Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday had been \"frank but constructive\". But he added that US President Trump was insisting on \"conquering\" Greenland which was \"totally unacceptable\". \"We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of [Denmark],\" he said.Trump afterwards reiterated his interest in acquiring the resource-rich island, a position that has rattled allies across Europe and stoked tensions with Nato.The hour-long meeting between the US, Denmark and Greenland failed to bring a major breakthrough, although all sides agreed to set-up a high-level working group to discuss the future of the autonomous Danish territory.Rasmussen said there were \"red lines\" the US could not cross, and the working group would meet in the coming weeks in an effort to find a compromise. He added that Denmark and Greenland were open to the possibility of the US opening more military bases on the island.\"It's productive to start discussions at a high level,\" he said.Rasmussen also said there was an \"element of truth\" in Trump's view that security should be bolstered to counter Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic. But he said the president's comments about the presence of Russian and Chinese warships  around Greenland were \"not true\".Watch: What message do Greenlanders want to send to Trump?Despite being a sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.Trump has repeatedly said acquiring it is vital to US national security. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip, a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.After the talks on Wednesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greenland Vivian Motzfeldt said the territory was open to greater co-operation with the US but also opposed a takeover.\"We have shown where our limits are,\" Motzfeldt said.Vance and Rubio did not immediately comment after the meeting. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters in the Oval Office: \"We need Greenland for national security.\"\"The problem is there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there's everything we can do,\" he said, adding that he does not believe the US can rely on Denmark to defend the island.The talks came as allies in Europe moved quickly to show support for Greenland.Sweden on Wednesday pledged to send armed forces to the territory at Denmark's request. Germany said in a statement provided to the BBC that it would send a \"reconnaissance team\" to Greenland to \"explore the general conditions for possible military contributions to support Denmark in ensuring security in the region\".Speaking in Sweden on Wednesday evening, the UK's Defence Secretary John Healey said after a request from Denmark, the UK would be sending one military officer as part of the reconnaissance team. France's foreign minister said the country planned to open a consulate on the island next month.French President Emmanuel Macron said his country would also participate in the reconnaissance team and that \"French military elements\" were already on the way to Greenland. Denmark said its military expansion in Greenland will take place \"in close co-operation with allies\".\"Geopolitical tensions have spread to the arctic,\" it said in a statement.The White House talks were just the latest round of diplomatic discussions over Trump's growing interest in the territory.It is unclear whether the president is considering using military force to seize the island, and he once again declined to rule it out when asked on Wednesday.Other options reportedly under consideration include purchasing the territory - though neither Danes nor Greenlanders have said it is for sale.Since taking office, Vance has criticised Denmark's stewardship of Greenland. The vice president visited soon after taking office.Trump has argued control of the territory is critical for his planned missile defence system, Golden Dome.\"It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,\" Trump said in a social media post early on Wednesday. \"NATO should be leading the way for us to get it.\"Public opinion polls suggest a majority of Greenland residents oppose coming under US control. The island's representative to the US says the last time Greenlanders were asked if they wanted to be part of the US, in January 2025, only 6% were in favour of doing so, while 85% were against. Most Americans oppose US control of Greenland as well. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday indicated that just 17% of Americans support the US seizing Greenland, compared to 47 percent who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island.The latest talks on Greenland follow US military operations in Venezuela and against ISIS targets in Syria. Trump has also threatened to take military action to stop Iran's crackdown on a growing protest movement engulfing the nation.",

    "body": "15 hours agoShayan Sardarizadeh,Merlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianBBCCrowds of masked protesters gather in Tehran Warning: this story contains content which some readers might find distressingDistressing new videos have emerged from a mortuary in Tehran showing rows of bodies, blood soaked floors and crowds of people searching for loved ones following a deadly government crackdown on protesters in Iran.The videos analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian, which are too graphic to show, contain some of the most shocking examples so far of how brutal the government's retaliation has been since the unrest began on 28 December.Forensic examination of the footage reveals nearly 200 bodies laid throughout the mortuary complex, many with visible wounds and one victim identified as young as 16. Anti-government demonstrations have spread to more than 68 towns and cities, verified videos show, though the true figure is likely to be much higher. The near total internet blackout imposed by the government since last week has left more than 90 million Iranians almost completely cut off from the outside world.The number of people who have been killed in the protests is not fully known. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) places the estimate at more than 2,500. An Iranian official previously told Reuters 2,000 people have been killed but claimed \"terrorists\" were to blame.A black body bag shows the date of birth of a 16-year-old victimBBC Verify and BBC Persian have previously reported on images emerging from this mortuary but we are not showing these new videos because the images are too graphic.The footage was posted on Tuesday by Vahid, a US-based Iranian social media influencer and activist, who said they were filmed on 10 January inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in south Tehran.Vahid said the videos were filmed by a man who had travelled nearly 1,000km to find internet access. The man told BBC Persian he used mobile networks from neighbouring countries to upload the footage. Vahid has been posting dozens of videos documenting events inside the country for the outside world to see. Two of the videos show rows of body bags on the floor as the man walks up and down a road that runs through the northern section of the vast mortuary complex. He later moves through a courtyard and inside a large warehouse, and walks in and out of adjacent rooms filled with more body bags. At one point he is heard describing the scene as \"the apocalypse\".The man filming is heard saying, \"Today is Saturday, a day after the call\". He is referring to the call made by Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah, for nationwide protests that took place last Thursday and Friday night.Two more clips contain a collection of photos taken from the mortuary showing several bodies wrapped in the zip-up bags, including one which appears burnt.BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in the five-minute video and at least 178 bodies in the 16-minute clip. The two videos likely show some of the same bodies so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.The videos contain at least nine separate clips edited together. The positions of shadows in the footage indicate these sections were likely filmed at different times throughout the day. We have matched identifiable features from the complex, including separate buildings, the red roof of a warehouse and fences with satellite images on Google.The man films as he moves around inside the centre, where more bodies are kept on stretchers as well as the floor. The footage shows some body bags fully zipped up while others are either half or entirely unzipped, revealing victims' faces and injuries. Some are completely uncovered. We can see blood-soaked towels and sheets scattered around the complex with streaks of blood on the floor.Body bags laid outside in the courtyard of the mortuary complexA number of the bodies have visible wounds. Two bodies appear to be soaked in blood, and another is seen with a deep stomach wound.Some body bags have papers attached to them or details written on the body bags in a white marker such as a name, national ID number, date of birth and death, and in some cases their father's name. At least two men are described as unidentified on a sheet of paper attached to their bag, and at least one woman and one teenager are among the victims.The date of death on three of the male victims' body bags states 9 January. Another body bag shows a date of birth using the Iranian calendar. It says 1/1/1388, which corresponds to 21/3/2009, indicating that it belongs to a 16-year-old.During one moment in the 16-minute clip the man points his phone at a building to his right and a voice can be heard saying: \"There are many [bodies] inside. It's not possible to go inside… this is the women's area\". Iranian mortuaries separate the bodies of men and women for religious reasons.At a different point we can see a body bag at the back of a hearse and a man nearby is heard telling a female official that it is his sister.  Verifying Iran protest footage as internet blackout passes 100 hoursSeveral ambulances, hearses and vans are filmed around the grounds. Officials are seen inspecting the rows of bodies, taking swabs from the victims, and talking to potential loved ones.It is not clear why the bodies of those killed in anti-government protests may have been transferred to the centre, but eyewitness accounts provided to BBC Persian suggest hospitals have been overwhelmed with the number of casualties in the protests.HRANA, which has been tracking the death toll since the unrest began, has reported that 2,403 protesters, 147 people affiliated with the government, nine civilians and 12 children have been killed so far.Crowds of people, many who appear to be family members and friends, are seen walking in and out of the complex as they try to identify the bodies. Cries and wails are repeatedly heard throughout the videos as people mourn the loss of their loves ones.\"Some of our best people have been killed,\" the man filming is heard saying.Iranian state TV has since reported that a \"substantial\" number of bodies had been taken to the mortuary. It claimed the majority of the victims were members of Iran's security forces or passers-by who had nothing to do with the demonstrations.Most international news organisation, including the BBC, are restricted from operating inside the country so we have to rely on verifying footage on social media.Additional reporting by Roja Assadi and Richard Irvine-Brown",

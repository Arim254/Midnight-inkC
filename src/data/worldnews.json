    "body": "18 hours agoHarry SekulichWatch: Stranded passengers walk past derailed train as wounded are carried from carriagesAt least 13 people died and almost 100 were injured in a train derailment in Mexico's south-eastern Oaxaca region, the Mexican navy said.The train, which was travelling between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, was carrying 241 passengers and nine crew members.A total of 98 were injured, of whom 36 were being treated in hospital, the navy said. The train derailed as it rounded a bend near the town of Nizanda, officials said. Mexico's Attorney General confirmed an investigation was under way.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said five of those injured were in a serious condition. She said top level officials, including the secretary of the navy, were travelling to the site of the crash.Photos from the site of the crash showed rescue workers helping passengers alight the train, which had fallen off the rail tracks and partly tilted over the side of a cliff.The Interoceanic train, which connects the Pacific port of Salina Cruz with Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf Coast, had two locomotives and four passenger cars, the navy said. Mexico's navy operates the country's railway network.The governor of Oaxaca, Salomón Jara Cruz, expressed \"deep regret\" over the accident in a statement and said state authorities were coordinating with federal agencies to assist those affected.The Interoceanic rail link was inaugurated two years ago to boost the region's economy, an initiative spearheaded by former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.Designed to modernise the rail link across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Mexican government has sought to develop the area into a strategic trade corridor, expanding ports, railways and industrial infrastructure.The train service is also part of a broader push to expand passenger and freight rail in southern Mexico and stimulate economic development in the region.",

    "body": "The man who disarmed one of the gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish event at Bondi Beach has revealed his thoughts in the moments before his heroic actions.In verified footage, Ahmed al Ahmed - a Sydney shop owner born and raised in Syria - tackled one of the two shooters from behind, wrestling a long-arm gun from him.\"I hold him with my right hand and start saying a word, you know, like to warn him -  'drop your gun, stop doing what you're doing',\" the father-of-two told the BBC's US partner CBS News in an exclusive interview.Mr Ahmed, who was shot several times by the other alleged gunman, said his actions saved \"lots of people... but I feel sorry still for the lost.\"In the interview, Mr Ahmed recalled the moment he tackled Sajid Akram, 50, who was shooting attendees at a Hanukkah event at Bondi Beach on Sunday 14 December. \"My target was just to take the gun from him, and to stop him from killing a human being's life and not killing innocent people.\"Fifteen people died during the attack - Australia's deadliest mass shooting since 1996 - and 40 others were injured. Police have declared the attack a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.Sajid Akram was shot dead by police while his son Naveed, the other alleged gunman who was hospitalised after the attack, has since been charged with 59 offences including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist attack.Mr Ahmed described the inner thoughts running through his head in the lead-up to his actions, which authorities and politicians have said saved countless lives. \"Emotionally, I'm doing something, which is I feel something, a power in my body, my brain,\" Mr Ahmed said. \"I don't want to see people killed in front of me, I don't want to see blood, I don't want to hear his gun, I don't want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help.\"That's my soul asking me to do that.\"In the days after the shooting, Mr Ahmed was presented with a cheque at his hospital bedside for A$2.5m (£1.24m; $1.7m) which had been raised from tens of thousands of community members moved by his actions. He was shot several times in the shoulder after tackling Sajid Akram and required at least three operations.Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Mr Ahmed in hospital, describing him as \"the best of our country\" while New South Wales Premier Chris Minns called him a \"real-life hero\".Earlier, Mr Ahmed's parents told BBC Arabic that their son was \"driven by his sentiment, conscience and humanity\".",

    "body": "A five-year-old boy in Japan has died while on a ski holiday with his family after his arm caught on a travelator.On Sunday morning Hinata Goto was about to step off the travelator at a Hokkaido resort's ski slopes when he fell down and his right arm became trapped in the machinery, Japanese media reported citing police. The travelator was equipped with a safety mechanism, but it failed to activate. The machine only halted when the boy's mother hit the emergency stop button.Rescue workers spent 40 minutes dismantling part of the travelator to free the boy, who by then had fallen unconscious. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.Staff at the Asarigawa Onsen Ski Resort in Otaru said that the travelator's safety mechanism, which was designed to immediately halt operations if it detected that an object was trapped in the machinery, had worked earlier in the day.Police are investigating the incident to assess whether there was any professional negligence, such as in the manufacturing and maintenance of the travelator.Installed about six years ago, the travelator is about 30m (98 ft) long and 60cm (24 in) wide, with no hand rails. It connects the resort's car park to the ski slopes.Japanese media quoted other visitors saying that they have stumbled while using the same travelator. \"Even as an adult, there are times when I think, 'It's a little scary',\" a regular customer told Asahi Shimbun.A representative of Asarigawa Onsen Ski Resort apologised for the incident and said they will take action to prevent a recurrence.Hokkaido is known to be the ski capital of Japan and welcomes millions of visitors every year, with the bulk of them staying during the winter months for ski holidays.",

He was also taken to hospital for treatment and is under police guard.Local media has suggested the man was suffering from mental health issues, citing officials and residents, while the South American nation's president said his family and neighbours were among the victims.\"At a time when family and friends should be holding on to and supporting each other, we are confronted with the harsh reality that there is another side to the world,\" Jennifer Geerlings-Simons said in a statement.\"I wish all the bereaved much strength, courage and comfort during this unimaginably difficult time.\"Police said further details about the circumstances of the incident would follow. Suriname is among nations with the lowest rates of stabbing deaths, making incidents such as this one relatively rare.However, it has endured several coups and a civil war since gaining its independence from the Netherlands in 1975.",

    "body": "Italian police have arrested nine people accused of raising around €7m (£6m) for Hamas over more than two years.The money was ostensibly collected as humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians, a police statement said, but was instead sent to the militant group via a \"complex fundraising system\".Alongside the arrests, police say they have seized more than €8m (£7m) in assets as part of the investigation. Police say the suspects are \"specifically accused of carrying out financing operations believed to have contributed to terrorist activities\".The arrests were made as part of a joint initiative between Italy's counter-terror police and financial police.The investigation began after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack in southern Israel. Police say they analysed \"a series of reports of suspicious financial transactions\" involving some of the suspects in the lead up to the attack.Investigators uncovered a \"complex\" system of fundraising, which was headquartered in Genoa with branches in Milan, the statement adds.\"The suspects collected donations intended for the civilian population of Gaza, however, it emerged that over 71% of these funds were diverted to Hamas's coffers to finance its military wing and support the families of suicide bombers or those detained for terrorism,\" the police statement says.Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the most well-known of the arrested suspects was Mohammad Hannoun, the president of the Palestinian Association in Italy.Piantedosi thanked police for their work in a post on X, but also noted that \"the presumption of innocence... must always be recognised at this stage\".Mr Hannoun said that he is \"neither closely nor remotely\" related to Hamas but has always supported them. \"I have always declared with utmost transparency that I am a Palestinian citizen and publicly support the legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people,\" he told reporters.",

    "body": "The Albanian nationalist Vetevendosje party has won a landslide victory in Kosovo's parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results. With 90% of the votes counted, the party, whose name means \"self determination\", was on 50.8%, meaning a third term in power for its leader, Albin Kurti. The two main opposition parties, the centre-right Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), were on 20.98% and 13.89%, respectively.Vetevendosje won elections in February, but without a majority, and Kosovo has been without a functioning government since then. The impasse meant there was one big question hanging over this second parliamentary election of the year. Would voters punish Kurti for the long months of deadlock in the country's National Assembly – or the opposition parties who refused to countenance a coalition with Kurti's left-wing movement?The electorate has given a clear answer. This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.It is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.Kurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.Arben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.There is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.Repairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.The EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.The fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.One analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power. But he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".",

    "body": "A cruise ship has run aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on its first trip since the death of an elderly passenger in late October. The Coral Adventurer is currently under investigation over the death of Suzanne Rees, 80, who died on a remote Australian island after being left behind by the ship. On Saturday, the vessel suffered a \"grounding incident\" off the eastern coast of PNG, around 30km (18 miles) from the city of Lae, a spokesperson for the ship said. All passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship have been reported safe, and initial inspections have not revealed any damage to the hull. Further inspections will take place on Sunday. A spokesperson for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) told the BBC in a statement that it had not received a distress call from the Coral Adventurer.It added it was monitoring the situation and would support PNG authorities if necessary. No decisions have been made about the current 12-day voyage, which was due to finish on 30 December.There were 80 passengers and 43 crew members aboard the ship at the time of the incident.The Coral Adventurer is currently the subject of a joint investigation by Amsa and Queensland Police, Ms Rees was found dead on Lizard Island on 26 October.She had been hiking on the island with fellow passengers, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The ship was just two days into a 60-day voyage at the time of Ms Rees's death. The remainder of the cruise was cancelled with full refunds offered to all passengers.  The CEO of Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.Mr Fifield added that the cruise operator was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Amsa was not able to comment on the status of the investigation, and told the BBC that it was \"not in the practice of making the results of its investigations public\".

    "body": "10 hours agoYvette TanGetty ImagesThe Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian sideThailand's army has accused Cambodia of breaching a newly signed ceasefire deal reached after weeks of deadly clashes that forced nearly one million people from their homes. In a statement, the Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian side on Sunday night.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Both sides agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible.It had been seen as a breakthrough, which came after days of talks between both countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US. In a statement on Monday, the Royal Thai Army said Cambodia's actions \"constitute provocation and a violation of measures aimed at reducing tensions\", adding that they were \"inconsistent\" with the terms of the ceasefire.It also said it \"may need to reconsider\" the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers held in Thailand since July. Thailand would be \"obliged to act in accordance... [if] violations of agreements and national sovereignty continue\", it added.Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn described the incident as \"a small issue related to flying drones seen by both sides along the border line,\" according to AFP news agency. It comes just hours after China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi praised the \"hard-won\" ceasefire, and US President Donald Trump praised the \"rapid and fair conclusion\".The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is not new, dating back more than a century.The latest tensions ramped up earlier this year, after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May. This plunged relations between the countries to their lowest point in more than a decade.There were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.A fragile ceasefire deal was agreed in July and signed in October. It then collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.",

    "body": "1 day agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystThe number of executions in Iran in 2025 is estimated to have more than doubled compared to the number that took place across the country in 2024. Norwegian-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) group told the BBC it had verified at least 1,500 executions up until the start of December, adding that many more have taken place since.Last year, IHR was able to verify 975 executions - although the exact number is never completely clear as Iranian authorities do not give official figures.However, the analysis shows another significant annual rise, and the figures chime with those provided by other monitoring groups.Iran's government has previously defended its use of the death penalty, saying it is limited to only \"the most severe crimes\".Execution figures were already on the rise before mass demonstrations broke out across the country in 2022 following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini.The 22-year-old Kurdish woman was detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab \"improperly\".That protest movement represented the biggest challenge to the legitimacy of Iran's theocratic leadership for many years.In response, authorities intensified the rate of executions from around 520 in 2022 to 832 the following year - according to the figures verified by IHR.There have been some executions for protesters or alleged spies - but 99% of those executed have been for murder or drug offences - a ratio which has remained constant.Activists have said that the rate of executions in Iran increases when the regime feels under threat and that the aim is to forestall internal opposition by instilling fear in the population.It seems to be borne out by the fact that since the 12-day war with Israel in June, as well as major setbacks for Iran's proxy forces across the region, there's been another big surge.",

The five identical sisters, born in Ontario at the height of the Great Depression in 1934, were the first known quintuplets to survive past infancy. They quickly became a global sensation during their childhood - starring in feature films, appearing on the covers of magazines, and endorsing products from toothpaste to syrup. \"Much beloved, Annette had championed children's rights,\" the museum said in a statement announcing her death.

    "body": "Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has received a medical procedure to treat his chronic hiccups, his medical team has said.Saturday's treatment \"went well\", according to one of his doctors. Another, Claudio Birolini, added that the procedure - which he stressed was not a surgery - lasted for \"about an hour\".The far-right former leader is currently serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the Latin American nation's 2022 presidential election to left-wing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.This latest procedure comes after the 70-year-old successfully underwent surgery for a double hernia earlier this week, after being granted permission to be transferred to hospital.Ahead of the surgery, Bolsonaro also endorsed his son Flávio to run against Lula in Brazil's 2026 presidential election. His statement - a handwritten letter - was read out by the younger Bolsonaro outside the hospital.Following the successful surgery, his medical team deemed it necessary to treat his recurrent hiccups, which he had been suffering from for months.\"It's been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups,\" Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, said on Saturday.She explained in a social media post that her husband's procedure had \"blocked\" one of his phrenic nerves.The phrenic nerves contract and expand the diaphragm, which allows the lungs to inhale and exhale. Hiccups are caused by the involuntary spasming of the diaphragm, typically as a result of an irritated phrenic nerve.His doctors later confirmed they had treated the right phrenic nerve and had scheduled to work on the left nerve on Monday.Once discharged from hospital, the former president will return to a cell in the federal police headquarters to continue serving his sentence. Bolsonaro was found guilty of the coup plot in September. He was placed under house arrest pending appeals, but was taken into police custody last month after being deemed a \"concrete flight risk\".Court officials said he had attempted to break his ankle monitor and planned to use a rally outside his house as cover for an escape attempt. Bolsonaro insisted he had no intention of fleeing.Also on Saturday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest of 10 officials for participating in his coup attempt. All of them had served in his government.",

    "body": "19 hours agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringThe much-anticipated talks lasted two-and-a-half hours, and that's an achievement in itself. Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.Trump says progress made in Ukraine talks but 'thorny issues' remainThere is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.",

    "body": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied allegations by Russia that Ukraine launched a drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences, and accused Moscow of trying to derail peace talks. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Kyiv had launched an attack overnight using 91 long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on Putin's state residence in Russia's northwestern Novgorod region.Russia said it would now review its position in peace negotiations. It is not yet clear where Putin was at the time of the alleged attack.Zelensky dismissed the claim as \"typical Russian lies\", intended to give the Kremlin an excuse to continue attacks on Ukraine. He said that Russia had previously targeted government buildings in Kyiv.Zelensky added on X: \"It is critical that the world doesn't stay silent now. We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace.\"In a statement shared on Telegram on Monday, Lavrov said all of the 91 drones he claimed were launched at Putin's residence were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defence systems.He added that there were no reports of casualties or damage as a result of the attack.\"Given the final degeneration of the criminal Kyiv regime, which has switched to a policy of state terrorism, Russia's negotiating position will be revised,\" he said.But he added that Russia does not intend to exit the negotiating process with the US, Russian news agency Tass reported.The claim by Moscow comes after talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida on Sunday, where Presidents Trump and Zelensky discussed a revised peace plan to end the war.Zelensky said the US had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, and Trump said an agreement on this point was \"close to 95%\" done.Ukraine's leader described territorial issues and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as the last unresolved matters, and there was little sign of progress on the future of Ukraine's contested Donbas region - which Russia wants to seize in full.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Russia has previously rejected key parts of the plan under discussion.The White House said on Monday that President Trump had \"concluded a positive call\" with Putin, following the US-Ukraine talks. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide, told reporters on Monday that during the call, Putin had pointed out the alleged attack on his residence happened \"almost straight after what the US had considered to be a successful round of talks\".Ushakov said: \"The US president was shocked by this information, he was angry and said he couldn't believe such mad actions. It was stated that this will no doubt affect the US approach to working with Zelensky\".During a later press conference, Trump initially appeared to say he did not know about the alleged incident, but later told reporters that he was told about it by Putin and was \"very angry\" about it. Asked if the US had seen any evidence supporting Russia's claim, he responded: \"Well we'll find out. You're saying maybe the attack didn't take place - that's possible too, I guess. But President Putin told me this morning it did\". ",

    "body": "1 day agoThomas MackintoshGetty ImagesThe Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute issued alerts for strong winds across large parts of northern Sweden as Storm Johannes hitA third person has died in Sweden after a powerful winter storm swept across Nordic countries, causing travel disruption and power outages.Sweden's meteorological agency issued alerts for strong winds for large parts of the northern half of the country as Storm Johannes hit.One man in his 50s died after being struck by a tree at the Kungsberget ski resort in the country's south, local media and police reported. Further north, regional utility company Hemab said one of its employees died in an accident while out working.Police also said a man in his 60s was taken to hospital after being hit by a tree while working in a forest in Hofors, east-central Sweden, and later died of his injuries.Tens of thousands of homes in Sweden, Norway and Finland have been left without power as a result of the storm.In Sweden, more than 40,000 homes were affected by power outages and numerous rail services were cancelled, Swedish news agency TT reported.Several flights, rail and ferry services across parts of the Nordic nations have been cancelled. Roads and rail services have also been disrupted due to the storm conditions.In Norway's Nordland region, one of the most northerly counties in the country, the fire department responded to more than 200 weather‑related incidents, broadcaster NRK reported.Storm Johannes cut power to around 23,000 homes in Nordland and a further 9,000 were without electricity in the Inland region, according to NRK.In Finland, the storm - known there as Hannes - subsided on Sunday morning but had left more than 60,000 homes without power, according to public broadcaster Yle.Flights at Kittila airport in northern Finland were grounded after heavy winds pushed a passenger jet and a smaller plane off the runway and into a bank of snow, the Helsinki Times reported.The Swiss Air jet, carrying about 150 passengers, had just landed from Geneva and was taxiing when it veered off, the paper said. The smaller jet, a 400XT model, was on the ground at the same time and was also pushed off course by the wind, it added.There have been no reported injuries.",

    "body": "The United States has pledged $2 billion (£1.5bn) to fund United Nations (UN) humanitarian programmes, but has warned the UN it must \"adapt or die\". The announcement was made in Geneva by Jeremy Lewin, President Trump's Under Secretary for Foreign Assistance, and the UN's emergency relief chief, Tom Fletcher.It comes amid huge cuts in US funding for humanitarian operations, and further cuts expected from other donors, such as the UK and Germany.Mr Fletcher welcomed the new funds, saying they would save \"millions of lives\". But $2 billion is just a fraction of what the US has traditionally spent on aid. In 2022 its contribution to the UN's humanitarian work was estimated at $17 billion (£12.6bn).And the funding comes with some strings attached. Although UN donors do sometimes earmark specific projects, the UN funding prioritises just 17 countries, among them Haiti, Syria, and Sudan.Afghanistan and Yemen will not, Mr Lewin said, receive any money, adding that Washington had evidence that in Afghanistan UN funds were being diverted to the Taliban and that \"President Trump will never tolerate a penny of taxpayers' money going to terrorist groups\".Such restrictions will be hard for aid agencies working in countries not on the list. The impact of funding cuts has already led to the closure of mother and baby clinics in Afghanistan, and reductions in food rations for displaced people in Sudan. Globally, child mortality, which has been declining, is set to rise this year.The conditions placed on the new US funding also rule out spending money on projects related to tackling climate change, which Mr Lewin said were not \"life saving\", and not in \"the US interest\".Mr Lewin, a Trump loyalist who reportedly masterminded the shutdown of USAID and the firing of its thousands of staff, warned the UN that it must \"adapt or die\", saying that the US \"piggy bank is not open to those organisations that just want to return to the old system\".The US says funding must be focused and efficient, with no duplication among aid projects. These are qualities Tom Fletcher, and the entire UN system, say they wholeheartedly support. It's in no one's interests, least of all those of the estimated 200 people caught up in crises, for money to be spent unwisely.But while the UN is gratefully welcoming the new US funding, there remain big questions about whether the conditions around it are too politicised. The fundamental principles of humanitarian aid are that it should be neutral, impartial, and directed at those most in need. Eliminating specific countries, or specific crises such as climate change, challenges those principles.But, as it struggles with a continued funding crises, and, in Washington, a very skeptical donor, many in the UN will be acknowledging that $2 billion is better than nothing.",

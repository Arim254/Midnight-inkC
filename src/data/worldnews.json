    "body": "A far-left activist group in Germany has claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that left tens of thousands of homes, as well as hospitals and businesses, without power in around-freezing temperatures.The Vulkangruppe (Volcano Group) said in a statement that the fossil fuel economy, not cutting power, was the target of the action.It will take until Thursday to reconnect power for all customers, with some schools due to be closed at the start of this week.Early on Saturday, several cables on a bridge were spotted burning near a power plant in south-west Berlin. The fire was quickly put out, but around 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses were left without electricity.The state economy minister told German media that incendiary devices had caused the damage.Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, accusing \"suspected left-wing extremists\" of knowingly endangering lives, especially those of patients in hospitals.Hospitals and care facilities had received emergency power generators, officials said. The response had included transferring individuals from care sites and people requiring care in their own homes from the affected area to care facilities with reported available capacity.Some hospitals had their electricity restored by Sunday.As of Sunday afternoon, around 10,000 households and 300 businesses had been reconnected, with most still waiting to receive power back.Some schools, which were due to reopen on Monday after the Christmas holidays, will remain closed.The capital's electricity operator said it would take until Thursday to reconnect all customers.The Vulkangruppe in its statement apologised to less affluent residents impacted by the power cuts, but said it had less sympathy for \"the many owners of villas\".The statement said the attack on the gas-fired power plant was an \"act of self-defence\" and solidarity with those who protect the earth.Police told AFP news agency they believed the statement was \"plausible\" while they continued to investigate, with other media reporting police thought it was credible.The Vulkangruppe previously claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that halted production at Tesla's Berlin car factory in 2024.",

    "body": "14 hours agoAleks PhillipsandNikos PapanikolaouGetty ImagesThessaloniki Airport closed entirely after air traffic communication was knock outThousands of passengers are stranded across Europe after a communications failure forced Greece to close its airspace, causing widespread cancellations and delays.Officials are working to understand why radio communications were disrupted on Sunday morning, prompting the temporary suspension of arrivals and departures.Some departures have since been allowed to resume - though inbound flights are still being told to divert or return to their point of origin. Athens' main airport is among the worst affected, while Thessaloniki airport has closed entirely.The timing of the disruption has raised fears that travellers will not be able to get home before the start of the working week.\"I was supposed to fly to London, via Stockholm, with SAS,\" one passenger at Athens International Airport told Greek broadcaster Mega TV. \"I'm working on Newport Hospital tomorrow morning. I'm not going to be there on time, I don't know what else to say. \"Who is going to pay for the additional cost this travel will cost me? We still don't know if and when we're going to leave, no one is telling us anything.\"More than 90 flights have been affected in and out of Athens airport alone - though some flights have since been able to resume.A member of staff in the airport told the BBC that 35 aircraft an hour were now being allowed to take off, but it was still unable to take inbound flights.Flights departing from Dublin, Barcelona and Paris were earlier ordered to return to their airports of origin, while services from Copenhagen and Malta were cancelled altogether. Other arrivals into Athens were placed on standby, while flights in and out of other Greek airports have also been affected. Three flights out of Heraklion airport on the island of Crete, including one to Munich, have been delayed, according to public broadcaster ERT.Most inbound flights are being diverted to Turkey if not cancelled outright, it reports.Reuters / Flightradar24Greek airspace was nearly empty earlier on Sunday due to the technical faultThe disruption comes at a busy time for air travel in and out of Athens, which typically sees more than 600 scheduled flights per day, as people return from winter holidays.In the chaos, some passengers have complained of a lack of information. One told news site Flash: \"We have no updates. They told us that we will be able to leave but I don't think this is true. On the departures board I can't see my flight, and I'm supposed to leave shortly.\"Another, who had been on a flight to Rhodes when it turned around and headed back to Athens, told news agency Reuters: \"From that moment until now we have no information whatsoever.\"Domestic travellers may have the option of getting home on Greece's rail network, but this would take significantly longer.The issue that caused the disruption is thought to concern the radio system used by air traffic controllers to communicate with planes in their airspace.Panagiotis Psarros, chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers, told ERT that all frequencies were \"suddenly lost\", adding: \"We could not communicate with aircraft in the sky.\"The broadcaster later reported than an initial investigation by the Greek security services suggested the problem may be due to the failure of an antenna in the Gerania Mountains near Athens. Italy, Turkey and Cyprus are assisting Greece in managing the situation.",

    "body": "4 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesA national day of mourning has been announced in Switzerland for 9 JanuaryThe bodies of the 40 victims of a bar fire in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve have been identified by police.The victims range in age from 14 to 39 years old, with 15 aged under 18. The youngest were a Swiss girl and a French boy, both 14. The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish, Portuguese, French, and Belgian nationalities, as well as a citizen of the UK, France and Israel.In addition to the 40 killed, 119 others were injured. Most have severe burns - six of them so severe that they have yet to be identified. A criminal investigation into the French couple who managed Le Constellation bar is under way. Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.Police said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.However, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce her is 16-year-old son, Arthur, was one of the dead. \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light,\" she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message. He \"has left to party in paradise\", she said.While Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been \"living a nightmare\".Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookArthur Brodard's mother posted a moving tribute to her sonLe Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.SUPPLIEDVideo from inside the bar appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fireThe French couple who own the bar - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office for the Valais region said.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".A teenager who went to two schools in the UK has been confirmed as one of the victims killed in the fire. Charlotte Niddam, who was believed to be 15, previously attended Immanuel College in Hertfordshire and the Jewish Free School in north-west London, according to reports.In a post on social media, the teenager's family announced her death \"with great sadness\" and said details of her funeral arrangements would be made in due course. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also confirmed the news in a post on X.Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as the first identified victim of the fire following a statement from the Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father is quoted as saying his son was at Le Constellation. A spokesperson for the Italian foreign ministry previously told the BBC it would not confirm the death.",

It is illegal to pay ransom money to the criminal groups, which the government has classified as terrorists, but there are claims this is often ignored.Zakari KontagoraThe attack on Kasuwan-Daji is the latest is a spike of violent attacks against villages in Niger stateA witness to the attack told BBC Hausa that there were no security forces in the village. \"We want the government to help us. In the past, we used to hear about this problem in other places, but now it is happening in our villages,\" he said.The fear is driving people from their homes where they were born and raised.\"We are dying like chickens, and does the government care about us? \"The government hears and sees what is happening, but it is not doing anything about it. What can we do as ordinary people?\"Zakari KontagoraVillagers say the attacks are driving people away from the villages they grew up in",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" in reference to demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

    "body": "1 hour agoThomas MackintoshReutersDenmark's prime minister has told Donald Trump to \"stop the threats\" about taking over Greenland.Mette Frederiksen said \"it makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland\", adding: \"The US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom.\"Her remarks come after Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's aides, Stephen Miller - tweeted a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag alongside the word \"SOON\".Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of Greenland becoming an annexed part of the US, citing its strategic location and mineral wealth, and doubled down on his claims after Frederiksen's comments. In her statement, posted on the Danish government website, Frederiksen said she was addressing the US \"very directly\".She said Denmark - \"and thus Greenland\" - was a Nato member and covered by the alliance's security guarantee. Denmark already had a defence agreement with the US that gave it access to Greenland, she said, and Denmark had upped its investment in security in the Arctic region.\"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have very clearly said that they are not for sale,\" she said.Hours later on Air Force One, Trump reiterated the goal. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it,\" he said.Earlier the Danish ambassador to the US responded to the post by Ms Miller - a right-wing podcaster and former aide to Trump during his first term - with a \"friendly reminder\" that the two countries were allies and saying Denmark expected respect for its territorial integrity.The exchange comes after the US carried out a major military operation against Venezuela on Saturday, capturing its president Nicolas Maduro and his wife and removing them to New York.Trump later said the US would \"run\" Venezuela and US oil companies would \"start making money for the country\".The US president has previously refused to rule out using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve US security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark.Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.More on this story",

Given what a vital economic partner China is, experts say Lee is looking for assurances that it would not weaponise that relationship in the face of political tensions in the region.For weeks, China and Japan have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the former's claim on self-governed Taiwan, which puts Seoul, a key regional power, in an awkward spot.Beijing ramped up the rhetoric against Japan after its prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in parliament that Tokyo could respond with its own self defence force in case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. So visiting Beijing at this time is a significant move for Lee. Like Japan, South Korea too is an ally of the US, which supports Taiwan and supplies arms for its defence.  Lee, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, will attend a banquet hosted by Xi on Monday. He will then meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji, before flying to Shanghai.Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".This is the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. The relationship soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China.    On the other side, Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC.\"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\"Beijing has been leveraging the two countries' shared history of fighting against Japan during the 20th Century, Mr Park said. Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan.While Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park added.Seoul has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Takaichi. And on Friday, South Korea's national security director Wi Sung-lac told reporters the country \"respects the One China policy\" - the diplomatic acknowledgment that Beijing is the only Chinese government. Security on the Korean Peninsula will also be part of the discussions with China, Wi told reporters.Lee has sought to engage North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far. He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is the dictator's biggest supporter, economically and diplomatically, Russia aside.\"China is a very important cooperative partner in moving toward peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula,\" Lee said on Sunday.Earlier in the day Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, a reference to  the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies. US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.There are other sore spots, such as China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region. Persuading Beijing to lift these restrictions is said to be high on Lee's agenda. China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.                                                        Lee would also be seeking to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.",

    "body": "10 hours agoTom BennettGetty ImagesWhen US forces conducted a night raid on the Venezuelan capital Caracas, they didn't just drag President Nicolás Maduro from his compound and put him on a boat to New York - they took his wife too.Cilia Flores, 69, has long been seen as one of the most powerful figures in Venezuela, a political operator in her own right who for decades has shaped the country's fortunes.After years leading Venezuela's National Assembly, she helped consolidate her husband's grip on power after his 2013 presidential election victory.As First Lady, she was dubbed \"First Warrior\" by Maduro. But in that role she publicly took a backseat - presenting a more family-oriented face to what critics say was a brutal regime.She hosted a TV show, Con Cilia en Familia, and made occasional appearances on state television to dance salsa with her husband. But behind-the-scenes, she is thought to have been one of Maduro's key advisers, and an architect of his political survival.Flores has faced allegations of corruption and nepotism, and in recent years her family members have been found guilty in US courts of cocaine smuggling. She will now face drug trafficking and weapons charges in a New York court, along with her husband.Flores met Maduro in the early 1990s, when - as a young up-and-coming lawyer - she took on the defence of the plotters of the failed 1992 coup attempt.Chief among them: Hugo Chávez, the man who would later become president.It was during those years that she met Maduro, who at the time was working for Chávez as a security guard.AFP via Getty ImagesMonths of unrest followed Venezuela's failed 1992 coup, which saw a number of military commanders, including Hugo Chávez, imprisoned\"I met Cilia in life,\" Maduro recounted. \"She was the lawyer for several imprisoned patriotic military officers. But she was also Commander Chávez's lawyer and, well, being Commander Chávez's lawyer in prison... tough.\"\"I met her during those years of struggle, and then, well, she caught my eye.\"From then, both their fates became linked to Chávez and his political movement, known as Chavismo.After Chávez won the presidency in 1998, Flores quickly rose through the political ranks, joining the National Assembly in 2000 and becoming its leader in 2006.For six years she led a virtually one-party parliament, with the main opposition parties refusing to participate in elections, saying they were not free and fair.When Chávez died in 2013, Flores threw her weight behind Maduro, who narrowly won the subsequent presidential election.AFP via Getty ImagesFlores remained close with Chávez until his death in 2013Months later the pair married, formalising a years-long relationship in which they'd lived together, raising children from previous relationships: three of hers and one of his.\"She became a critical piece in Maduro's regime,\" said José Enrique Arrioja, a Venezuelan journalist and managing editor of Americas Quarterly.\"She was not only the emotional confidant of Maduro, but the professional confidant too. And she was very power-driven.\"Getty ImagesAs president of the National Assembly, Flores was one of the most powerful figures in VenezuelaAcross her career, she has faced numerous allegations of corruption.In 2012, she was accused by unions of nepotism for influencing the hiring of up to 40 people, including numerous members of her family.\"My family came here and I am very proud that they are my family. I will defend them,\" she responded.In November 2015, she became embroiled in the \"Narco nephews\" case, when two of her nephews -  Francisco Flores de Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores - were arrested in Haiti in a sting operation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).They were caught trying to smuggle 800kg of cocaine into the US.Flores accused US authorities of having \"kidnapped\" her nephews - but a judge sentenced the two men to 18 years in prison for drug trafficking. They were returned to Venezuela in 2022 as part of a prisoner swap under the Biden administration.But last month, the Trump administration announced fresh sanctions on the two nephews - as well as a third nephew, Carlos Erik Malpica Flores - with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying: \"Nicolás Maduro and his criminal associates in Venezuela are flooding the United States with drugs that are poisoning the American people.\"\"Treasury is holding the regime and its circle of cronies and companies accountable for its continued crimes,\" he added.The newly unsealed indictment against Flores accuses her - among other things - of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between \"a large-scale drug trafficker\" and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office.\"To her detractors, she is seen as part of a deeply corrupt, human-rights-abusing and brutal government,\" says Christopher Sabatini, Senior Fellow and Chatham House's Latin America programme.\"She was a power behind the throne,\" he adds. \"But like any good power behind the throne, you really didn't see her hand that much, so no one really knew how powerful she was.\"She is expected in court on Monday.

    "body": "5 hours agoChris BockmanParisBBCThe course attracts both typical early 20s students and French government spies on day releaseUniversity professor Xavier Crettiez admits that he doesn't know the real names of many of the students on his course.This is a highly unusual state of affairs in the world of academia, but Prof Crettiez's work is far from standard.Instead, he helps train France's spies.\"I rarely know the intelligence agents' backgrounds when they are sent on the course, and I doubt the names I'm given are genuine anyway,\" he says.If you wanted to create a setting for a spy school, then the campus of Sciences Po Saint-Germain on the outskirts of Paris seems a good fit.With dour, even gloomy-looking, early 20th Century buildings surrounded by busy, drab roads and large, intimidating metal gates, it has a very discreet feel.Where it does stand out is its unique diploma that brings together more typical students in their early 20s, and active members of the French secret services, usually between the ages of 35 and 50.The course is called Diplôme sur le Renseignement et les Menaces Globales, which translates as Diploma of Intelligence and Global Threats.It was developed by the university in association with the Academie du Renseignement, the training arm of the French secret services.This came following a request from French authorities a decade ago. After the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the government went on a large recruitment drive within the French intelligence agencies.It asked Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities, to come up with a new course to both train potential new spies, and provide continuous training for current agents.Large French companies were also quick to show an interest, both in getting their security staff onto the course, and snapping up many of the younger graduates.Prof Xavier Crettiez says that fighting financial crime is a now key job for spiesThe diploma is made up of 120 hours of classwork with modules spread over four months. For external students – the spies and those on placement from businesses – it costs around €5,000 ($5,900; £4,400).The core aim of the course is to identify threats wherever they are, and how to track and overcome them. The key topics include the economics of organized crime, Islamic jihadism, business intelligence gathering and political violence.To attend one of the classes and speak to the students I had to be vetted first by the French security services. The theme of the lesson I joined was \"intelligence and over-reliance on technology\".One of the students I speak to is a man in his 40s who goes by the name Roger. He tells me in very precise, clipped English that he is investment banker. He adds: \"I provide consultancy across west Africa, and I joined the course to provide risk assessments to my clients there.\"Prof Crettiez, who teaches political radicalisation, says there has been a huge expansion in the French secret services in recent years. And that there are now around 20,000 agents in what he called the \"inner circle\".This is made up of the DGSE, which looks at matters overseas, and is the French equivalent of the UK's MI6 or the US's CIA. And the DGSI, which focuses on threats within France, like the UK's MI5 or the US's FBI.But he says it's not just about terrorism. \"There are the two main security agencies, but also Tracfin an intelligence agency which specializes in money laundering.\"It is preoccupied with the surge in mafia activity, especially in southern France, including corruption in the public and private sectors mainly due to massive profits in illegal drug trafficking.\"Other lecturers on the course include a DGSE official once located in Moscow, a former French ambassador to Libya, and a senior official from Tracfin. The head of security at the French energy giant EDF also runs one module.The private sector's interest in the diploma is said to be continuing to grow. Big businesses, especially in the defence and aerospace sector, but also French luxury goods firms, are increasingly keen to hire the students as they face relentless cybersecurity and spying threats as well as sabotage.Recently graduates have been snapped up by the French mobile phone operator Orange, aerospace and defence giant Thales, and LVHM, which owns everything from Louis Vuitton and Dior to champagne brands Dom Perignon and Krug.Twenty eight students are enrolled in this year's class. Six are spies. You can tell who they are, as they are the ones huddled together during class breaks, away from the young students, and not too overwhelmed with joy when I approach them.Without saying their exact roles, and with arms crossed, one says the course is considered a fast-track stepping stone for a promotion from the office to field work. Another says he gets fresh ideas being in this academic environment. They signed the day's attendance form with just their first names.One of the younger students, Alexandre Hubert, 21, says he wanted a deeper understanding of the looming economic war between Europe and China. \"Looking at intelligence gathering from a James Bond viewpoint is not relevant, the job is analysing risk and working out how to counteract it,\" he tells me.Another class member, Valentine Guillot, also 21, says she was inspired by the popular, fictional French TV spy drama Le Bureau. \"Coming here to discover this world which I didn't know anything about except for the TV series has been a remarkable opportunity, and now I am very keen to join the security services.\"Students Alexandre Hubert and Valentine Guillot were happy to be photographedNearly half of the students in the class are in fact women. And this is a relatively recent development according to one of the lecturers, Sebastien-Yves Laurent, a specialist on technology in spying.\"Women's interest in intelligence gathering is new,\" he says. \"They are interested  because they think it will provide for a better world.\"And if there is one common thread amongst all these young students it's that they are very patriotic and that is new compared to 20 years ago.If you are keen to apply to get on the course, French citizenship is an essential requirement, although some dual citizens are accepted.Sciences Po Saint-GermainIn a recent class photo some students chose to stand with their backs to the cameraYet Prof Crettiez says he has to be wary. \"I regularly get applications from very attractive Israeli and Russian women with amazing CVs. Unsurprisingly they are binned immediately.\"In a recent group photo of the class you can immediately tell who the spies are - they had their backs to the camera.While all the students and professional spies I met are trim and athletic, Prof Crettiez is also keen to dispel the myth of James Bond-like adventure.\"Few new recruits will end up in the field,\" he says. \"Most French intelligence agencies jobs are desk bound.\"",

    "body": "Raw emotions as mourners attend Mass for Swiss bar fire victims7 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, Crans MontanaReutersLaetitia Brodard, whose teenage son Arthur died in the fire, was comforted by friendsIn the snow-dusted street outside St Christopher's Church, hundreds joined a special Sunday Mass for the victims of the fire that tore through Le Constellation bar on New Year's Eve.Many hugged each other, crying quietly, as they remembered the dozens killed and those still in hospital with severe burns, fighting for their lives.During the service, several in the crowd fainted and fell to the ground, overcome.All 40 of the dead have now been identified, although not named publicly. Their bodies are being returned to their families, some of whom who had been holding on to the hope their children might yet be found - injured, but alive.They're now receiving the worst possible news.Ever since the fire, Laetitia Brodard had been posting pictures of her teenage son Arthur online and appealing for help to find him. On Sunday, she was at the memorial service, being comforted by friends.\"He died that first day,\" Laetitia confirmed to me.In an emotional statement on Facebook, she said that Arthur had \"gone to party in paradise\".The victims' bodies were so badly burned by the fire they were difficult to identify. Even some of those injured and in hospitals haven't been named yet - they remain unconscious and unrecognisable.For the dead, forensics experts had to use DNA samples and dental records, and for the families the wait was agonising.EPAMourners gathered around a shrine of flowers and candlesThe bar was packed full of young people that night, many of them just teenagers. The drinking age in Switzerland is 16.Some of the survivors joined a silent procession after the Sunday Mass from the church towards the bar itself. Above, in the stunningly beautiful Swiss Alps, cable cars went on sliding up the mountain carrying tourists to ski.The site of the fire is still screened off behind white plastic sheets, but in front of it are heaps of flowers and soft toys at a shrine that keeps growing.Among the bouquets, there are handwritten notes with names and photographs.At one point, the crowd burst into applause: a large group of firefighters and rescue workers in uniform had reached the memorial and stood arm in arm, sobbing for those they couldn't save.For the people of Crans, they are heroes.The local fire commander - who considered leaving his job after what he experienced here - told us he and his colleagues were now a giant family.\"I need them, and they need me,\" David Vocat said, very tearful. \"All my thoughts are for the victims and their families. I am so sorry.\"We've spoken to teenagers who saw people running from the burning bar and describe horrific scenes they say they can never forget.SUPPLIEDVideo from inside the bar appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fireA criminal investigation has now been opened. The bar owners, a French couple, are suspected of killing and causing arson and bodily harm through negligence.Police and prosecutors have been examining images filmed inside Le Constellation that show the moment the fire started, with bar staff carried on others' shoulders, delivering champagne bottles with sparklers attached.The sparks appear to set fire to the ceiling, which was covered with foam for soundproofing, and the flames spread very quickly.Investigators will examine whether the foam and other materials met safety standards.They will look into possible overcrowding, access to emergency exits from the basement and whether there were fire extinguishers.Some videos show teenagers trying, hopelessly, to put the fire out with their T-shirts. Initially, many didn't realise the immense danger and went on dancing and even filming the fire, instead of fleeing.EPATeenagers have described horrific scenes they say they can never forgetOn Sunday, a group of men - some with their faces covered in black scarves - formed a semi-circle to remember a bouncer at the club, who they called Stefi.\"We're here for our colleague,\" one of them said, struggling to speak. \"Stefi has taken his final path. May he now rest in peace.\"\"It was important to be here, with the families. We can't change things, we can only be here,\" Diana said, after praying hand-in-hand with two other women for a group of friends who are still in hospital.\"We only hope they make it.\"\"We are not angry,\" Diana told me. \"But we believe the police will do their work well and we hope there is justice.\"",

    "body": "South Korea's 'movie of the year' is an indie story about a teen's trauma  6 hours agoJuna Moon,BBC Korean, SeoulandFan Wang,BBC News, SingaporeWatch: Yoon Ga-eun talks to the BBC about her film, The World of LoveYoon Ga-eun was not a name many would have recognised in South Korea.That is until her movie about a teenager who is a survivor of sexual violence became a dark-horse hit.\"It hasn't really sunk in yet,\" indie filmmaker Ms Yoon told BBC Korean at a studio in Seoul in late November. \"Now I just feel almost blank - just grateful, and also a bit scared.\"The World of Love has been dubbed the \"movie of the year\" by Korean media for its touching, empathetic portrayal of life after trauma. Instead of recreating the crime, the movie tells the story of what comes after: the everyday life of high-schooler Joo-in, from  school to romance to family and friendships, and all the moments of conflict and joy that go along with it.It has earned the praise of critics and audiences, and more than $1.1m in box office revenue since its debut in October. Viewers have given it a 9 out of 10 on South Korea's largest search portal, Naver.\"Simply a masterpiece,\" is how Bong Jun-ho, director of the globally acclaimed film Parasite and the first Korean to win an Oscar, described it. He called himself the \"head of the Seoul branch of Yoon Ga-eun's fan club\".The film has resonated in a deeply patriarchal country, where women say they fight hard just to be heard. And its surprising success is a sign of the growing willingness to engage in conversations about sexual violence and how survivors are treated.'That's not all I am'The World of Love may not seem like an obvious choice for movie-goers.The Korean title, \"Joo-in of the World\", says little about the plot. While it stars Parasite actor Jang Hye-jin and K-drama star Go Min-si, the lead is played by Seo Su-bin, a new face on the big screen.At its heart, this is a story about the the life of 17-year-old Joo-in.Everything is going well for her. She is popular at school, has a devoted boyfriend, and lives with a caring mum and adorable younger brother.Getty ImagesSeo Su-bin (left) debuts in the film's lead role as high-schooler Joo-inTension begins over her refusal to sign a petition at school. A man who assaulted a 10-year-old child is about to be released from jail into her neighbourhood. So a  fellow student starts a petition calling for the suspension of his release. Joo-in is the only one who refuses to sign.She objects to a single line in the petition: \"Sexual violence leaves deep wounds that never heal and completely destroys a person's life and soul.\"\"I can't agree with this statement,\" Joo-in tells the student who drafted it.The standoff ends up revealing her secret: she was raped by a relative when she was  younger.Despite the harrowing theme, Ms Yoon is determined to explore the fullness of Joo-in's life, whose name means \"owner\" or \"master\" in Korean, alluding to the autonomy Ms Yoon envisioned for her character.Journalists who attended the media screening received a hand-written letter from Ms Yoon asking them to avoid mentioning sexual violence while covering the film.\"The story is more about how we look at her,\" Ms Yoon explained to the BBC, adding that she didn't want to pin a label - childhood sexual abuse survivor - on her protagonist.\"Because Joo-in herself refuses that. It's one part of her identity and it shakes her, but she insists, 'That's not all I am'.\"When she decided to make a film about sexual violence, Ms Yoon was clear about one thing. She did not want it to be predictable.During her research, she said she \"watched pretty much everything that was out there\" on this subject. She spoke with survivors and consulted activists. Those conversations shattered the \"prejudice\" she carried, an ignorance that \"reduces a person entirely to their wound\".\"We spent so much time talking about completely ordinary concerns,\" she said. \"Worries about work, family, friendships and romances, about needing to lose weight or gain weight or exercise more. I think those moments dissolved even that last tiny bit of prejudice I still had.\"Barunson E&AThe World of Love is South Korea's highest-grossing indie film of 2025This touched audiences.Those who liked the film say it challenges the stereotypes we project onto survivors of sexual crimes, encouraging audiences to see them differently - people who are part of society and trying to live their lives like everyone else.When Seo Jinwon, a children's book editor watched the film in Seoul, she said, the cinema \"fell completely silent\" as the film ended. \"No-one rushed to leave. I stayed and watched the end credits. I walked out of the cinema thinking, 'I want to be a good adult who can stand beside all the children and teenagers who are trying so hard to grow up'.\"A sexual violence survivor who wished to remain anonoymous said she had an urge to \"stretch my arms and cheer\" when she walked out of the cinema. \"Joo-in gave me so much. At the end, it felt like she was smiling at me and saying, 'I am living well, so let's keep living well together'.\"The right momentThe World of Love is doing what activists have long worked towards, according to Cho Eunhee, director of Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center who worked as a consultant on the film. The timing, she added, \"is incredibly right\". AFP via Getty ImagesSouth Korean women at a demonstration on International Women's Day in 2018 After the 2017–2018 MeToo movement, it became easier for survivors to share their stories, and the country grew more protective and understanding towards them. By 2025, when Ms Yoon's film was released, \"people were more prepared to empathise with a story like this,\" Ms Cho said. She wonders if, even a few years earlier, the film would have \"found this level of public understanding\".While the MeToo movement sparked conversations about harassment and assaults in workplaces and outside the home, exposing abuse within families, she said, is still widely seen as \"spitting in one's own face\" - but this movie has made more room to talk about it.  The World of Love is not without its critics. Some viewers, including survivors, said it felt unrepresentative of their reality because it downplayed the fear and lasting damage of abuse, portraying families as more supportive than they often were.But criticism does not overshadow the film's value, critic Min Youngjun said, adding that The World of Love has created a healthy space for talking about sexual violence and its victims.  \"The mark of a good film is not how many people liked it versus didn't like it. What matters is whether it creates a space in which we can talk to each other about what it has put on the table.\"",

    "body": "Ecuadorean soldiers jailed for 34 years over boys' forced disappearance14 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterJONATHAN MIRANDA/EPA/ShutterstockEleven Ecuadorean soldiers have been sentenced to 34 years in prison each after being found guilty of the forced disappearance of four boys last year.The discovery of the beaten and burned remains of the four boys, aged between 11 and 15, shocked the violence-wracked nation.The court found a military patrol had picked up the boys as they returned from playing football in the city of Guayaquil, forced them to strip off their clothes, beat them and left them naked in a desolate, dangerous and abandoned location.One of the boys called his father but, by the time he arrived, they were no longer there. Their burned bodies were found days later close to a military base near Guayaquil. In total, 17 soldiers were on trial over the disappearance of 15-year-old Nehemías Arboleda, 11-year-old Steven Medina, and brothers Ismael, 15, and Josué Arroyo, 14.Eleven of the soldiers were sentenced to 34 years and eight months in prison and five were given reduced sentences of two and a half years for co-operating with the prosecution.A lieutenant-colonel who had not been on patrol with the rest of the group was declared not guilty. The soldiers had been sent on patrol as part of the government's crackdown on criminal gangs in the country, which has seen its crime rate skyrocket as the gangs' power has expanded. Defence officials had originally said that the four children, who became known as The Malvinas Four after the neighbourhood the were from, had been stopped by the patrol because they were suspects in a robbery.But the judge ruled that they had been \"innocent victims of a state crime\" and ordered that their families be issued with an official apology and that the four victims be commemorated with a plaque.He also ordered that military personnel undergo human rights training.The judge said that evidence provided by the five soldiers who had co-operated with the prosecution had revealed the cruelty with which the 16 soldiers on patrol had acted. He said that they had deliberately taken the four boys to a desolate area, where they subjected them to racist insults, beatings and even a simulated execution.Defence lawyers had argued that because the boys were alive when the soldiers left, the accused were not responsible for their death.But the judge concluded that leaving them in such a dangerous and desolate location \"was the cause of the victims' death\". It is not known who burned the bodies.",

    "body": "16 hours agoEmily AtkinsonGetty ImagesA senior staff member at France's presidential palace will stand trial over the alleged theft of precious tableware, including Baccarat Champagne glasses and Sèvres porcelain plates. Around 100 objects that were reported missing from the presidential collection were allegedly later found in the locker, car and home of Thomas M, who is reported to be the Élysée Palace's chief butler. He will stand trial alongside two others. Investigators say they found some of the items - thought to be worth between €15,000 and €40,000 (£13,000 and £35,000) - on his Vinted account. It comes just months after the Louvre Museum in Paris suffered a brazen heist in which jewels worth €88m (£76m) were taken. French media reported that Thomas M's role as head butler and keeper of precious silver involved setting the tables at state dinners and other prestigious events.He is accused of siphoning off the items over several months and falsifying the records to cover his tracks.Also among the alleged stolen goods are solid silver cutlery and a René Lalique figurine.The inventory kept by Thomas M suggested he was planning to steal more goods, prosecutors say.The Élysée has already posted a job advertisement to find his replacement, according to French media outlet TF1 Info. Officials at Sèvres - France's state-owned porcelain factory - also identified some of their items on online auction sites, including a plate embossed with an air force stamp and ashtrays.Thomas M was arrested on Tuesday 16 December on suspicion of theft, alongside his partner Damien G - a collector and manager of an online auction company.A third man, Ghislain M, was arrested a day later, accused of receiving stolen goods. His \"passion\" for rare antiques has been put forward by his lawyer as being behind his alleged involvement.According to Le Parisien - which first reported on the case - he was working as a guard at the Louvre at the time and has been barred from returning until the trial is completed.The trial is scheduled for February.More on this story",

    "body": "17 hours agoAlex BoydandLaura GozziBBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg on scene of Moscow car bombingA Russian general has been killed in a car bombing in Moscow, officials have said.Russia's Investigative Committee said Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died on Monday morning after an explosive device planted under a car detonated.He is the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department, the committee said.It added one theory being investigated was that the bomb was planted with the involvement of Ukrainian intelligence services. Ukraine has not commented.Sarvarov died in hospital as a result of his injuries, the committee said, adding it had opened an investigation into murder and illegal trafficking of explosives.Investigators have been sent to the scene, in a car park near an apartment block in the south of Moscow.Images from the area show a badly damaged white Kia Sorento with the doors blown out, surrounded by other vehicles. According to Russian media, Sarvarov previously took part in combat operations during the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the Chechen wars in the 1990s and early 2000s, and also led operations in Syria between 2015-2016. ReutersInvestigators could be seen working at the scene on Monday morningVladimir Putin was informed of Sarvarov's death immediately, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of military officials and high-profile individuals have been targeted in the Russian capital.Darya Dugina, the 29-year-old daughter of a prominent nationalist figure and Putin close ally, was killed in a suspected car bombing in 2022.Gen Yaroslav Moskalik was killed in a car bomb attack last April, while Gen Igor Kirillov died in December 2024 when a device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely.A Ukrainian source later told the BBC that Kirillov was killed by Ukraine's security service, though this was never confirmed on the record. As a matter of policy, Ukraine never officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks.",

    "body": "Spain's Christmas lottery has been welcomed as an \"injection of hope\" in the northwest of the country, where the jackpot handed out hundreds of millions of euros just months after wildfires had caused devastation.Most of the first-prize-winning tickets in the lottery, known as El Gordo, had been bought by people in small towns in the province of León. A single ticket, or décimo, costing €20 (£17), is worth €400,000 (£349,484) if it bears the winning number, in this case 79432. Décimos come in strips of 10 and when many strips of the same number are sold to a group of neighbours or workmates, there is potential for a massive jackpot.People in the town of La Bañeza shared out €468m (£409m). Among the recipients were members of a local football club in the town, which has a population of around 11,000.The jackpot came four months after forest fires had torn through León, burning 8,000 hectares (31 sq miles) of land surrounding La Bañeza and killing a local man, 35-year-old Abel Ramos. The sparsely populated, heavily forested north-west of Spain is used to wildfires, although during this record-breaking year, the area was particularly severely affected. Firefighters battled enormous blazes in León and the neighbouring Galicia region throughout much of August and during the summer 0.8 percent of the country's total surface area was burned.According to the mayor of the town, Javier Carrera, the lottery win \"means for La Bañeza an injection of excitement and hope,\" he told Spanish media. Carrera also mentioned the closure this year of a local sugar-beet factory which caused the loss of dozens of jobs.Another town in the León province that was heavily affected by the summer's fires, Villablino, also took a massive share of the jackpot, receiving €200 million (£175m).\"We needed some good news,\" said the mayor, Mario Rivas.On top of the blazes, five local men were killed in two separate mining accidents in nearby Asturias this year.\"It doesn't make up for the loss of the lives of our friends, but this shows us that there can also be good news,\" said Rivas.Most of the winning tickets in Villablino were sold by a local Alzheimer's association.In addition, the town of La Pola de Gordón, also in León and with a population of 3,000, shared out 60 million euros. Sixty-four million euros of jackpot money also went to a working-class district in Madrid.In Villablino, Maribel Martín had one of the winning décimos, worth €400,000 (£349,484). She was out doing grocery shopping when her son called her to give her the good news.\"We were really down and 200 million euros is a wonderful thing,\" she saidShe is clear what she wants to do with the prize money. \"Spread it around a bit and enjoy life,\" she said.",

    "body": "1 day agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThe Fulham midfielder will represent his home country Nigeria in the competitionHe's played on some of the biggest stages in the world in the Premier League, but Alex Iwobi believes the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) is a \"special\" experience. The tournament will see 24 teams battling for the continental crown across the next couple of weeks. Fulham midfielder Iwobi will represent his home country of Nigeria in the competition, where they will be hoping to clinch the title after missing out in a 2-1 loss to Ivory Coast in 2023's final.\"With Afcon, you get to celebrate Africa through football,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. \"You get to see different cultures, you get to see how different people dress, how people from Nigeria, the way we walk into the changing rooms.\"When some of the other countries walk into the changing rooms, we play music, so we're celebrating our music through that as well.\"Nigeria will be hoping to redeem themselves after failing to qualify for a second successive World Cup. Iwobi says it was a \"big disappointment\", but the team will be using it to fuel them in the Afcon tournament.\"We owe it to ourselves to make it right, and there's no better way from the last Afcon to improve (than) just to win this one,\" the 29-year-old says. This year's Afcon is being held in Morocco.Nigeria have won the competition three times over the years, the last being back in 2013. Their most recent loss to Ivory Coast is still prominent in Iwobi's mind as he says it \"shattered\" their dreams. However, he feels the moment was \"written\" for striker Sébastien Haller, who scored the winning goal after overcoming testicular cancer. \"It was a tough loss, but you give credit when credit due, they deserved it,\" Iwobi says.\"But it's also fuelled us and we've been working hard to get into the Afcon again and, hopefully, this is our story.\"Getty ImagesAlex Iwobi made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015The Fulham midfielder was born in Lagos, but moved to London as a child. His talent was spotted early and he was selected to represent England up to under-18 level.After many years with the Three Lions, he made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015 as he says he felt more \"at home\" with the team.\"England treated me with a lot of respect and they loved me,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I felt more of a connection with my roots in Nigeria.\"He has since made 91 appearances, making him the fourth most capped player for the Nigerian Super Eagles. Iwobi says he never thought he would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria growing up, but he is \"honoured and grateful\" for his achievements. Ademola Lookman, Calvin Bassey and Iwobi's school friend Ola Aina are also among the players on the Nigerian national team who were not raised in the country.They have been affectionately nicknamed the \"innit boys\", and Iwobi hopes they have helped open the door for others to represent their home country. \"You're Nigerian at the end of the day and you will get loved regardless,\" he says.Getty ImagesIwobi says he never thought we would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria in his careerThere has been debate over whether Afcon gets the respect it deserves.Earlier this year, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher caused a stir when he suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\", when discussing Mohamed Salah's chances of winning the coveted Ballon d'Or.Iwobi feels there is still more work to be done.\"It's obviously getting recognised a lot more,\" he says. \"There's a lot of great talents, great nations representing.\"In the Premier League there's a lot of players in each team that are going to be represented so the awareness is growing, but it definitely deserves a lot more respect, in my opinion.\"If he wins the tournament, the Fulham player says he will be on the phone to his parents and sister straight away, while his extended family will be dancing.\"I've heard from previous people that when they win it, it's like everything just stops, you become like a king, you're just royalty,\" he says. \"Just going to the final we got treated like royalty anyway, so I can't imagine winning it.\"It would just be crazy, but I want to experience that.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "7 hours agoKwasi AsieduandOsmond ChiaThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy, according to pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.It is the first pill of its kind to receive approval from the regulator, marking a new era for weight-loss drugs.Wegovy's Danish makers Novo Nordisk said the once-daily pill was a \"convenient option\" to the injectable and would provide the same weight loss as the shot. It comes after Wegovy was approved by the FDA specifically for weight loss.Others like Ozempic, which has similar weight-loss effects, were primarily approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.The BBC has contacted the FDA for comment.The Wegovy pill showed an average weight loss of 16.6% during Novo Nordisk's trials, the firm said on Monday.A third of around 1,300 participants experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the same trial, it added.The pill is expected to be launched in the US in early January 2026.\"Patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy injection,\" said Mike Doustdar, the firm's chief executive.The pill version of Wegovy could give Novo Nordisk's sales a boost after a challenging year which saw its shares slide as it warned over its profits.The company has faced intense competition in the weight-loss market from rival drugmakers like Eli Lilly.Novo Nordisk's shares rose by almost 10% in after-hours trade in New York after the announcement.",

    "body": "Vince Zampella, who co-created the widely popular video game series Call of Duty, has died in a car crash in California, aged 55. Zampella's death was confirmed by Electronic Arts, which owns Respawn Entertainment, a game studio he co-founded.The influential video game developer was travelling in a Ferrari with another person, when it crashed and caught fire on a highway in Los Angeles on Sunday. \"This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince's family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,\" a spokesperson for Electronic Arts told the  BBC.Officials said the person on the vehicle's passenger seat was ejected while the driver remained trapped. It is unclear if Zampella was driving the car and who the other person inside was. Both people inside the vehicle died. \"For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed,\" the California Highway Patrol said in a statement to the BBC. Zampella created Call of Duty with his long time collaborators Jason West and Grant Collier in 2003. Partly inspired by events in World War II, the game has sold more than 500 million copies making owners Microsoft's Activision one of the most profitable gaming companies. It has also spawned an upcoming live-action film.The Call of Duty franchise was not his only success. He was also behind other widely popular games including the Medal of Honor, Titanfall and Apex Legend.\"He really cared about the player experience, he cared about making games, he cared about how people felt when they played and that really came across whenever you spoke to him,\" Keza MacDonald, the Guardian's video games editor told BBC Newshour.In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which publishes the Call of Duty games, and the pair were subsequently locked in a long dispute with the company which they settled out of court in 2012.At Electronic Arts, Zampella worked on Battlefield 6, which is seen as a direct competitor to Call of Duty.Infinity Ward, the American company that developed Call of Duty, said Zampella \"will always have a special place in our history\".\"Your legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment is immeasurable,\" the company said in a statement on X.",

    "body": "US and Ukrainian envoys said talks in Miami aimed at ending the war with Russia had been \"productive and constructive\" - but no major breakthrough that could bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to peace seems forthcoming.US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, issued a joint statement with the top Ukrainian negotiator, Rustem Umerov, after three days of talks alongside European officials.The pair said the meeting focused on aligning positions on a 20-point plan, a \"multilateral security guarantee framework\", a \"US security guarantee framework for Ukraine\" and an \"economic & prosperity plan\". Separate talks also took place in Miami between the US and the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.\"Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine's recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity,\" Witkoff and Umerov said in a statement.The meetings are the latest step in weeks of diplomatic activity, sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan last month. That plan shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.Witkoff said representatives from Russia had met himself and other US officials in southern Florida, including Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.The meetings with Russian envoy Dmitriev were also \"productive and constructive\", Witkoff said, adding that \"Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine\". On Monday the Kremlin said Dmitriev would travel back to Moscow to debrief Vladimir Putin on US proposals for a potential settlement. Suggestions that a three-way meeting between the US, Russia and Ukraine could be on the cards were brushed off by Moscow. Trump has been pushing Ukraine and Russia to come to an agreement on ending the war, but so far the two countries have been unable to agree on major issues, including Moscow's demand to be handed sections of the Donbas regions it has not managed to seize militarily.US intelligence reports continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin still wants to capture all of Ukraine and reclaim parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire, six sources familiar with US intelligence told the Reuters news agency. \"This absolutely does not correspond to reality,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday. The comments came after Putin told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that there will be no more wars after Ukraine, if Russia is treated with respect.\"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours,\" he said.Russia has recently intensified its attacks on Ukraine's southern region of Odesa. Ukrainian officials have said the strikes - which on Sunday night hit port and energy infrastructure - were aiming to limit Ukraine's access to the Black Sea and disrupt critical logistics routes to the border with Moldova.Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack damaged two vessels and two piers in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russian officials said on Monday. The damage led to a big fire, but Russian authorities say all crew were safely evacuated.  Some reports say oil infrastructure was targeted.",

    "body": "'A miracle': Officer shot in head during Bondi attack home from hospital2 hours agoYang TianSydneyPA MediaJack Hibbert had been working as a police officer for just months before he was shotA young police officer who was shot in the head during the Bondi Beach attack has been released from hospital.Probationary Constable Jack Hibbert - who is just four months into the job - was patrolling a Hanukkah event when two gunmen opened fire, injuring over 40 people and killing 15.The 22-year-old, who was also hit in the shoulder, has lost vision in one of his eyes but is now recovering at home, his family confirmed in a statement.\"As a family, we couldn't ask for anything more - having our Jack home, especially for Christmas, truly feels like a miracle.\"They thanked the public for their \"overwhelming support\" and praised medical staff for their \"exceptional\" care and dedication.\"While he is home, he is still recovering and will need space, support, and continued positive thoughts during this time,\" the statement added.Even after he was shot during the attack, Constable Hibbert continued to help festival attendees until he physically couldn't, his family previously said.\"Many of his colleagues who were present on the night of the incident have visited in hospital and given testaments to Jack's bravery during the incident... They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger,\" they said.He was one of two police officers injured in the shooting, with the second officer Constable Scott Dyson, 25, still recovering from his injuries in hospital, according to the last police update.Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon visited Constable Hibbert in hospital, praising him as a \"positive young man\".Lanyon added that the force would rally around Constable Hibbert and find \"appropriate duties for him\" after his recovery.Police have alleged the suspected gunmen were inspired by Islamic State ideology and targeted the Jewish festival in what has been declared a terror attack.Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.On Monday, new court documents alleged the pair \"meticulously\" planned the attack for months, and two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA top Amazon executive has said the US technology giant has blocked more than 1,800 job applications from suspected North Korean agents.North Koreans tried to apply for remote working IT jobs using stolen or fake identities, Amazon's chief security officer Stephen Schmidt said in a LinkedIn post.\"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" he said, adding that this trend is likely to be happening at scale across the industry, especially in the US.Authorities in the US and South Korea have warned about Pyongyang's operatives carrying out online scams.Amazon has seen a nearly one-third increase in job applications from North Koreans in the past year, said Mr Schmidt in his post.He said the operatives typically work with people managing \"laptop farms\"  - referring to computers based in the US that are run remotely from outside of the country.The firm used a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and verification by its staff to screen job applications, he said.The strategies used by such fraudsters have become more sophisticated, Mr Schmidt said.Bad actors are hijacking dormant LinkedIn accounts using leaked credentials to gain verification. They target genuine software engineers to appear credible, he said, urging firms to report suspicious job applications to the authorities.Mr Schmidt warned employers to look out for indicators of fraudulent North Korean job applications, including incorrectly formatted phone numbers and mismatched education histories.In June, the US government said it had uncovered 29 \"laptop farms\" that were being operated illegally across the country by North Korean IT workers.They used stolen or forged identities of Americans to help North Korean nationals get jobs in the US, said the Department of Justice (DOJ).It also indicted US brokers who had helped secure jobs for the North Korean operatives.In July, a woman from Arizona was sentenced to more than eight years in jail for running a laptop farm to help North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at more than 300 US companies.The DOJ said the scheme generated more than $17m (£12.6m) in illicit gains for her and Pyongyang.",

    "body": "18 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterThe gold price has hit another record high, trading above $4,400 (£3,275) an ounce for the first time.The price of the precious metal has risen on expectations the US central bank will cut interest rates further next year, analysts said.Gold started the year worth $2,600 an ounce, but geopolitical tensions, the Trump tariffs and expectations of rate cuts have added to investor demand for safe haven assets, such as gold and other commodities.The prices of other precious metals also rose on Monday, with silver hitting a record high as well.The gold price has risen more than 68% this year, the highest increase since 1979, according to Adrian Ash, director of research at gold bullion marketplace BullionVault.2025 has seen \"slow-burning trends around interest rates, around war and trade tensions\", Mr Ash said, which have helped to push up the price of gold.\"The precious metals market says that President Trump has really triggered something – and gold has gone crazy this year.\"You've got the trade war, the attacks on the US Federal Reserve and you've got geopolitical tensions, all of those provocations come from Trump,\" he said.After passing the $4,400 an ounce mark on Monday, the spot price of gold hit a high of $4,426.66.Lower interest rate expectations typically mean lower returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to commodities such as gold and silver to get a return, but also diversify their portfolios.The consensus among analysts currently is that the US will lower interest rates twice in 2026.Another factor adding to demand is that central banks globally are expanding their own physical holdings of gold as a way to counter economic turbulence, reduce reliance on the US dollar, and diversify their own portfolios, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs, which predicted the pattern would continue in 2026.The steady increase in the price of gold across the year could be because it is seen as a way for traders to help shield themselves from the threat of inflation and economic turmoil, Anita Wright, chartered financial planner at Ribble Wealth Management, said.\"When confidence in financial assets and policy stability starts to wobble, gold tends to respond first as the primary monetary metal,\" Ms Wright said.A weaker US dollar has also helped push gold prices higher by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.Other precious metals have also had record years. The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday.For 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts. Unlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand.Separately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.The price of Brent crude rose $1.31 to $61.78 a barrel, while US oil was up $1.25 at $57.77. However, both measures look set to end 2025 at prices lower than where they started the year.",

    "body": "Civil rights groups and pro-gun advocates in Australia have raised concerns that new fast-tracked laws will place undue restrictions on firearms and protests in the wake of the Bondi shootings.On Monday, the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) recalled its parliament to debate a raft of new laws such as banning the phrase \"globalise the intifada\", limiting the number of guns one person can own, and greater police powers for protests.NSW Premier Chris Minns said some may feel the changes had \"gone too far\" but they were needed to keep the community safe.A pro-gun politician said the laws unfairly target law-abiding gun owners while civil libertarians said restrictions on protests were an affront to democracy.On banning the \"intifada\" phrase, Minns said its use at protests in Australia and around the world \"are a call to a global intifada. That is what it means. Not in the Middle East, not in Israel or Gaza but here in Sydney\".\"I do believe it leads to a culture and environment of heightened disunity,\" he said, and \"an invitation to violence\".The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.In the aftermath of the Bondi attacks, in which 15 people were killed, the Jewish community accused the government of not doing enough to protect it from rising antisemitism.The new protest laws will also allow police to restrict demonstrations at places of worship, with stronger penalties for breaches.Timothy Roberts, president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, said the new law ignores a recent decision by the state's supreme court which found the so-called \"move-on power\" at religious locations went against Australia's implied constitutional freedom of political communication.Religious institutions exercise significant and overt political power in Australian politics and this makes them a legitimate site of protest in a democratic society, Mr Roberts said. \"The laws introduced today are an affront to our right to assemble and communicate with each other,\" he said, adding they \"damage our democracy\".He said Minns wants social cohesion but he does not know the meaning of the term. \"He thinks silence is peace, and does not seem to realise it can also reflect oppression. Passing laws that oppress some parts of our community in the wake of an attack like we saw, does not bring us closer - it drives us further apart and stops us from healing well in this time of grief.\"Police will also be able to remove face coverings from protesters who are suspected of committing an offence - including low-level offences - during a protest. Previously, police could only do so if someone is arrested or suspected of committing an indictable offence. On gun reform, the new laws will mean licence holders in NSW cannot own more than four firearms with exceptions for farmers and sport shooters who can have up to ten. The move follows similar laws introduced in Western Australia earlier this year to cap gun ownership. Elsewhere across the country, there are no limits.One of the gunmen in the Bondi shooting, Sajid Akram, had six registered firearms. Other gun law changes include more regular renewals for gun licence holders from every five years to every two years, and a review of the types of firearms available to most gun owners.Mark Banasiak from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party - which lobbies for more relaxed gun laws - said the state's 260,000 gun licence holders were being \"punished\" and \"made a scapegoat for agency failings\".\"We're diverting away from what the real problem is,\" he said, referring to \"a climate of hate and division that's been allowed to fester for two and a half years because government haven't done enough to stop that.\"Walter Mikac, whose wife and two young daughters were among the 35 people shot dead in Tasmania by a lone gunman in 1996 in what is Australia's deadliest mass shooting, welcomed the reforms.The changes will \"close critical gaps in our gun laws\" and put community safety first, he said. The government also aims to crackdown on hate speech and symbols, as well as enabling police to ban protests for up to three months after a terrorist attack.Palestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees said the new laws were \"incredibly draconian\".\"Australia is seen as a safe country,\" he said, \"where freedom of speech is very important\" but the Bondi shooting was \"perhaps changing the dynamics of that democracy and that freedom\".David Ossip, president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said moves to ban \"intifada\" chants was a \"watershed moment\" in confronting hate and incitement. He also welcomed greater police powers during protests.\"The right to protest is a core Australian value and a fundamental tenet of a democratic society,\" he said.\"But it has never included the right to hide your face and shout slogans calling for violence against one's fellow Australians or waving the flags of groups devoted to murder and destruction.\"Additional reporting by Katy Watson",

    "body": "23 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,JerusalemandMallory MoenchIsrael's security cabinet has approved the recognition of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank as the government continues its settlement expansion push.Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a settler who proposed the move alongside Defence Minister Israel Katz, said the decision was about blocking the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said Israel's \"relentless\" settlement expansion fuels tensions, restricts Palestinian access to land, and threatens the viability of a sovereign Palestinian state. Saudi Arabia and the UK also condemned the move. The announcement risked \"undermining the [US] 20 Point Plan [for ending the Gaza war] and prospects for the long-term peace and security that only a two-state solution can deliver\", said UK foreign office minister Hamish Falconer.Violence in the occupied West Bank has surged since the war in Gaza began following Hamas's deadly attack on Israel in October 2023, further heightening fears that settlement expansion could entrench Israel's occupation and undermine a two-state solution.The two-state solution refers to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Since taking office in 2022, the current Israeli government has significantly increased the approval of new settlements and begun the legalisation process for unauthorised outposts, recognising them as \"neighbourhoods\" of existing settlements.The most recent decision brings the total number of settlements approved over the past three years to 69, according to Smotrich.The approvals come just days after the United Nations said settlement expansion had reached its highest level since 2017. The latest approvals include the re-establishment of two settlements — Ganim and Kadim — which were dismantled nearly 20 years ago.In May, Israel approved 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank - the biggest expansion in decades.The Israeli government also approved plans in August to build more than 3,000 homes in the so-called E1 project between Jerusalem and the Maale Adumim settlement, which had been frozen for decades amid fierce opposition internationally.Smotrich at the time said the plan would \"bury the idea of a Palestinian state\".About 700,000 settlers live in approximately 160 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now. It is land Palestinians seek for a future independent state.Settlement expansion has angered Arab nations who have consistently said it undermines prospects for a two-state solution. It has also raised concerns about the possible annexing of the occupied West Bank.US President Donald Trump had warned Israel about such a move, telling TIME magazine that Israel would lose all its support from the US if it happened.In September, the UK - along with other countries including Australia and Canada - recognised a Palestinian state, a significant although symbolic change in government policy.Israel opposed the move, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying a Palestinian state \"will not happen\".",

    "body": "Officials from Thailand and Cambodia will meet next week to discuss the possibility of reviving a ceasefire, Thailand's foreign minister said, as deadly border clashes entered a third week. Both countries had signed a ceasefire earlier in July, brokered by US President Donald Trump. But fighting broke out again earlier this month - which both countries have blamed each other for. On Monday, top officials from both countries met at a summit in Malaysia, their first first face-to-face meeting since fighting resumed.Speaking afterwards, Thailand's Foreign Minister said the July ceasefire was \"rushed\", saying it was because the US \"wanted the declaration signed in time for Trump's [visit]\".\"We were sometimes in a rush because the US wanted it signed by the visit of President Trump,\" said Sihasak Phuangketkeow.\"But sometimes we really just [need to] sit down, trash things [out]...  make sure that the ceasefire reflects... the situation on the ground. And the ceasefire is one that really holds.\"Mr Phuangketkeow said a meeting between military officials from both Thailand and Cambodia would take place on 24 December, and that this would need to happen before any ceasefire agreement could be reached. Cambodia has yet to comment on the matter. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the renewed fighting this month. Both countries have blamed each other for the fresh hostilities. The most recent fighting has seen the exchange of artillery fire along the 800km (500-mile) border. Thailand has also launched air strikes targetting Cambodian positions.At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) meeting on Monday, Malaysia's foreign minister had asked both sides and other Asean members to give the matter \"our most urgent attention\".\"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation for the people we serve,\" Mohamad Hasan told his counterparts, according to news agency AFP.The conflict has been the worst between Asean member states since the association was founded in 1967. The failure to contain it represents a serious blow to the bloc's credibility.The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.China's special envoy for Asian affairs, Deng Xijun, visited Phnom Penh last week. A statement from Beijing said he reaffirmed that China would continue to play a constructive role in facilitating dialogue between Cambodia and Thailand.On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at the daily press briefing that China had been mediating the confict in its own way since fighting restarted this month. He added that Beijing would release information on the mediation conducted by Deng \"in due course\".The argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years. But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on  24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.The two countries later agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump - who at the time threatened to stop tariff negotiations until the hostilities stopped.The US president later oversaw the signing of what he dubbed \"the Kuala Lumpar peace accord\" in October. Thailand refused to call it that - instead referring to it as \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\".But that ceasefire fell apart in December, with both sides blaming each other for re-igniting the fighting, which has seen air strikes and exchanges of artillery fire.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Thanyarat Doksone",

    "body": "In rebel-held Myanmar, civilians face devastating air strikes and a sham election1 day agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent in MyanmarAamir Peerzada/BBCSome Burmese refugees who fled Chin state are now taking shelter across the border in IndiaLate one night last month Iang Za Kim heard explosions in a neighbouring village, then fighter jets flying overhead. She ran out of her home to see smoke rising from a distance.\"We were terrified. We thought the junta's planes would bomb us too. So we grabbed what we could – some food and clothes and ran into the jungles surrounding our village.\"Iang's face quivers as she recounts the story of what happened on 26 November in K-Haimual, her village in Myanmar's western Chin State, and then she breaks down.She's among thousands of civilians who've fled their homes in recent weeks after the Burmese military launched a fierce campaign of air strikes, and a ground offensive in rebel-held areas across the country, to recapture territory ahead of elections starting on 28 December.Four other women sitting around her on straw mats also start crying. The trauma of what they've gone through to make it to safety is clearly visible.While the air strikes were the immediate cause for Iang to flee, she also doesn't want to be forced to participate in the election.\"If we are caught and refuse to vote, they will put us in jail and torture us. We've run away so that we don't have to vote,\" she says.Aamir Peerzada/BBCIang Za Kim had to flee her home after the junta launched air strikes nearbySome from Chin state have described the junta's latest offensive as the fiercest it has launched in more than three years.Many of the displaced have sought refuge in other parts of the state. Iang is among a group that crossed the border into India's Mizoram state. Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.Indian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.Ral Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.\"We're afraid of our own government. They are extremely cruel. Their military has come into our and other villages in the past, they've arrested people, tortured them, and burned down homes,\" he says.It isn't easy to speak to Burmese civilians freely. Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.During its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.The Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.The BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October. Two students –Johan Phun Lian Cung, who was seven, and Zing Cer Mawi, 12 - were killed as they were attending lessons. The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.Myanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.This is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family – a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village. Now they're homeless again.\"I can't find the words to explain how painful and hard it is and what a difficult decision it was to make to leave. But we had to do it to stay alive,\" he says.\"I want the world to know that what the military is claiming – that this election is free and fair – this is absolutely false. When the main political party is not being allowed to contest the election, how can there be genuine democracy?\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCBawi Nei Lian (left) says the scheduled elections are a shamThe National League for Democracy party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, will not be contesting as most of its senior leaders including  Suu Kyi are in jail.\"We don't want the election. Because the military does not know how to govern our country. They only work for the benefit of their high-ranking leaders. When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's party was in power, we experienced a bit of democracy. But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.Iang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"The election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January. Rebel groups have called it a sham.At the base of the Chin National Front in Myanmar, the most prominent rebel group operating in the state, the group's Vice Chairman Sui Khar says: \"This election is only being held to prolong military dictatorship. It's not about the people's choice. And in Chin State, they hardly control much area, so how can they hold an election?\"He points out the areas where the most intense fighting is ongoing on a map and tells us nearly 50 rebel fighters have been injured in just the past month. There have been deaths too, but so far the groups have not released a number.\"There are columns of hundreds of soldiers trying to advance into the northern part of Chin state from four directions,\" Sui Khar says. \"The soldiers are being supported by air strikes, artillery fire and by drone units.\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCAbel lost his right leg and his hands were severely wounded fighting against the juntaAccess to the base is extremely rare. Set amid thickly forested mountains, it is the heart of the resistance against the junta in Chin state.Sui Khar takes us to the hospital at the base. We see a group of injured fighters who were brought in overnight and had to undergo hours of surgery. Some of them have had to undergo amputations.Many of them were just schoolboys when the coup occurred in 2021. Just about adults now, they've let go of their dreams to fight on the frontline against the junta.Abel, 18, is in too much pain to speak. He was with a group of fighters trying to take back territory the junta captured a week ago. They won the battle, but Abel lost his right leg and has serious injuries to his hands as well.In a bed next to him is Si Si Maung, 19, who's also had a leg amputated.\"As the enemy was retreating we ran forward and I stepped on a landmine. We were injured in the explosion. Then we were attacked from the air. The airstrikes make things very difficult for us,\" he says. \"I've lost a leg, but even if I've to give up my life I'm happy to make the sacrifice so that future generations have a better life.\"The impact of the ferocity of the latest offensive is visible in room after room at the hospital.Yet, it's the support and grit of tens of thousands of youngsters like Si Si Maung, who picked up arms to fight against the junta, that have helped the rebels make rapid advances against a much more powerful rival in the past four-and-a-half years.Some like 80-year-old Ral Uk Thang hope that after the election, the junta will retreat, and he will be able to go back home.\"But I don't think I will live to see democracy restored in Myanmar,\" he says. \"I hope my children and grandchildren can witness it some day.\"Additional reporting by Aamir Peerzada, Sanjay Ganguly and Aakriti Thapar",

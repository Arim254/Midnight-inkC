    "body": "Diane Ladd, three-time Academy Award nominee and star of Wild at Heart, has died aged 89. Her daughter, actress Laura Dern, confirmed her death on Monday. \"My amazing hero and my profound gift of a mother, Diane Ladd, passed with me beside her this morning,\" Dern said in a statement, adding that her final moments were spent at home in California. Dern, who starred with her mother in 1991's Rambling Rose,  did not share Ladd's cause of death.\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her.\" Ladd's career on stage and screen spanned decades. Her big break in film came as a waitress in Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in 1974, which earned her an Oscar nomination.She went on to appear in dozens of films after that, including as recently as 2022, when she played a grandmother in the coming-of-age film Gigi & Nate, and also acted frequently on television shows.She was married to actor Bruce Dern from 1960 to 1969. The couple had two children, Oscar-winner Laura Dern and a baby girl, Diane Elizabeth Dern, who died in an accident in 1962, when she was 18 months old. \"She fell into the pool. She hit her head and knocked herself out. And it all happened instantly. And she died, and you will never get over that,\" Ladd told the BBC's US partner CBS News in 2023. Ladd had a close relationship with Laura, her second child, and they shared the screen many times. When Dern starred in David Lynch's Wild at Heart and later in the HBO series Enlightened, Ladd played her mother both times.They were also the first mother-daughter pair to be nominated for an Academy Award for the same movie, Rambling Rose. Neither won that year.In 2023, they wrote a book together called Honey, Baby, Mine: A Mother and Daughter Talk Life, Death, Love.Ladd told CBS that she originally discouraged Dern from becoming an actress.\"She was only, like, 11 years old, and I said, 'Don't be an actress. Be a doctor, be a lawyer,'\" she said. \"Nobody cares if you put on weight or your chin points when you cry if you're a doctor. They just want you to be the best you can be. But an actress? They care, care, care, care, care.\"Dern says she pushed back. \"No. It is all I knew,\" she said.Paying tribute to the actress, Scorsese said: \"I have so many good memories of making Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, and my experiences with Diane are among the best.\"I felt that it was so important for the picture to let the actors run with their characters, and what an experience it was to watch Diane take the character of Flo and make something so vivid and funny and alive.\"He added: \"Diane was a great improvisational actor - a matter of technique and discipline, but most of all instinct and artistry - and she had it all.\"",

    "body": "19 hours agoMichael Sheils McNamee,Business reporter and Danielle Kaye,Business reporterOpenAI has signed a $38bn (£29bn) contract with Amazon to access its cloud computing infrastructure, as the start-up continues its run of major partnerships to secure computing power. In 2025, the ChatGPT maker has signed deals worth more than $1tn with Oracle, Broadcom, AMD and chip-making giant Nvidia. Its latest deal reduces its reliance on Microsoft.As part of the seven-year agreement, OpenAI will gain access to Nvidia graphics processors to train its artificial intelligence models. The deal follows a sweeping restructure of OpenAI last week which saw it convert away from being a non-profit and changed its relationship with Microsoft to give OpenAI more operational and financial freedom.\"Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,\" said OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman.\"Our partnership with AWS [Amazon Web Services] strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.\"The deal reflects the massive demand for computer power coming from the growing interest in AI - and OpenAI's rush to secure the power it needs.OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, had been reliant on Microsoft for computing power for years. The two firms had an exclusive cloud agreement until January of this year, when their relationship loosened.The AI start-up's first agreement with Amazon's AWS marks its latest shift away from Microsoft toward diversified sources of computing power. \"The deal with AWS shows that OpenAI considers that its path to leadership is paved with getting access to as much computing power as it can get its hands on,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.Microsoft \"taking less of a control stake in the company has allowed relationships with near competitors to OpenAI's funders possible,\" she added.But OpenAI has been unprofitable, as spends big to get ahead in the development of AI technology. Quarterly results from Microsoft last week indicated that OpenAI lost $12bn in just the last quarter.Following the announcement of the deal on Monday, Amazon shares hit an all-time high, adding $140bn (£106bn) to its valuation.AWS is \"uniquely positioned to support OpenAI's vast AI workloads,\" Matt Garman, CEO of AWS, said in a statement.Leading AI firms have been investing in one another, creating a tangled web of deals that has been drawing scrutiny. OpenAI is at the centre of that web.In response to OpenAI's deal spree, there has been some speculation that an AI bubble may be in the offing.Speaking to the BBC last month, Sam Altman said: \"Yes, the investment loans are unprecedented\", but added: \"It's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast.\"Warnings have come from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, as well as from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who told the BBC that \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoKathryn Armstrong and Diwakar Pyakurel & Phanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali in KathmanduGetty ImagesA search and rescue operation continues for the rest of the group, which includes other foreign nationals and local guidesAt least seven climbers, including five foreigners and two Nepalis, have died after being hit by an avalanche on a Himalayan peak in north-eastern Nepal, expedition agency Seven Summit Treks said.The incident happened at 09:00 local time (03:15 GMT) on Monday near the base camp of the Yalung Ri mountain in Dolakha district. Rescuers located two bodies, and are still searching for the remaining five, who are believed to have been buried by snow. Eight others have been rescued and are in the capital Kathmandu getting treatment for their injuries.All these climbers were part of a group that set out over an hour before the avalanche hit, the district police chief told BBC Nepali. The bodies of the other five deceased climbers \"may be 10-15 feet below the snow\", said Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks. \"It will take time to find them.\"Those killed include two Italians, a Canadian, a German, a French, and two Nepalis who served as guides. Local deputy superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the BBC on Monday that a rescue helicopter had landed in the Na Gaun area of Dolakha - a five-hour walk from the Yalung Ri base camp.One of the injured climbers told The Kathmandu Post that they had repeatedly called for help, to no avail. \"Had the rescue arrived on time, more lives could have been saved,\" he told the Nepali newspaper.Mr Mahato told reporters that rescue efforts were hampered by poor weather and logistical issues, which made it hard to fly helicopters nor reach the site on foot.The Kathmandu Post reported that the group were preparing to climb the nearby Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft). They had planned to climb the 5,630m Yalung Ri as part of their acclimatisation schedule.Separately, attempts to rescue two Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale the Panbari mountain in western Nepal are continuing.Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week. The third member of the group, named in media reports as Velter Perlino, 65, has since been rescued.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains. Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas. Two British and one Irish woman were among a group that had to be rescued after being trapped for several days in the western Mustang region. Severe weather also left hundreds of hikers stranded near Mount Everest in October. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoAbhishek DeyBBC News, DelhiA rodent-borne virus led to the death of the only African elephant at the zoo in India's capital Delhi, officials have told the BBC.Shankar, a 29-year-old male, died on 17 September after spending much of his life in isolation. The cause of his death wasn't known at the time.Now, an autopsy has revealed that the elephant tested positive for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Delhi Zoo director Sanjeet Kumar said.EMCV is known to cause fatal inflammation of the heart and sometimes brain fever in mammals. The virus is spread through rodent faeces and urine.Most outbreaks of EMCV have been associated with captive animals in pig farms, primate research centres and zoos, according to the MSD veterinary manual.The virus replicates rapidly and can attack the heart and sometimes the brain, often causing sudden death. There is no specific antiviral cure available for EMCV so far.According to a 2012 study in the peer-reviewed medical journal Virulence, EMCV has been documented around the world in pigs, rodents, big cats and African elephants, among other mammals.The virus, according to a report in Nature, was first isolated in 1945 from a gibbon in Florida.Since the 1970s, local outbreaks have been reported in the US, South Africa, China, Australia, Canada, South America and several countries in Europe. The outbreaks in the US and South Africa particularly affected captive African elephants.In India, the virus was first isolated in the late 1960s. But Shankar's is the first \"recorded\" death caused by EMCV in India, a senior official at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) told the BBC, adding that \"there may have been unreported instances of mammals dying because of EMCV\". Shankar's autopsy was conducted at IVRI.Mr Kumar, the zoo director, did not answer specific questions about how Shankar may have got the infection and whether there was a rodent problem at the zoo. \"It is a rare virus and I am not an expert on it,\" he said.Shankar's death had triggered sadness among animal lovers and activists who had long sought to rehabilitate the lonely animal.He was among two African elephants that arrived in India in 1998 as a diplomatic gift from Zimbabwe to former Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma. But Shankar's companion died in 2001. He was then temporarily lodged with Asian elephants in the zoo, but the plan did not work.In 2012, Shankar was moved to a new enclosure that left him virtually in solitary confinement - despite a 2009 federal ban on keeping elephants alone for more than six months. He remained there until his death.For years, activists had demanded that Shankar be removed from the zoo and rehabilitated in a wildlife sanctuary that houses other African elephants.In 2021, a petition in Delhi's high court sought Shankar's relocation to a sanctuary with other African elephants. Two years later, the court dismissed the petition, directing the petitioner to approach a committee handling transfers of wild animals by zoos.After Shankar's death, there is only one African elephant left in India - an adult male at Mysore Zoo in southern Karnataka state. He has also been living alone for years.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Southern Europe correspondent, Rome and Jake LaphamA worker who was trapped after part of a medieval tower collapsed in the heart of Rome, has died, according to hospital officials.Octav Stroici, 66, was pulled free at 23:00 local time (22:00 GMT), nearly twelve hours after a section of the Torre dei Conti, on the edge of the famous Roman Forum and close to the Colosseum, gave way and trapped him beneath.His heart stopped in the ambulance, and doctors at the hospital he was rushed to were unable to save him. The Romanian foreign ministry said Stroici was a Romanian national, as was another worker among three others pulled from the rubble. Stroici's rescue was initially described as an exceptional feat by firefighters who had worked late into the night. Rescue teams used drones and rubble clearers to try to reach him, despite the risk that the fragile tower could collapse further. He had been conscious and talking to the emergency workers throughout the rescue. His wife was also at the scene.  Romania's foreign ministry sent its condolences to his family and said \"together with them, we held on to hope until the very last moment\".Stroici had been carrying out conservation work on the medieval tower just off Rome's busy Via dei Fori Imperiali and close to the Forum itself, one of this city's busiest tourist sites. This particular building had been empty and abandoned for many years. The Rome Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into the incident. Part of the structure collapsed at about 11:20 on Monday and efforts to rescue Stroici were interrupted when a second section of the 29m (90ft) high tower began crumbling again about 90 minutes later, as bricks rained down, creating a huge cloud of dust.Rome prefect Lamberto Giannini had described it as a \"very complex situation\". After the initial collapse he said firefighters had \"put up some protection\" around the trapped man, so that when the second collapse happened, \"they obviously shielded him\".He added that the rescue was a long operation due to having to \"mitigate... the enormous risks faced by the people trying to carry out the rescue\".One firefighter was taken to hospital with an eye problem, according to Italian reports, but the rest were unharmed, eventually resuming their search for the man.A police chief said there was no imminent danger that the tower would disintegrate. \"My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life beneath the rubble, and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy finds a positive outcome,\" wrote Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on X before the rescue was complete.Another worker, 67-year-old Ottaviano, who was inside at the time of the collapse but escaped from a balcony uninjured, told the AFP news agency: \"It was not safe. I just want to go home.\"Rome's mayor and Italy's culture minister visited the scene. The 13th Century tower was built by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his brother.It is separated from the main visitors' area of the Roman Forum by a road. The streets all around have been taped off by police as a precaution.",

    "body": "2 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterAustralia is to introduce laws requiring streaming platforms to invest a minimum amount of money in homegrown content, the government said on Tuesday.Platforms such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime and any other streamers with over one million subscribers will have to contribute at least 10% of their local expenditure, or 7.5% of revenue, on Australian content.Legislation will be introduced to parliament this week and will apply to drama, documentaries, arts and educational programmes.Arts minister Tony Burke and communications minister Anika Wells said the move would help to protect acting jobs. The streaming services have not yet commented.\"We have Australian content requirements on free-to-air television and pay television, but until now, there has been no guarantee that we could see our own stories on streaming services,\" Burke said.\"Since their introduction in Australia, streaming services have created some extraordinary shows. This obligation will ensure that those stories – our stories – continue to be made.\"According to the Australian Broadcast Corporation, legislation will be introduced to Parliament this week.The broadcaster said that the new content requirements were meant to be in place by July last year but concerns over how they would interact with a free trade agreement with the US led to the plans being put on hold.The government cited difficulty engaging in negotiations with the US while it was holding an election.After President Trump was elected, there was then concern about whether the rules might prompt the US administration to impose retaliatory tariffs against Australia.Now, with the dust settled, and Trump championing his country's friendship with Australia, those rules are now back on the table.While the Australian Writers Guild (AWG) and Screen Producers Australia (SPA) welcomed the news, streamers have yet to comment.Back in 2022, streamers Stan, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and Paramount+ released their Streaming for Australia report, pointing out their cultural and economic contribution to the country's creative economy. However, it was seen by some as a pre-emptive strike against any attempt at future regulation.Recent Australian shows on Netflix include Heartbreak High, Territory and Apple Cider Vinegar.Like many countries, Australia's creative industries have suffered in recent years, in part due to the production slump during the Covid-19 pandemic.In the financial year 2023-24, investment in feature films and television dramas made in Australia fell by nearly 30%, according to Screen Australia, the government's funding body for the screen production industry.",

    "body": "Peru has announced it is breaking off diplomatic relations with Mexico after its government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.Peruvian Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela expressed his \"surprise and deep regret\" after learning Betssy Chávez was being given refuge at the Mexican embassy in Peru.\"Given this unfriendly act... the Peruvian government has decided to sever diplomatic relations with Mexico today,\" Zela said.In response, Mexico's foreign affairs ministry \"rejected Peru's unilateral decision as excessive and disproportionate\".Chávez had been imprisoned in June 2023 over her alleged role in ousted Peruvian president Pedro Castillos's plan to dissolve congress. She was released by a judge on bail in September and had denied the charges against her.Peru also accused Mexico of \"repeated instances in which the current and former presidents of that country have interfered in Peru's internal affairs\".\"The truth is, they have tried to portray the authors of the coup attempt as victims, when in reality, Peruvians live and want to continue living in democracy, as recognised by all countries in the world, with the sole and lonely exception of Mexico,\" Zela added.Prosecutors are seeking a 25-year sentence for Chávez's alleged role in Castillo's plan to dissolve congress.Castillo was arrested in December 2022 on charges of rebellion, after he attempted to dissolve congress and install an emergency government. Hours after the attempt, Castillo was impeached. He has been in preventative custody ever since. Prosecutors are seeking a 34-year jail term for Castillo, who previously said he never took up arms against the state because the military refused his orders.Peru's decision to sever diplomatic ties with Mexico adds to ongoing tensions between the two governments since Castillo's ousting.In 2022, Lima expelled Mexico's ambassador following its decision to grant asylum to Castillo's wife and children following his arrest.A year later, Peru also recalled its ambassador to Mexico after then-president Andrés Manuel López Obrador expressed his support for Castillo, saying he had been \"illegally ousted\".A former primary school teacher, farmer and union activist, Castillo was dubbed Peru's \"first poor president\".With no previous political experience, he took office as a government outsider, vowing to transform Peru's deteriorating economy and support the poor.But Castillo's presidency came to an infamous end after his attempt to seize power was declared unconstitutional, with government officials and the country's armed forces refusing to support him.Casillo's successor, former president Dina Boluarte, was removed from office last month by an overwhelming majority in Peru's congress, after mass protests against political scandals and soaring crime. Congress leader José Jeri was then sworn in as interim president.",

    "body": "9 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterOnline retail giant Shein says it has banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform around the world, after being accused of displaying products with \"a childlike appearance\" on its website.The French consumer watchdog first raised concerns at the weekend over the description and categorisation of the dolls, saying it left \"little doubt as to the child pornography nature of the content.\"The company said on Monday that it had permanently banned \"all seller accounts linked to illegal or non-compliant sex-doll products\" and will tighten controls across its global platform.Shein also said it had temporarily removed its adult products category as a precaution.Every listing and image related to the sex dolls has been removed from its platform, Shein confirmed, adding that it would conduct a thorough review and planned to set stricter controls on sellers.\"The company has also strengthened its keyword blacklist to further prevent attempted circumvention of product listing restrictions by sellers,\" the company said.Executive chairman Donald Tang said: \"The fight against child exploitation is non-negotiable for Shein. These were marketplace listings from third-party sellers - but I take this personally.\"\"We are tracing the source and will take swift, decisive action against those responsible.\"In a statement, the Paris prosecutor's office said it had received reports by France's Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) on Shein as well as online retail platforms Ali Express, Temu and Wish concerning the sale of sex dolls resembling children. The prosecutor's office said it had referred the investigation to the OFMIN, a French agency tasked with preventing violence against minors.The DGCCRF initially raised concerns about the dolls on Saturday.In response, Shein said it had removed the listings for childlike sex dolls as soon as it became aware of the issue and began an investigation over how the products were able to be offered for sales on its platform.France's finance minister threatened to ban the Singapore-based retailer from the country if it continued to sell the products - days before the company was due to open its first permanent outlet in Paris.People were seen protesting outside the BHV department store opposite Paris's city hall, where the Shein outlet is set to open this week.The brand has previously come under scrutiny over the environmental impact of  fast-fashion and the working conditions of the people who make the products sold on the platform.",

    "body": "A Chinese court has sentenced five top members of an infamous Myanmar mafia to death as Beijing continues its crackdown on scam operations in South East Asia.In all 21 Bai family members and associates were convicted of fraud, homicide, injury and other crimes, said a state media report published on the court website.The family is among a handful of mafias that rose to power in the 2000s and transformed the impoverished backwater town of Laukkaing into a lucrative hub of casinos and red-light districts.In recent years they pivoted to scams in which thousands of trafficked workers, many of them Chinese, are trapped, abused and forced to defraud others in criminal operations worth billions.Mafia boss Bai Suocheng and his son Bai Yingcang were among the five men sentenced to death by the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court. Yang Liqiang, Hu Xiaojiang and Chen Guangyi were the other three.Two members of the Bai family mafia were handed suspended death sentences. Five were sentenced to life imprisonment, while nine others were handed jail sentences ranging from three to 20 years.The Bais, who controlled their own militia, established 41 compounds to house their cyberscam activities and casinos, authorities said.These criminal activities involved more than 29 billion Chinese yuan ($4.1bn; £3.1bn). They also led to the deaths of six Chinese citizens, the suicide of one and multiple injuries, state media reported.The harsh penalties handed down by the court are part of China's campaign to eradicate the vast scam networks in South East Asia - and send a stern warning to other criminal syndicates.In September a Chinese court sentenced 11 members of the Ming family - another prominent Laukkaing clan - to death.These families rose to power in the 2000s with the help of Min Aung Hlaing - who now leads Myanmar's military government. He had wanted to prop up allies in Laukkaing after ousting its former warlord.Among the clans, the Bais were \"absolutely number one\", Bai Yingcang previously told state media.\"At that time, our Bai family was the most powerful in both the political and military circles,\" he said in a documentary about the Bai family, aired on Chinese state media in July.In the same documentary, a worker at one of their scam centres recalled the abuse he had endured there: besides being beaten, he had his fingernails yanked out with pliers and two of his fingers severed with a kitchen knife.Bai Yingcang is among those who were sentenced to death this week. He has also been separately convicted of conspiring to traffic and manufacture 11 tonnes of methamphetamine, state media reported.The families' fall came in 2023 as political winds changed.For years Beijing has pressed the Myanmar junta to rein in scam operations in Laukkaing.In 2023, the Chinese police issued arrest warrants for the most prominent members of these families. Bai Suocheng, the Bai family's patriarch, was among the warlords who were handed to Beijing from Myanmar in early 2024.\"Why is the Chinese government making so much effort to go after the four families?\" a Chinese investigator said in the July documentary.\"It's to warn other people, no matter who you are, where you are, as long as you commit such heinous crimes against the Chinese people, you will pay the price.\"",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump's administration has said it will provide reduced food aid to more than 42 million Americans, as the government shutdown this week heads towards becoming the longest ever with no resolution in sight. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in a court filing that Americans who receive food assistance will get half their normal monthly allotment, after the government dipped into emergency funding. Judges had given the Trump administration until Monday to provide a plan for how it would pay out Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits, also known as food stamps.Funding for the programme has been in limbo due to the more-than-month-long shutdown.While individual US states administer the benefits, the programme relies on money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October.States will get clarity on how they are to distribute the reduced funds by the end of the day on Monday. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled that the USDA needs to use $5.25bn (£4bn) in emergency funds to make at least partial payments to Americans on Snap.Snap costs about $8bn per month. 'I have to get what I need right now': Americans brace for expiry of critical food benefitsTrump administration must continue food aid during shutdown, US judges sayFive ways US government shutdown is hurting - and why it's about to get worseThe judges both said the Trump administration could use the money set aside for contingencies to provide the benefits. President Trump previously said he had instructed government lawyers to ask the courts how the administration could legally fund Snap, adding: \"Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed.\"On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a CNN interview that the president wanted to hear from the courts about how to legally move money around to fund Snap payments, but they could go out as soon as Wednesday.\"There's a process that has to be followed,\" Bessent said. \"So, we've got to figure out what the process is.\"Late last month, the USDA said it would not distribute food-assistance funds starting 01 November because of the shutdown, saying: \"The well has run dry.\"Half the states and the District of Columbia sued the administration over the food-aid freeze and argued that they had a legal obligation to keep the programme running in their jurisdictions. Separately, cities and non-profits also filed a lawsuit. Some states said they would use their own money to fund Snap benefits. Snap allows many low-income Americans to buy groceries. It provides them reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy food.A family of four on average receives $715 per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 per day, per person.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNicolas Négoce,BBC Africa and Natasha BootyThe military commander who has ruled Guinea since a coup four years ago has entered the presidential race ahead of next month's election, breaking an earlier promise to hand power to a civilian government.Gen Mamadi Doumbouya submitted his candidacy at the Supreme Court on Monday, flanked by soldiers and wearing black sunglasses. He did not make any public comment.Two of Guinea's biggest opposition parties  - RPG Arc en Ciel and UFDG - have been excluded from December's contest.This has raised concerns about the election's credibility.Guineans had reacted with shock last month when it was announced that presidential candidates would need to pay a deposit of 875m Guinean francs ($100,000; £75,000) to contest the election.While the previous deposit was almost as high - 800m francs - some analysts had hoped it would be reduced to encourage more people to stand in these historic elections.‎Four years ago, Gen Doumbouya had pledged to hand power back to civilians, saying  \"Neither I nor any member of this transition will be a candidate for anything... As soldiers, we value our word very much.\" ‎‎The election is being held under a new constitution that allowed Gen Doumbouya to run for the presidency.Under his rule, the Guinean authorities have been cracking down on peaceful dissent, including attempts to mobilise people towards a return to democratic rule.The junta has been criticised for suspending media outlets, restricting internet access and brutally suppressing demonstrations.Yet Gen Doumbouya justified deposing then-83-year-old President Alpha Condé on similar charges - including rampant corruption, disregard for human rights and economic mismanagement.Prior to seizing power in the 2021 coup, Gen Doumbouya was a middle-ranking soldier. His 15-year military career included missions in Afghanistan, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Central African Republic and close protection in Israel, Cyprus, the UK and Guinea.Aged 40, he is currently one of the youngest African heads of state.December's election will take place in the absence of several prominent figures - such as ex-President Condé who was kicked out of power in 2021, and former Prime Ministers Cellou Dalein Diallo and Sidya Touré - all of whom are currently living abroad.

    "body": "14 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondentAn investigation into allegations that Sheffield Hallam University faced sustained pressure from China to shut down human rights research has been referred to counter-terrorism police.The BBC and the Guardian newspaper have been reporting that documents show China waged a two-year campaign of intimidation and harassment, including demands the university stop sensitive research by one of its professors into claims of forced labour in the Xinjiang region of China.A South Yorkshire Police spokesperson said the force has referred the investigation on because the \"allegations fall under Section 3 of the National Security Act\".Section 3 of the act deals with \"assisting a foreign intelligence service\".An offence is committed if someone behaves in a way that \"intends that conduct to materially assist a foreign intelligence service in carrying out UK-related activities,\" or in conduct likely to assist that service.Internal documents from Sheffield Hallam University were released under a Subject Access Request to Professor Laura Murphy, whose research is alleged to have been targeted.They showed university staff in China had been threatened by individuals identified as being from China's National Security Service, who demanded the research by Prof Murphy taking place in Sheffield be shut down.The documents went on to state that \"a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service... Immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed\".China is not believed to have an organisation named National Security Service, so it is not clear who the individuals were.A few months later, at the start of this year, Prof Murphy was told by the university that she could not continue her work on China. She started legal action for infringement of her academic freedom. The university then reversed its position. In a statement issued earlier, Sheffield Hallam University had apologised to Prof Murphy.A spokesperson said: \"The university's decision to not continue with Professor Laura Murphy's research was taken based on our understanding of a complex set of circumstances at the time, including being unable to secure the necessary professional indemnity insurance.\"The insurance for social sciences staff had been suspended by the university's insurers as a Chinese firm had brought a defamation suit against Sheffield Hallam after it was named in a report she produced. That lawsuit is ongoing.The university spokesperson added: \"Following a review, we have since approved Professor Murphy's latest research and are committed to supporting her to undertake and disseminate this important work.\"For the avoidance of doubt, the decision was not based on commercial interests in China. \"Regardless, China is not a significant international student market for the University.\"We have apologised to Professor Murphy and wish to make clear our commitment to supporting her research and to securing and promoting freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to present his government's first federal budget on Tuesday, and has warned Canadians to expect \"sacrifices\" as he aims to transform an economy battered by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.Carney has said the spending plan will see both significant cuts and \"generational investments\" to strengthen the economy and reduce the country's reliance on US trade.The plan is also expected to lay out how Canada will pay for billions of dollars in defence spending to fulfil the new Nato commitment to spend 5% of GDP on defence by 2035. Analysts have suggested the federal deficit could exceed C$70bn ($50bn; £38bn), up from $51.7bn last year.The fiscal plan is seen as a major test for Carney, a former central banker for Canada and the UK who has promised to make Canada's economy the strongest in the G7 group of wealthy nations.\"We used to take big, bold risks in this country. It is time to swing for the fences again,\" he said in a pre-budget speech last month. Canada, which trades primarily with the US, has a particular exposure to tariff shocks.Carney has said he is setting a goal for the country to double its non-US exports in the next decade.Joy Nott, a partner at KPMG Canada who focuses on trade and customs, told the BBC that \"Canadian companies need government support during the transition of moving from one market to another\".That includes everything from finding money to travel on trade missions abroad to market research and navigating regulatory approvals when entering new markets.It takes time and money to overcome \"those historic hurdles that we've seen, that prevented them from doing it\", Ms Nott said.Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne underscored the \"made-at-home\" message on Monday as he bought new shoes - a political pre-budget tradition for federal finance ministers - at a Quebec business that supplies footwear worldwide as well as to Canada's armed forces and RCMP officers.The firm was \"emblematic of who we are as a nation\", he told reporters as he stood in the company's manufacturing facility. \"We're moving from reliance to resilience, from uncertainty to prosperity, we're going to do the kind of things that make this country stronger,\" Champagne said. While he said the budget would be focused on \"investments\", Carney has also promised to balance the federal operating budget - day-to-day spending on government programmes - over the next three years.Over the summer, federal ministries were asked to find ways to cut up to 15% from programme spending in the coming years, as the government seeks savings to fund spending into things like trade infrastructure, housing, and tariff-impacted industries.It is still unclear where the Carney's Liberal Party will find the support they need to pass the spending package. The Liberals, who are three seats short of a majority in the House of Commons, need at least one other party to help pass the fiscal plan.Canada faces a potential snap election if the budget vote, which is a confidence vote, fails. Though that is an unlikely scenario so soon after Canadians went to the ballot box in the spring.\"I don't think any of the other parties want to run an election right now,\" said Elizabeth McCallion, a political science professor at the University of Toronto.The most likely support would come from the left-wing NDP, who are currently in the midst of a leadership race after a devastating election performance in April.Prof McCallion said it was possible some NDP members of Parliament would abstain from voting to allow the budget to pass.She said Carney also faced the risk of \"push back against austerity\" measures expected in the budget.Trump has imposed a 35% tariff on Canadian imports, although most goods are exempt from the levies because they fall under a US-Mexico-Canada free trade deal. However, separate global US tariffs on metals, autos, and lumber are hitting those sectors in the country  particularly hard. There are signs the trade uncertainty is weighing on Canada's economy and unemployment is on the rise. The Bank of Canada projects the country's GDP will grow by 1.2% in 2025, 1.1% in 2026 and 1.6% in 2027.",

    "body": "10 hours agoKelly Ng and Jake Kwon,Seoul correspondentKim Yong Nam, North Korea's former ceremonial head of state and a lifelong supporter of the ruling dynasty, has died aged 97, according to state media. He held the role of president of Pyongyang's rubber-stamp Supreme People's Assembly from 1998 to 2019. Kim Yong Nam served in various diplomatic roles under the regime of the country's founder Kim Il Sung, his son Kim Jong Il, and his grandson Kim Jong Un, although he was not related to the family.He died of multiple organ failure on 3 November, according to the North's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The agency described him as an \"old-generation revolutionary who left extraordinary achievements in the development history of our party and country\". A state funeral has been held for him.Kim Yong Nam was born when the Korean peninsula was under Japanese colonial rule, into what KCNA called a family of \"anti-Japanese patriots\". He attended the then brand new Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang and also studied in Moscow, before beginning his career in the 1950s.Starting out as a low-ranking official in the ruling party, he rose to become foreign minister and then served as chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly for nearly all of Kim Jong Il's reign. Even as real power remained in the hands of the ruling Kim family, Kim Yong Nam was often seen as the face of North Korea on the international stage.In 2018, he led a North Korean delegation to South Korea during the Winter Olympics, where he met the South's then-president Moon Jae-in.Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un's influential sister, was part of the delegation.Kim Yong Nam also previously met two other former South Korean presidents: Kim Dae-jung in 2000, and Roh Moo-hyun in 2007 - on both occasions, at inter-Korean summits respectively.South Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young offered condolences, saying he had \"meaningful conversations about peace in the Korean peninsula\" with Kim Yong Nam.Former North Korean diplomat Thae Yong Ho, who has since resettled in the South, told the BBC that Kim Yong Nam never uttered a word that was regarded as problematic by the regime. \"[He] never made his own opinions known... He had no close [allies] or enemies. He never showed any creativity. He never put out a new policy. He only repeated what the Kim family have said before,\" said Thae, who was most recently the leader of South Korea's presidential advisory council on unification.\"Kim Yong Nam is the perfect role model of how to survive for a long time in North Korea,\" Thae said, adding that he avoided criticism from within the party by maintaining a \"clean\" reputation. Unlike many other high-ranking officials in the North, Kim Yong Nam was never demoted even as power was handed down through three generations of the Kim family clan. He retired in April 2019.His longevity was rare as many other officials have been purged, sent to labour camps, or even killed if deemed to have acted against the state's policies.For example, Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of his uncle Chang Song Thaek in 2013 for \"acts of treachery\", state media reported then.Additional reporting by Lee Hyun Choi in Seoul",

    "body": "1 day agoKoh Ewe and Mahfouz Zubaide,BBC ProducerAfghans dig through rubble after earthquake destroys housesAt least 20 people have died after an earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, local authorities say, with the toll expected to rise as rescue efforts continue. Hundreds have also been left injured, local officials told the BBC.The earthquake struck near Mazar-e-Sharif, one of the country's largest cities that is home to about 500,000 people, at around 01:00 local time on Monday, (20:30 GMT on Sunday).It had a magnitude of 6.3 and a depth of 28km (17 miles), according to the US Geological Survey, and was marked at the orange alert level, which indicates \"significant casualties\" are likely. More than 530 people have been injured, according to the Taliban government health ministry.Provincial officials earlier told the BBC that casualties were likely to rise as rescue efforts continued.Getty ImagesAuthorities expect the death toll to rise as search and rescue efforts continueHaji Zaid, a Taliban spokesman in Balkh province wrote earlier on X that \"many people are injured\" in the Sholgara district, south of Mazar-e- Sharif. He said they had received \"reports of minor injuries and superficial damages from all districts of the province\". \"Most of the injuries were caused by people falling from tall buildings,\" he wrote.Many of Mazar-e Sharif's residents rushed to the streets when the quake struck, as they feared their houses would collapse, AFP news agency reported.The quake led to a power outage across the country including in the capital city Kabul, after electricity lines from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan - major suppliers of power to Afghanistan - were damaged. The Taliban spokesman in Balkh also posted a video on X appearing to show debris strewn across the ground at the Blue Mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif, revered by Shia Muslims.The mosque, built in the 15th Century, is believed to house the tomb of the first Shia Imam, the son-in-law and cousin of Prophet Mohamad. It is now a site where pilgrims gather to pray and celebrate religious events.Khalid Zadran, a Taliban spokesman for the police in Kabul, wrote on X that police are \"closely monitoring the situation\". Numerous fatalities were also reported in Samangan, a mountainous province near Mazar-e-Sharif, according to its spokesman. The quake on Monday comes after a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan's mountainous eastern region in late August, killing more than 1,100 people.That earthquake was especially deadly as the rural houses in the region were typically made of mud and timber. Residents were trapped when their houses collapsed during the quake.Afghanistan is very prone to earthquakes because of its location on top of a number of fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.Poor communication networks and infrastructure - buildings there are not earthquake-resistant, for example - have often hampered rescue efforts following disasters like this.",

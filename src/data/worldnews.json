    "body": "7 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentChile's presidential election will go to a run-off vote in December between a Communist Party and a far-right candidate, after a first round on Sunday produced no outright winner.The election campaign was dominated by crime and immigration, as flow of people into the country has grown in recent years, while candidates pledged to fight foreign gangs like Venezuela's Tren de Aragua.The Communist Party's Jeannette Jara, from the governing coalition, narrowly won the first round, followed closely by far-right rival José Antonio Kast.The result is expected to give a boost to Kast, as Jara was the only left-wing candidate running against several right-wing candidates, splitting the right-wing vote.In the 14 December run-off, voters will have to coalesce around one of these two candidates.Kast is expected to pick up votes from other candidates who did not make the final two, including the centre-right Senator Evelyn Matthei and the radical libertarian Congressman Johannes Kaiser. If he wins, it would make Chile the latest country in Latin America to shift to the right.Kast is a conservative lawyer and former congressman who lost the 2021 election's run-off to President Gabriel Boric. This is his third time running for president.The father of nine has promoted a tough crackdown on immigration, including a Trump-style \"border wall\". He opposes abortion even in cases of rape, has criticised environmental and indigenous activism, and wants to shrink the state. His brother was a minister during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship and his father was a member of the Nazi party.Kast said on election night that Chile needed to avoid \"continuity of a very bad government - perhaps the worst government in the democratic history of Chile\".Jara is a member of the Communist Party, but many see her as centre-left in practice. She was a minister in Boric's government and her platform has included pledging to increase production of lithium - a metal vital for electronics - as well as raising the minimum wage, building new prisons and deploying the army to protect Chile's borders.As results were coming through, she said: \"Democracy in our country must be taken care of and valued. And it costs us a lot to recover it, today it is at risk.\"Both candidates have talked up their pledges on crime and immigration, as organised crime and kidnappings having risen in the country.Chile's foreign population has grown since 2017. The National Migration Service said in December 2023 that the flow of people into the country reached more than 1.9 million people. Official estimates suggest at least 330,000 are undocumented migrants living illegally in the country, many from Venezuela.Kast has blamed rising crime on immigration, though several studies suggest that those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average than Chileans.Chile, perceived as more prosperous and safe compared to some other Latin American nations, is a desirable destination for migrants in the region, and for those returning from the US after President Donald Trump's migration crackdown.Kast has pledged to build ditches along Chile's northern border with Peru and Bolivia, as well as mass deportations of undocumented migrants and people who entered the country illegally. He has also promised new maximum-security prisons, like those built in El Salvador.Jara has promised to build new prisons and expel foreigners convicted of drug trafficking.This election was the first time that all eligible voters were automatically registered to vote and that voting was compulsory in Chile.",

    "body": "Jurors in high-profile Australian trial visit beach where murder victim found3 hours agoSimon AtkinsonWangetti Beach, Far North QueenslandSuppliedThe body of Toyah Cordingley was found on a remote beach in northern Queensland in 2018Jurors in a high-profile Australian murder trial have been taken to the remote Queensland beach where the victim was found.Toyah Cordingley was \"repeatedly\" stabbed with a sharp object and put in a shallow sandy grave with \"little or no hope of surviving\", the jury has heard.Rajwinder Singh, 41, denies murdering Ms Cordingley on a Sunday afternoon in October 2018 in Far North Queensland.The 24-year-old's body was discovered by her father the following day on Wangetti Beach - a stretch of coastline between the tourist centres of Cairns and Port Douglas.The jury of ten men and two women plus three back up jurors attended the beach along with the judge and barristers on Monday morning local time, as the second week of the trial got underway.In a nod to the tropical conditions and temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius, the judge, Justice Lincoln Crowley wore a T-shirt, sports shorts and trainers rather than a wig and robes. Both the lead prosecution and defence barristers opted for polo shirts, shorts and baseball caps.The jurors were led around 1.2km north up the sand to see where Ms Cordingley was discovered.Earlier, as they arrived by bus, four red and white cones marked where the victim's car had been parked.The trip was intended to help the jurors get familiar with key locations in the case and no official evidence was given.Last week, the Cairns Supreme Court heard that the day after Ms Cordingley's body was discovered, Mr Singh flew from Australia to India – leaving behind his wife, three children and parents. He was not heard from until he was arrested four years later, the prosecution said.Justice Lincoln Crowley (second from left) with barristers and other court officials at Wangetti BeachIt is alleged that Mr Singh, who was working as a nurse in the town of Innisfail south of Cairns, had a confrontation with Ms Cordingley, whom prosecutor Nathan Crane described as \"a young woman, blonde and attractive\".The pharmacy worker was found wearing a bikini, with all her other clothes and most of her possessions missing. Those items were taken by the killer to avoid detection, the crown alleged.Her dog, Indie, which Ms Cordingley had taken to the beach for a walk, was found tied up to a tree hidden in shrubland about 30 metres from the grave.No murder weapon was ever recovered, and no eyewitnesses have been found.But the prosecution says the crown's case – though circumstantial – was made up of evidence that pointed to Mr Singh \"and eliminated others\".This will include evidence that DNA recovered from a stick at the scene was 3.8 billion times more likely to have come from Mr Singh than a random member of the public.The jury has already heard evidence suggesting that Ms Cordingley's phone left the beach after the killing – and that its movements matched those of a blue Alfa Romeo owned by the accused.Mr Singh's sudden departure from Australia also pointed to his guilt, the prosecution has argued.\"As the police were finding Toyah's body, he was organising … a hurriedly-arranged one way trip back to India,\" Mr Crane said last week as he opened his case.The defence is yet to present any evidence, but in his opening address, Mr Singh's barrister Greg McGuire described his client as a \"placid\" and \"caring\" man, who was in the \"wrong place at the wrong time\".He also foreshadowed evidence to come later in the trial that after his arrest, Mr Singh told an undercover officer he had seen two masked men attack Ms Cordingley and then had run away in fear - something he said was his \"biggest mistake\".Mr McGuire has also said he will give evidence about other people \"both known and unknown\" who should come under suspicion.Ms Cordingley's boyfriend at the time, Marco Heidenreich, whom police quickly ruled out as a possible suspect, was among those who gave evidence last week.The court heard he was an immediate police suspect - and that he had faced questions from Ms Cordingley's father about whether he was involved in his girlfriend's disappearance, even before her body was found.Photographs showing Mr Heidenreich on a hike with a friend on the day Ms Cordingley went missing have been shown to the court, with an expert saying he was confident the pictures were genuine and had not been doctored in any way.The trial will return to the more conventional setting of the court house on Tuesday.",

The explosion happened on Friday evening at Nowgam police station, and the explosives were seized from Faridabad in the northern state of Haryana earlier in the week. The region's director general of police, Nalin Prabhat, said the explosives were being sent for forensic examination - but due to a \"very unfortunate\" mishap during handling they detonated at around 23:20 local time (17:50 GMT).Police said in a statement that it was an accidental detonation, not a terrorist attack. \"Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,\" the police chief told journalists.The police station suffered severe damage in the explosion and adjacent buildings were also affected, he said.Multiple vehicles were \"engulfed in flames and reduced to charred husks, with debris scattered across the site\", according to a police statement. \"The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station,\" a source told Reuters news agency. Most of the victims were police officers, along with forensic personnel, two crime scene photographers, and a tailor who was with the team. Manoj Sinha, the region's Lieutenant Governor appointed by the Indian government, expressed his condolences and said he had ordered an investigation. \"I have ordered a probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion. Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to extremely tragic accidental blast at Nowgam police station in Srinagar. My condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured,\" he wrote on social media.",

They said the ages of the injured bystanders ranged from 20 to 75, while a critically injured person was a 54-year-old man. An investigation was under way, they said.Police said they were told that the 27-year-old driver of the car had been involved in a collision on the track right before it drove into the fence.In a statement published on the Walcha Motorcycle Rally's Facebook page, the Walcha Council said that it was \"shocked and stunned at the unfortunate accident\".The Council said it would work with authorities to \"examine the circumstances which led to the accident\". Giving any comments before concluding the inquiries would be \"inappropriate\", it said.In a post on Facebook, Moylan thanked emergency responders and other bystanders for their \"swift and incredibly professional work at the scene\". \"My thoughts are with everyone affected,\" he wrote.Barnaby Joyce, former deputy prime minister and incumbent New England lawmaker, wrote on Facebook that his \"thoughts, prayer and hopes\" were with those injured in the crash.\"Such a sad end to such a great event,\" he wrote.The Walcha Motorcycle Rally describes itself as a \"grassroots event for motorcycle enthusiasts\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent Ecuadoreans have voted against allowing the return of foreign military bases in the country, frustrating US hopes of expanding its presence in the eastern Pacific region.The referendum result is a blow to Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa, who had campaigned to change the constitution to reverse a ban that the country's legislature passed in 2008.He had said it would help fight organised crime and reduce the soaring violence the country has seen in recent years, during which it has become one of the world's biggest drug-trafficking hotspots.The US had hoped the referendum would pave the way to opening a military base in Ecuador, 16 years after it was made to close a site on its Pacific coast.While Ecuador does not produce cocaine, its huge ports and proximity to Colombia and Peru - where large quantities of the drug are made - make it a desirable and lucrative location for drug-trafficking gangs.About 70% of the world's cocaine passes through Ecuador, according to Noboa.His presidency has been defined by a tough military crackdown on criminal gangs, including by putting armed soldiers on the streets. Supporters say his approach has helped to fight crime, but critics say his government has resorted to authoritarian tactics. The former US military base on Ecuador's Pacific coast was closed after left-wing President Rafael Correa decided not to renew its lease and pushed for the constitutional ban.US Homeland Secretary Secretary Kristi Noem recently toured military facilities in Ecuador with Noboa.Noboa told the BBC earlier this year that he wanted foreign \"armies\" to join what he has described as a \"war\" against narco-trafficking groups. He has recently held talks over increased regional security and migration co-operation with US officials.The referendum also saw voters reject ending public funding for political parties, shrinking the size of Congress, and establishing a constitutional assembly to re-write Ecuador's constitution.Noboa had argued a fresh constitution would allow for tougher punishments for criminals and stronger measures to secure the borders, but critics argued it would not solve wider social problems like insecurity and poor access to education or healthcare in some areas.Critics also feared the plans to reduce funding for political parties and the size of Congress could lead to a reduction in checks and balances on the government and representation in poorer areas, though the government hoped it would save public funds.Noboa reacted by saying he would \"respect\" the outcome of the vote.On the day of the referendum, the leader of one of Ecuador's biggest drug-trafficking gangs, Los Lobos, was captured in an operation involving Spanish police.Wilmer \"Pipo\" Chavarria had faked his own death and had been hiding in Europe while controlling criminal operations like drug-trafficking, ordering murders and illegal mining in Ecuador, Noboa said.Both Ecuador and the US have designated Los Lobos as a terrorist organisation under domestic law.This referendum came as the US sent its largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades, including the world's largest warship and bomber planes.It has carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the eastern Pacific and the Caribbean, killing at least 83 people. It has not provided evidence about who was aboard and some lawyers have said the strikes may breach international law.Speculation is mounting over whether the US will strike land targets in Venezuela.The US alleges that its President Nicolás Maduro is the head of a narco-trafficking organisation, an accusation he strongly denies. Many observers believe the US military build-up in the region is also an attempt to put pressure on Maduro to force him from power.",

More than 1,500 people have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean in 2025 so far, according to data from the IOM. Around a third of those cases happened off Libya's coast.The North African nation was the departure point for the majority of the almost 59,000 people who arrived in Europe this year via the central Mediterranean route, according to Frontex, the European Union's border security agency. Earlier this week, dozens of migrants who boarded a small boat in Libya were missing and presumed dead after it capsized in the Mediterranean. Seven survivors - from Sudan, Somalia, Cameroon and Nigeria - were rescued after being lost at sea for nearly a week.",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to \"overhaul\" state-owned energy companies, after a major corruption scandal engulfed the country's energy sector.Around $100 million (£76m) has been embezzled, anti-graft investigators said, causing outrage in a country where Russian attacks have resulted in crippling power outages.\"Alongside a full audit of their financial activities, the management of these companies is to be renewed,\" Zelensky wrote in a post on X on Saturday. Energoatom, the state nuclear company at the heart of the scandal, will have a new supervisory board \"within a week,\" he added. Several of those implicated in the scandal have close links to the Ukrainian president.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" Zelensky wrote. He also called for the quick appointment of a new head of Ukrhydroenergo, a hydropower generating company, and reforms for oil and gas giant Naftogaz and the nation's Gas Transmission System Operator. Two ministers were forced to resign over the corruption scheme and a former business partner of Zelensky was sanctioned earlier this week when the scandal broke.On Monday, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the 15 month-long investigation had revealed several members of the Ukrainian government were involved.Some of those implicated in the scandal are or have been, close associates of Zelensky's. Among those alleged to be involved are Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95.Zelensky has previously said he is committed to cooperate fully with the anti-corruption investigation.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" he said on Saturday.\"The full transparency and integrity in the energy sector remain an absolute priority.\"But the scandal has brought Zelensky's commitment to fighting corruption under scrutiny once again. In July, he faced backlash after he signed a law limiting the independence of Nabu and Sap. The outrage was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate their freedom, but the debacle prompted criticism from European allies including France and Germany, while ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressed the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.",

    "body": "2 days agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporter and Nardine SaadUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.The move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has focused on the issue since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.The dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.These goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Trump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.He has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead. But grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".He has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.  But the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".He added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\" \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.Economists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.While inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed price increases, with groceries up 2.7% from last year.The Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.In another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.The White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include: CoffeeCocoaBlack teaGreen teaVanilla beansBeef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meatFruits, including acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoesSpices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmericNuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts",

    "body": "A man has been arrested in connection with a deadly car bomb attack that killed eight people and wounded 20 others in Delhi last week, authorities have said.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said the car used in the attack, which the government has called a \"terrorist incident\", was registered in the arrested suspect's name.It has accused him of conspiring with the alleged suicide bomber. The suspect was a resident of Indian-administered Kashmir, authorities say. The explosion happened near a metro station close to the Red Fort, one of Delhi's most high-profile landmarks.The agency said it had seized another vehicle allegedly belonging to the suicide bomber for examination. So far, it has interrogated 73 witnesses, including people injured in the blast.The blast outside the historic fort was the first such explosion in the heavily guarded city since 2011.Monday evening's attack took place at 18:52 local time (13:22 GMT) when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a busy traffic signal and then exploded.Within hours of the incident, Home Minister Shah confirmed the explosion had taken place in a white Hyundai i20.Footage from the location showed remains of a charred white car and a number of other gutted vehicles, including an autorickshaw and cycle rickshaws.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the attack a \"conspiracy\", and his government vowed to bring the \"perpetrators, their collaborators and their sponsors\" to justice.Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said the news was \"extremely heartbreaking\".Police said on Thursday that they were investigating any links to the recent arrests of seven men by police in Indian-administered Kashmir.Potential connections to the the recent seizure of 2,900kg of explosives from a Delhi suburb were also being probed, police said.The Red Fort is visited by thousands of tourists every day, and was built in the 17th Century. Indian prime ministers use the Mughal fortress as a backdrop for their annual Independence Day speeches.",

    "body": "15 hours agoRuth ComerfordReutersWater levels in Tehran's Amirkabir dam are at 8% of capacity, officials sayAuthorities in Iran have sprayed clouds with chemicals to induce rain, in an attempt to combat the country's worst drought in decades.Known as cloud-seeding, the process was conducted over the Urmia lake basin on Saturday, Iran's official news agency Irna reported.Urmia is Iran's largest lake, but has largely dried out leaving a vast salt bed. Further operations will be carried out in east and west Azerbaijan, the agency said. Rainfall is at record lows and reservoirs are nearly empty. Last week President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that if there is not enough rainfall soon, Tehran's water supply could be rationed and people may be evacuated from the capital.Cloud seeding involves injecting chemical salts including silver or potassium iodide into clouds via aircraft or through generators on the ground. Water vapour can then condense more easily and turn into rain.The technique has been around for decades, and the UAE has used it in recent years to help address water shortages.Iran's meteorological organisation said rainfall had decreased by about 89% this year compared with the long-term average, Irna reported.\"We are currently experiencing the driest autumn the country has experienced in 50 years,\" it added.Officials have also announced plans to penalise households and businesses that consume excessive amounts of water.EPA/ShutterstockWomen during the rainfall prayer at the Saleh Shrine in northern TehranThe head of Iran's National Centre for Climate and Drought Crisis Management, Ahmad Vazifeh said dams in Tehran, West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Markazi are in a \"worrying state\", with water levels in the single-digit percentages.On Friday, hundreds gathered at a mosque in Tehran to pray for rainfall.Iranian meteorologists reported there was some rainfall in the west and northwest of the country on Saturday - with video showing snowfall on a ski resort north of Tehran for the first time this year.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"On Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.The corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.The BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation. \"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"The president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.A search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.A BBC spokesperson said on Saturday evening: \"We have had no further contact from President Trump's lawyers at this point. \"Our position remains the same.\"In a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"He called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.In July this year, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.Sir Craig Oliver, former BBC editor and ex-director of politics and communications for former Prime Minister David Cameron, told BBC Today programme that this is a \"nightmare\" situation for the public broadcaster. \"The problem is that public money could be spent fighting this or settling this,\" Sir Craig said, adding that Trump doesn't \"understand the BBC, how it is funded or how it works\". Watch: Trump says he will sue the BBC. Gary O'Donoghue explains what's nextThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Controversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.First it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.The BBC's apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutes",

    "body": "1 day agoRuth Comerford and Ethirajan Anbarasan,Global Affairs reporterWatch: Protesters against violent crime and the Sheinbaum government clash with police in Mexico CityAt least 120 people - 100 of them police officers - have been injured in clashes during anti-government protests in Mexico City, police said.Thousands of demonstrators marched in the Mexican capital on Saturday to protest against violent crime and President Claudia Sheinbaum's government.Sheinbaum said the marches, which also took place in other cities, had been funded by right-wing politicians who oppose her government.The rally was organised by Gen Z youth groups, drawing support from citizens protesting against high-profile killings, including the assassination just weeks ago of Uruapan Mayor Carlos Manzo - who had called for tough action against cartels.Demonstrators dismantled parts of a barrier protecting the National Palace, where Sheinbaum lives. Police protecting the compound used tear gas on the crowds.Authorities have arrested 20 people for crimes including robbery and assault, Mexico City security chief Pablo Vazquez told reporters.Protesters waved banners displaying messages including \"We are all Carlos Manzo\", while others wore cowboy hats in tribute to him.EPAManzo was shot on 1 November while he attended a Day of the Dead festival.He was known for speaking openly about drug-trafficking gangs in his town and cartel violence. He had been demanding tough action against armed cartel members who terrorise the country. Sheinbaum has been acting against cartels but resisting calls for another all-out war on drugs. Previous attempts by her predecessors have ended with bloody results.Days before the march took place, the president said the demonstration was being promoted by bots online.\"We agree with freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration if there are young people who have demands, but the issue here is who is promoting the demonstration,\" she said in a briefing. \"People should know how this demonstration was organised so that no one is used.\"ReutersSome protesters paid tribute to Uruapan mayor Carlos ManzoSheinbaum retains approval ratings above 70% in her first year in office, and has made in-roads in clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, Donald Trump.But she has been criticised for failing to halt the violence gripping the country and is facing increased hostility from nearby countries.Earlier this month, Peru's Congress voted to declare Sheinbaum a persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision came days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.",

    "body": "2 days agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, RomeReutersPope Leo has held an audience with Hollywood stars, urging actors and directors including Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as \"pilgrims of the imagination\", helping to \"bring hope\".The celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.It was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the \"troubling decline\" in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a \"great day\", the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate – and for its \"capacity to amaze\".But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called \"the world's wounds\".\"Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated,\" the Pope said. \"Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.\"Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leo's style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.Watch: Among the stars to meet the Pope was Spike Lee who had a unique gift for Leo XIV.It's not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall – who came from all over the world – made it onto the Pope's own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, It's a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benigni's multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.Among those who did join today's A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant – of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the \"quiet dedication\" of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.ReutersThe audience for the international filmmakers was held beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the \"beating heart of communities\".\"More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity,\" the Pope said.After a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by Blanchett.\"He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people,\" the Australian-born star told reporters.One of many who came bearing gifts, the actress – who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR – placed a woven bracelet in the Pope's hand. \"It was a bracelet I wear in solidarity with people who are displaced,\" she explained later.Lee handed the Chicago-born Pope a New York Knicks shirt printed with the number 14 and the words Pope Leo.",

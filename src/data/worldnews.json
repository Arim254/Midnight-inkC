    "body": "Thousands fleeing DR Congo violence face 'dire conditions' in Burundi - aid agencies8 hours agoNomsa Maseko,BBC AfricaandBasillioh RukangaThe nearly 90,000 refugees who fled to Burundi after the recent escalation of violence in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo face dire conditions in cramped camps with limited access to food and water, aid agencies sayCongolese M23 rebels recently captured the city of Uvira, near the Burundi border,  and the fighting forced hundreds of thousands from their homes. The rebels say they have since withdrawn.Medical charity MSF, which has been providing emergency help, has raised concerns about the worsening humanitarian situation.The UN's refugee agency, UNCHR, said those especially affected are children and women - including pregnant women - some who reported going without food for days.MSF said it had been treating an average of 200 people daily since the refugees started arriving in Burundi in the last two weeks.\"We see people in a state of distress, despair and exhaustion. We see women who gave birth while fleeing, some that give birth in our clinic,\" said Zakari Moluh, the MSF project co-ordinator describing the situation in Ndava, north-west Burundi.The charity has warned of the risk of the \"spread of epidemic diseases such as cholera and measles, and a catastrophic increase of malaria cases\" among vulnerable people.Meanwhile, the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) says it is increasing its life-saving aid to over 210,000 of the most vulnerable people displaced by the DR Congo violence.It notes that about half a million people have been forced from their homes in South Kivu province since the beginning of December.The WFP says it is supporting 71,000 new Congolese arrivals to Burundi with hot meals in transit centres.It adds that services across the province are on the brink of collapse, as \"health centres have been looted, medicines are unavailable, and schools remain closed\". The agency has called for urgent funding to be able to continue providing food aid in the next three months.The capture of Uvira at the beginning of the month extended the M23's territorial gains in eastern DR Congo after they had earlier captured the major cities of Goma and Bukavu.The rebels said they would pull out of Uvira last week under pressure from the US, but their reported withdrawal has been disputed by Congolese authorities.The US brokered a peace deal between the Congolese and Rwandan governments aimed at ending the long-running conflict in DR Congo. The US accuses Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels, which it denies.The rebels were not signatories to that peace deal but they have been part of a parallel peace process led by Qatar, a US ally that has strong ties with Rwanda.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe US economy picked up speed over the three months to September, as consumer spending jumped and exports increased. The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years.The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending.But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America.Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\".\"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added.The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%.It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services.Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply,  bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints. Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the economy was well positioned as it headed into 2026, when it will start to feel the boost from tax cuts and the US central bank's recent moves to drop interest rates. \"Underlying measures are consistent with a solid expansion,\" he said. In a post on social media, Trump celebrated the figures, saying his tariffs were responsible. He has been on the defensive amid souring consumer confidence and polls indicating dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy.However, some analysts warned that rising prices faced by some households could  make it difficult to sustain the unusually strong pace of growth seen in the most recent quarter. Over the three months to September, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ticked up 2.8%, compared with 2.1% in the previous quarter, according to the report. Analysts have warned that those price increases are weighing on lower and middle income households, even as higher income households continue to spend freely. Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that some more recent surveys and credit card data suggest that households are reining in their spending. \"The weak labour market, stagnant real incomes, and exhaustion of pandemic-era excess savings all seem finally to be catching up with households,\" he said.

They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger,\" they said.He was one of two police officers injured in the shooting, with the second officer Constable Scott Dyson, 25, still recovering from his injuries in hospital, according to the last police update.Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon visited Constable Hibbert in hospital, praising him as a \"positive young man\".Lanyon added that the force would rally around Constable Hibbert and find \"appropriate duties for him\" after his recovery.Police have alleged the suspected gunmen were inspired by Islamic State ideology and targeted the Jewish festival in what has been declared a terror attack.Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.On Monday, new court documents alleged the pair \"meticulously\" planned the attack for months, and two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.",

    "body": "8 hours agoEmir Nader,JerusalemandDavid GrittenIsrael's parliament has extended an order allowing the government to shut down foreign broadcasters operating in the country.The legislation, passed by 22 votes to 10, expands temporary powers introduced during the Gaza war to shutter outlets seen as a threat to national security.It allows the government for the next two years to cease operations of a foreign outlet even in peace time and without the need for a court order.Originally dubbed the \"Al Jazeera Law\", the powers were used to shut down the Qatari-owned channel's offices and block its broadcasts in May 2024.Israel accused Al Jazeera - which has been a strong critic of Israel's military campaign in Gaza - of anti-Israel bias and of supporting Hamas in its coverage.Al Jazeera denied the accusations and condemned Israel's actions, calling it a \"criminal act\" and an attack on press freedom.The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) said last year that the temporary order violated \"freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press, and blocks citizens and residents from receiving a variety of information that does not fit the Israeli narrative or is not broadcast on Israeli media channels\".The legislation extending the order was passed hours after the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to shut down Army Radio, or Galei Tzahal (GLZ), a state-funded station that is operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) but is editorially independent.Under the plan proposed by Defence Minister Israel Katz, the station will cease operations by 1 March 2026.Katz argued that Army Radio, which employs both active duty soldiers and civilians, \"no longer serves as a mouthpiece and ear for soldiers and broadcasts political and divisive content that is not in line with IDF values\".Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the cabinet meeting that a station broadcasting under the authority of the military was highly unusual. \"I think it exists in North Korea and maybe a few other countries, and we probably don't want to be counted among them,\" he said.The Union of Journalists and Journalists' Organisations said they would petition the High Court of Justice against the decision, calling it \"a severe and unlawful infringement on freedom of expression and freedom of the press\". The Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) think tank said shutting Army Radio constituted a serious violation of freedom of expression and effectively wiped out half of Israel's independent public radio news broadcasts.\"The decision to shut down a public media organisation is not an isolated move. It is part of a broader and worrying pattern of ongoing harm to Israeli democracy,\" it warned.",

    "body": "A journalist based in Plateau state said the families of the latest victims had begun receiving ransom demands.The police have not said anything about the identity of the possible perpetrators.Kidnapping for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become common across parts of northern and central Nigeria.Although the handing over of cash in order to release those being held is illegal, it is thought that this is how many cases are resolved and seen as a way for these gangs to raise money. The incident in Plateau state is unrelated to the long-running Islamist insurgency in the country's north-east, where jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.The insecurity in Nigeria received renewed international attention in November after US President Donald Trump threatened to send troops to \"that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing'\". He alleged that Christians were being targeted.Nigeria's federal government has acknowledged the security problems but has denied that Christians are being singled out.On Monday, Information Minister Mohammed Idris said that recent tensions with the US over insecurity and alleged persecution of Christians had been \"largely resolved\", resulting in stronger relations with Washington.He added that trained and equipped forest guards will be deployed to secure forests and other remote areas used as hideouts by criminal groups to supplement army operations.Additional reporting by Abayomi Adisa and BBC Monitoring",

She had maybe three inches of air gap to breathe in.\"And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.\"Earlier the Mexican Navy Secretariat said search and rescue operations were under way in co-ordination with the US Coast Guard.Video taken near Scholes International Airport in Galveston showed rescuers including a dive team working in dense fog.In a statement shared on X, the Michou y Mau Foundation sent \"our deepest condolences to the families of the victims of this tragedy\".",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said the US will keep or sell the crude oil contained on tankers it has seized off the coast of Venezuela, as well as the vessels themselves.The US president's comments came as Washington continues to pressure the South American country's leader Nicolás Maduro to stand down.Speaking to reporters in Florida on Monday, Trump said of the oil \"we're going to keep it\", adding: \"Maybe we will sell it, maybe we will keep it. Maybe we'll use it in the Strategic Reserves. We're keeping the ships also.\"The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil revenues to fund drug-related crime, while Caracas has condemned the seizures as \"piracy\".The US military has seized two oil tankers this month, including one on Saturday.Trump issued his latest warning as the US Coast Guard continued to pursue a third oil tanker, which authorities described as part of a Venezuelan \"dark fleet\" used to evade US sanctions.\"It's moving along, and we'll end up getting it,\" Trump said. Separately on Monday, the US military said it carried out a strike on what it said was a suspected trafficking vessel in international waters in the eastern Pacific. US Southern Command said one person was killed.When asked whether the goal of the seizures was to force Maduro from power, Trump responded: \"Well, I think it probably would... That's up to him what he wants to do. I think it'd be smart for him to do that. But again, we're gonna find out.\"The US has been building up its military presence in the Pacific and Caribbean Seas and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.It has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.Speaking on Monday, Trump repeated that the US intends to strike targets on land too.He said: \"We'll be starting the same programme on land. If they want to come by land, they're going to end up having a big problem. They're going to get blown to pieces, because we don't want our people poisoned.\"Speaking on state television, Maduro responded to Trump by saying: \"He would be better off in his own country dealing with economic and social issues and the world would be better off if he focused on his own country's affairs.\"Since returning to office in January, Trump has doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture, accusing him of being \"one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world\".The Trump administration has designated Maduro's government as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO), and last week ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela.As the Venezuelan government relies heavily on oil exports to finance public spending, the latest measures have sparked outrage among officials in Caracas.At Venezuela's request, the UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss what the government has described as \"ongoing US aggression\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoSen NguyenBangkokGetty ImagesTens of thousands of tourists annually use slow boat and speedboat services along the Mekong It was supposed to be just another Thursday in Laos, where Anthonin's father was born.Instead, the 30-year-old French citizen found himself among more than 140 people, mostly tourists, on a ferry that capsized in the Mekong River. All but three are thought to have made it to safety.Videos online show a scene of chaos - people screaming for help, children crying and passengers scrambling to get their belongings.Anthonin, who declined to give his full name, recalls seeing a mother and her two children on board the ferry - but they were nowhere to be seen on the rescue boat.On Monday, Lao media reported that the body of a woman, named Pany Her, had been retrieved from the river. Rescuers then found the body of a one-year-old, who they believe was one of her children. Efforts to find a second child are continuing.'Only 15 lifejackets'The boat was making its way last Thursday from the riverside town of Huay Xay to the historic city of Luang Prabang in northern Laos, a common route along the Mekong - and popular with visitors to the country.There were 118 tourists and 29 locals, including four crew, on board the boat when it struck underwater rocks near the Tam Ting (Pak Ou) caves, according to an official report carried by the Laotian Times.Within minutes, the ferry began to sink.\"The [crew] were just totally unprepared for that. There was a lot of confusion... it happened really, really fast,\" Anthonin said.\"What was, you know, puzzling and alarming is that there were very few life jackets, around like, 15 life jackets maximum... [it] was really bad.\"As the boat continued to capsize, passengers shouted to a passing boat for help, but it did not stop - possibly because, according to him, it was relatively small.The second one, however, did stop and take them in. However, according to British tourist Bradley Cook, another passenger on board, that briefly \"made it worse\".The 27-year-old told the BBC that as the rescue boat came closer to their ferry, people started to shift and put weight on one side of the ferry, causing water to fill up the hull even quicker.Mr Cook went to the other side to climb up on the roof, from where he jumped onto the rescue ferry.Some people managed to climb over to the ferry, while others swam for it, hung onto the rails and got pulled up by others. Both Anthonin and Mr Cook were among those rescued.But others were less fortunate.Anthonin says he was helping some other passengers retrieve their luggage at the back of the sinking ferry when he saw a Lao mother and her two children.However, when he was on the rescue ferry, he realised they weren't there.\"Some people were crying, panicking. It was a mess,\" he said. \"[But] I didn't fear for my life... I was more affected by the three missing people.\"Lao media later reported that the body of the Lao woman Pany Her and a one-year-old child were found, separately, near Luang Prabang.Another passenger, Gabrielius Baranovičius, 19, told the BBC that he and his friend, both of whom are from Lithuania, did not panic at first.\"We were just joking around,\" Mr Baranovičius said, adding that his attitude quickly changed when he realised they were sinking.After getting on the rescue boat, Mr Baranovičius said he starting filming what was happening on board \"but then I heard other people screaming so [I] turned off the camera and went straight to help other people in the water get on the boat.\"Tens of thousands of tourists use slow boat and speedboat services every year along the 300km (185-mile) route connecting Huay Xay, Pak Beng and Luang Prabang, according to the Mekong River Commission.For Mr Cook, the experience was \"terrifying\" and it made him want to get out of Luang Prabang, \"although everyone's really friendly here\", because it was a constant reminder of his narrow escape.Speaking to the BBC from Vang Vieng, a town in northern Laos, Mr Cook said he planned to file for insurance claims for his electrical items that were broken and for cash that was lost, though he was not sure who would be held responsible.\"I'm assuming it's just a freak accident,\" he said, though he added he \"was not sure how avoidable\" the ferry capsizing was.It's not the first time such a sinking has occurred in Laos.In September 2023, a passenger boat, which travelled on the same river corridor between Huay Xai and Luang Prabang, capsized in the Mekong in Pakbeng district, resulting in three deaths.The boat reportedly became entangled in a fishing net, causing loss of control and the vessel overturning in strong currents.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoAlex SmithandAnthony Reuben,BBC VerifyDavidoff Studios/Getty ImagesA file photo of Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump, then a real estate developer, at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida in 1997US President Donald Trump was listed as a passenger on the private jet of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein eight times between 1993 and 1996, a new email released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) says.\"Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware),\" reads the 7 January 2020 email from an assistant US attorney.Trump's name on the flight record does not indicate wrongdoing. In 2024, Trump wrote: \"I was never on Epstein's Plane\". He has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. The DOJ says some files released on Tuesday \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" against Trump.Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in about 2004 - years before Epstein was first arrested.The latest release of documents - running to more than 30,000 pages - is part of the so-called Epstein files the DOJ was legally required to publish in their entirety by last Friday. Live: What the newly-released files contain and reactionIn a statement on Tuesday, the DOJ said: \"Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.\"\"Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein's victims,\" the DOJ statement on X said. The prosecutor's email was sent on 7 January 2020 and is part of an email chain which includes the subject heading: \"RE: Epstein flight records.\"The sender and recipient are redacted, but the bottom of the email says assistant US attorney, Southern District of New York - with the name redacted.The email states that Trump \"is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which [Epstein's associate Ghislaine] Maxwell was also present. He is listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric.\"\"On one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old...\" - the rest of the sentence has been redacted.It continues: \"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\"In 2022, Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for crimes including conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and sex trafficking of a minor.Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited his trial on sex trafficking charges.US Department of JusticeAn extract from the 2020 email, released by the US Department of JusticeThe prosecutor's email does not provide more details about the flights.A handwritten flight log released by the DOJ in February appears to have many entries which are difficult to read. However, one lists Donald Trump, as well as his son Eric, for a flight on 13 August 1995 from PBI (Palm Beach International Airport in Florida) to TEB (Teterboro Airport in New Jersey). It also lists JE and GM - widely believed to be acronyms for Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.Tuesday's release of files related to Epstein is the largest so far - but many more documents held by the DOJ are yet to be made public. Several thousand files have been published across eight batches since Friday.The DOJ missed last Friday's deadline set by Congress to publish all its files related to Epstein - including photos, videos and investigative materials. The department has faced criticism from survivors and lawmakers from across the aisle for its failure to meet that deadline.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on the day of the deadline that not all the files would be made public immediately, and that more would be published over the coming weeks.\"There's a lot of eyes looking at these, so we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials that we're producing, we're protecting every single victim,\" he said on Friday.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAlex Smith and Jaroslav LukivandMohamed Madi,KyivReutersSiversk has been virtually wiped out as a town during many months of heavy fightingUkrainian troops have withdrawn from the embattled eastern town of Siversk, as Russia continues its steady - albeit slow - advance.The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday it acted \"to preserve the lives of our soldiers and the combat capability of units\", adding that Russian forces had a \"significant advantage in manpower\".The capture of Siversk brings Russia closer to the last remaining \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk still in Ukrainian hands in the industrial Donetsk region.Earlier in the day, officials said three people - including a young child - were killed in massive overnight Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine.Watch: BBC correspondent at the scene of Kyiv drone attackRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In a statement, the Ukrainian military said Russian troops were continuing \"active offensive actions\" in the Siversk area \"despite significant losses\".It added that Ukrainian \"defence forces had exhausted the enemy during the fighting for Siversk\".Before the Russian invasion, Siversk had about 11,000 people.Two weeks ago Russia had already reported control over the town - but Ukraine denied the claim at the time.Siversk has been virtually wiped out as a town during many months of heavy fighting.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The regions are collectively known as Donbas.Russian leader Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from all of Donbas or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been under heavy pressure from his US counterpart Donald Trump to cede all of Donbas to Russia during ongoing Washington-led peace negotiations.Zelensky has so far rejected any territorial concessions, and instead demanded iron-clad security guarantees for Ukraine in any potential settlement.The peace negotiations - involving separate meetings of US officials with their Ukrainian and Russian counterparts - continued over the weekend but no breakthrough was reported.According to Zelensky, the US had proposed a Christmas truce but Russia rejected the idea.Overnight, Russia launched 635 drones and 38 missiles on a number of Ukrainian regions, Ukraine's air force said, adding that 621 of them were downed.Local authorities in the central Zhytomyr region confirmed a child's death.Regional head Vitaly Bunechko said the child \"was taken to hospital, doctors fought for (the child's) life but could not save (the child) in the end\". Five others were injured in the strike, he added.Meanwhile, a 76-year-old woman was killed and three people injured when a house in the Kyiv region was struck, according to Ukraine's state emergencies service.An attack in Khmelnytskyy, western Ukraine, killed a 72-year-old, regional administration head Serhiy Tyurin said.Polish fighter jets were scrambled in response to missiles and drones targeting west Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry said it had targeted Ukrainian \"military-industrial complex plants and supporting energy facilities\". It added that all the designated targets had been hit.Meanwhile, Ukraine reportedly struck a petrochemical plant in Stravropol, southern Russia.Videos shared by Russian media channels online showed large flames rising from the direction of the plant.The region's governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said a Ukrainian drone hit the plant and sparked a fire. No casualties were reported and residential buildings were left undamaged.Oleksandr Chyrvonyi, who lives in the city of Zaporizhzhia close to the front line,  told the BBC that Monday night was \"an extremely unpleasant experience\".\"I had four or five hours' sleep - there were constant notifications waking me up that drones and cruise missiles were coming,\" he said, adding that most went past his city to western and central regions. Power cuts are the new normal. Zaporizhzhia has around 10 hours of electricity out of 24, he said.There is a \"general feeling of the lack of civilisation\", he continued, but said he tries to have \"an illusion of a normal life\".ReutersEmergency responders work at the site of a Russian drone strike on an apartment building in the Ukrainian capitalWith temperatures expected to fall to as low as -7C on Wednesday, Ukraine's energy operator warned of emergency power shutdowns \"in all regions\" and urged people to use energy \"sparingly\". Acting energy minister Artem Nekrasov said it was the ninth large attack on Ukraine's energy system this year, and that supply in the Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions has been \"almost completely\" lost.Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Merezhko told the BBC World Service that some areas could be without power \"for days\".In the Ukrainian capital, many suspect the overnight attack is linked to Monday's killing of a top Russian general after a car bomb exploded in Moscow.Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov - the head of the armed forces' operational training department - died in the blast, which Russia has blamed on Ukraine. Kyiv has not commented.Additional reporting by Gabriela Pomeroy ",

    "body": "Trump unveils plans for 'Golden Fleet' battleships named after himself20 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat Mar-a-LagoWatch: Trump announces new class of Navy battleshipsPresident Donald Trump has announced that the US will commission a new series of heavily armed Navy \"battleships\" named after himself, as part of a revamped \"Golden Fleet\".Construction on the Trump-class USS Defiant ship, which will be equipped to carry an array of weapons, is expected to begin soon, with Trump saying the first vessels will be operational in two-and-a-half years.The announcement is part of a larger planned expansion of the US Navy by President Trump in both manned and unmanned vessels, including larger missile-armed warships and smaller vessels.Officials have warned that the US currently lags behind China in both shipbuilding capacity and total output.Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida alongside defence secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of the Navy John Phelan on Monday, Trump said he approved the construction of two new battleships to start, with a plan to build up to 25.  \"They'll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,\" Trump said.Once completed, Trump said the armed vessels would be equipped to carry hypersonic and \"extremely lethal\" weapons, and would be the flagships of the US Navy. Trump, who spoke while flanked on both sides with posters of renderings of the \"Trump class\" ships, said the vessels would be built domestically, and their construction would create \"thousands\" of jobs. ReutersTrump said he approved the construction of two new battleships to start, with a plan to build up to 25In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Phelan said that Trump had specifically asked for a \"big, beautiful\" battleship-type vessel as part of the fleet, which will also include dozens of support and transport vessels. On 19 December, another new set of vessels, based on the US Coast Guard's Legend-class National Security Cutter, were announced by the US Navy.\"Recent operations from the Red Sea to the Caribbean make the requirement undeniable - our small surface combatant inventory is a third of what we have,\" Chief of Naval Operations Daryl Caudle said in a video statement about the new ships.  \"We need more capable blue water small combatants to close the gap and keep our [destroyers] focused on the high-end fight,\" he added. ReutersTrump unveiled a rendering of the Trump Class USS Defiant at an announcement in Mar-a-Lago on MondayA similar vessel, the Constellation-class frigate - which Trump approved during his first term in office - was cancelled in 2025 after repeated delays and cost overruns. Only two ships were reportedly expected to be delivered after approximately $2bn (£1.49bn) was spent on the project. US officials and defence analysts have repeatedly warned that the US is lagging behind China, its main potential maritime rival, in shipbuilding capacity. Over 60% of the world's orders this year went to Chinese shipyards, and its navy is already the largest in the world. Since returning to office in January, Trump has vowed to revive the US shipbuilding industry. \"We used to make so many ships,\" Trump said in March. \"We don't make them very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.\" In October, Trump and Finnish President Alexander Stubb penned a deal for the US to purchase 11 Finnish-designed icebreakers, including seven built in the US with Finnish expertise. The president's announcement also comes as US naval and air assets have surged to the Caribbean amid rising tensions with Venezuela. The US started attacking vessels in September that were alleged to be carrying drugs, with strikes leaving at least 100 people dead. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump claimed that thousands of American lives had been saved because of the boat strikes by stopping lethal drugs from entering the US.The attacks have been criticised by some experts, who said they could violate international laws governing armed conflict.",

    "body": "Baby followed by BBC back in Gaza hospital after treatment abroad1 day agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondentBBCSiwar Ashour spent six months in Jordan after being evacuated from GazaA one-year-old Palestinian girl evacuated from Gaza with severe nutritional problems is back in hospital in the territory after being returned there from Jordan. Siwar Ashour, whose story the BBC has followed for several months, was repatriated to Gaza on 3 December after completing her medical treatment in Amman.She'd spent six months in hospital there under a medical evacuation programme run by the Kingdom of Jordan. Her grandmother, Sahar Ashour, said she became ill three days after coming back.\"She started having diarrhoea and vomiting and her situation keeps getting worse. The diarrhoea won't go away,\" she told a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering Gaza independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago.Siwar is being treated at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza Strip where Dr Khalil al-Daqran told the BBC she is \"receiving the necessary treatment, but the situation is still bad for her\". The doctor said Siwar was suffering from a gastro-intestinal infection. She has an immune system deficiency which makes it hard for her to fight bacteria. She also struggles to absorb nutrition, meaning she requires specialised baby formula.Dr Khalil al-Daqran said poor hygiene conditions had disease to spreadDr Daqran said that hospitals in Gaza - many of which were badly damaged by Israeli bombing and fighting nearby with Hamas before a ceasefire took effect in October - were seeing an increase in child admissions. Poor hygiene conditions caused by the destruction of vital infrastructure have led to the spread of infections and disease.\"Since the ceasefire was announced, the number of child patients arriving at Gaza Strip hospitals is three times the capacity… The situation at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is no different from other hospitals in the Gaza Strip.\"It suffers from a severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies, and a major shortage regarding electric generators, which are the main artery to keep a hospital going.\"The World Health Organization (WHO) described humanitarian needs in Gaza as \"staggering, with current assistance addressing only the most basic survival requirements\".Siwar was evacuated to Jordan in June after the BBC reported on her case and raised it directly with the Jordanian authorities.Jordan's Minister of Communications, Dr Mohammed al-Momani, told us that Siwar was among 45 children returned to Gaza after completing their treatment. Under the evacuation scheme all patients are sent back after medical attention.I put it to Dr al-Momani that people might find it hard to accept that a child in such a vulnerable condition could be sent back to Gaza in the current conditions.\"No patient is sent back before they finish their medical treatment… the first reason [why they are returned] is that this will allow us to bring more patients from Gaza. We cannot take all of them at once. We have to take them in batches. So far we have taken 18 batches. \"The second reason is that we don't want to contribute in any shape or form to the displacement of Palestinians from their land and all patients are told… after treatment you are sent back so other patients and other children can be brought in for treatment.\"Dr Mohammed al-Momani says patients are sent back from Jordan after medical treatment to allow authorities to bring in new patients from GazaJordan also treats war wounded at its field hospital in Gaza and has supplied aid via air drops and road convoys. The kingdom hosts more than 2 million Palestinian refugees, who fled conflicts with Israel since 1948, and 500,000 refugees from other countries, mostly Syrians.Since last March some 300 sick and wounded children and 730 parents and guardians have been brought to Jordan out of 2000 scheduled for treatment. Other countries in the region like the United Arab Emirates and Turkey have treated thousands of sick civilians from Gaza.The specialised formula milk Siwar needs was either not available or in very short supply during the ongoing conflict. In March, Israel imposed a total blockade on aid into Gaza that was lifted partially after 11 weeks. Since the ceasefire there has been a surge in aid deliveries, although the UN and aid agencies say not enough humanitarian supplies are flowing.Siwar's family are trying to get her evacuated once more due to her conditionThe Jordanian authorities gave Siwar's family a supply of 12 cans of the hypoallergenic Neocate formula on their departure for Gaza. However her mother Najwa told us that Israeli officials confiscated much of what they'd been given -  nine of their 12 cans were taken. \"They told us, 'It is forbidden to take more than these cans,'\" said Siwar's mother, Najwa Ashour. \"Even though it is therapeutic milk and they said that treatment is allowed, yet they took them.\"She also said that extra clothing the family had been given in Jordan was taken. \"They searched us from top to bottom. When they saw us wearing clothes over each other [layered] they refused to let us out, and told us, 'You must take off all the clothes, down to one outfit.'\"I asked the Israeli government why the milk formula and clothing were confiscated? They replied that limits were placed on what could be taken back for \"security considerations.\"They said only minimal luggage was allowed and this had been conveyed to the Jordanian authorities and the returning families. \"In cases where the luggage exceeded the approved scope, its entry was denied.\"The WHO has appealed for more countries to offer medical evacuation to patients who cannot get the necessary treatment in Gaza.It has also called on the Israeli government to allow patients to be treated in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank \"which is the most time and cost effective route.\" Israel stopped allowing such evacuations after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.Cogat, the Israeli military bosy in charge of aid, said the process for Gazan residents' departure to third countries had been substantially eased.Siwar's family has been given Neocate milk formula since returning to Gaza. There have also been donations of money, including funds raised from online appeals. Jordanian representatives in Gaza have also visited the family to provide assistance.The Ashours are trying to have Siwar evacuated once more - a process that has begun with the issuing of a permit by Palestinian health officials. It will be managed by the WHO which deals with all evacuation requests from a place the UN calls \"a wasteland\". With additional reporting by Malak Hassouneh, Suha Kawar and Alice Doyard.",

    "body": "The showers and baths keeping data centre tech cool20 hours agoChris BaraniukTechnology ReporterThe Washington Post via Getty ImagesData centres can't function without cooling systemsThey work 24/7 at high speeds and get searingly hot - but data centre computer chips get plenty of pampering. Some of them basically live at the spa. \"We'll have fluid that comes up and [then] shower down, or trickle down, onto a component,\" says Jonathan Ballon, chief executive at liquid cooling firm Iceotope. \"Some things will get sprayed.\"In other cases, the industrious gizmos recline in circulating baths of fluid, which ferries away the heat they generate, enabling them to function at very high speeds, known as \"overclocking\".\"We have customers that are overclocking at all times because there is zero risk of burning out the server,\" says Mr Ballon. He adds that one client, a hotel chain in the US, is planning to use heat from hotel servers to warm guest rooms, the hotel laundry and swimming pool.Without cooling, data centres fall over.In November, a cooling system failure at a data centre in the US sent financial trading tech offline at CME Group, the world's largest exchange operator. The company has since put in place additional cooling capacity to help protect against a repeat of this incident.Currently, demand for data centres is booming, driven partly by the growth of AI technologies. But the huge amounts of energy and water that many of these facilities consume mean that they are increasingly controversial.More than 200 environmental groups in the US recently demanded a moratorium on new data centres in the country. But there are some data centre firms that say they want to reduce their impact.They have another incentive. Data centre computer chips are becoming increasingly powerful. So much so that many in the industry say traditional cooling methods – such as air cooling, where fans constantly blow air over the hottest components – is no longer sufficient for some operations.Mr Ballon is aware of rising controversy around the construction of energy-devouring data centres. \"Communities are pushing back on these projects,\" he says. \"We require significantly less power and water. We don't have any fans whatsoever – we operate silently.\"IceotopeIceotope says its tech can cut the cost of cooling by up to 80%Iceotope says its approach to liquid cooling, which can soothe multiple components in a data centre, not just the processing chips, may reduce cooling-related energy demands by up to 80%.The company's technology uses water to cool down the oil-based fluid that actually interacts with computer tech. But the water remains in a closed loop, so there is no need to continually draw more of it from local supplies.I ask whether the oil-based fluids in the firm's cooling system are derived from fossil fuel products and he says some of them are, though he stresses that none contain PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, which are harmful to human health.Some liquid-based data centre cooling technologies use refrigerants that do contain PFAS. Not only that, many refrigerants produce highly potent greenhouse gases, which threaten to exacerbate climate change.Two-phase cooling systems use such refrigerants says Yulin Wang, a former senior technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research firm. The refrigerant starts out as a liquid but heat from server components causes it to evaporate into a gas and this phase change soaks up a lot of energy, meaning it is an effective way of cooling things down.In some designs, data centre tech is fully immersed in large quantities of PFAS-containing refrigerant. \"Vapours can get out of the tank,\" adds Mr Wang. \"There could be some safety issues.\" In other cases, the refrigerant is piped directly to the hottest components, computer chips, only.Some companies that offer two-phase cooling are currently switching to PFAS-free refrigerants.Yulin WangYulin Wang warns of safety issues with some cooling chemicalsOver the years, firms have experimented with wildly different approaches to cooling, in a race to find the best means of keeping data centre gadgets happy.Microsoft famously sank a tube-like container full of servers into the sea off Orkney, for example. The idea was that cold Scottish seawater would improve the efficiency of air-based cooling systems inside the device.Last year, Microsoft confirmed that it had shuttered the project. But the company had learned much from it, says Alistair Speirs, general manager of global infrastructure in the Microsoft Azure business group. \"Without [human] operators, less things went wrong – that informed some of our operational procedures,\" he says. Data centres that are more hands-off appear more reliable.Initial findings showed the subsea data centre had a power usage effectiveness, or PUE, rating of 1.07 – suggesting it was far more efficient than the vast majority of land-based data centres. And it required zero water.But in the end, Microsoft concluded that the economics of building and maintaining subsea data centres weren't very favourable.The company is still working on liquid-based cooling ideas, including microfluidics, where tiny channels of liquid flow through the many layers of a silicon chip. \"You can think of a liquid cooling maze through the silicon at nanometre scale,\" says Mr Speirs.Researchers are coming up with other ideas, too.In July, Renkun Chen, at the University of California San Diego, and colleagues, published a paper detailing their idea for a pore-filled membrane-based cooling technology that could help to cool chips passively – without the need to actively pump fluids or blow air around.\"Essentially, you are using heat to provide the pumping power,\" says Prof Chen. He compares it to the process by which water evaporates from a trees' leaves, inducing a pumping effect that draws more water up through the plant's trunk and along its branches to replenish the leaves. Prof Chen says he hopes to commercialise the technology.New ways of cooling down data centre tech are increasingly sought-after, says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a machine learning company. This is partly due to demand for AI – including generative AI, or large language models (LLMs), which are the systems that power chat bots. In previous research, Dr Luccioni has shown that such technologies eat up lots of energy.\"If you have models that are very energy-intensive, then the cooling has to be stepped up a notch,\" she says.Reasoning models, which explain their output in multiple steps, are even more demanding, she adds.They use \"hundreds or thousands of times more energy\" than standard chat bots that just answer questions. Dr Luccioni calls for greater transparency from AI companies regarding how much energy their various products consume.For Mr Ballon, LLMs are just one form of AI – and he argues they have already \"reached their limit\" in terms of productivity.More Technology of Business",

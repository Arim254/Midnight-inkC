    "body": "23 hours agoTiffanie TurnbullSydneyGetty ImagesThe erotic age-gap novel sexually objectifies children, a judge has saidAn Australian author has been found guilty of creating child sex abuse material in the form of an erotic age-gap romance novel.A New South Wales (NSW) court heard the book explores a relationship between 18-year-old Lucy and her father's 45-year-old best friend Arthur - detailing the much-older man's desires which began when the protagonist was a child as well as passages where she roleplays as a toddler.Lauren Mastrosa, a marketing executive for a Christian charity, was charged after the book sparked outrage online but in court she argued Lucy is clearly identified as an adult in the novel.However, Magistrate Bree Chisholm on Tuesday found Mastrosa's story \"sexually objectifies children\".Mastrosa, 34, issued an advance release of the novel - which the BBC has chosen not to name - to 21 readers in March last year before a complaint about its content was made to police.Chisholm read the whole book, published under the pen name Tori Woods, and found a reasonable reader would find it \"undeniably offensive\".Throughout the novel - the cover of which is pastel pink with the title spelled out in children's alphabet blocks - the protagonist uses child-like language, wears children's clothing, and engages in child-like behaviour.Chisholm said any references to the character being 18 were insufficient to overcome the implication of her as a child.\"Importantly, those descriptions and language are used in the portions of the book to describe a character similar to a young child when the sexual activity is occurring,\" Chisholm said, according to the Australian Associated Press.\"The reader is left with a description that creates the visual image in one's mind of an adult male engaging in sexual activity with a young child.\"Found guilty of one count each of creating, possessing and distributing child abuse material, Mastrosa will return to court to be sentenced on 28 April.When Mastrosa was charged, BaptistCare told the Daily Telegraph she had been stood down from her role pending an investigation.",

    "body": "22 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesSinger Chappell Roan says she has left the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman, whose name appears in the Epstein files.Announcing her split with the agency, Roan said she has a \"duty to protect her team\" and her decision reflected her belief that \"meaningful change in our industry requires accountability\".Wasserman has been criticised after his flirtatious emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, sent in 2003, were revealed among the millions of files published in relation to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Roan made no mention of Epstein, nor the Epstein files, in her statement on Instagram announcing her departure.\"As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,\" she said. Roan added: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\" The BBC has reached out to Wasserman for comment.Wasserman is also the chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, and has faced calls to step down from the position following the release of the emails.He said in a statement that his correspondence with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Who is in the Epstein files?Wasserman also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" he said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Roan's announcement comes after two other bands represented by Wasserman released statements indicating they wanted to distance themselves from his agency.Wednesday, a self-described indie rock band, said they were \"aghast\" to see Wasserman feature in the Epstein files and did not want to continue to be associated with him. They said that they hoped he would step down \"for the sake of his staff\".Rock band Beach Bunny said they were \"hugely disappointed and disgusted\" that Wasserman \"had involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondentBenoit Pavan/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty ImagesGrenoble prosecutor Etienne Manteaux (left) said the unusual decision had been made to name the suspect so potential victims could come forwardAn elderly French man has been charged with the rape and sexual assault of 89 teenagers in a mass abuse case that police allege spans many countries and dates back to the 1960s.Jacques Leveugle, 79, who is in custody in south-east France, was arrested after his nephew found a USB that allegedly detailed his \"sexual relations\" with minors aged 13 to 17, the Grenoble prosecutor, Etienne Manteaux, told a news conference.In an unusual move, authorities are naming the suspect because out of the 89 assaults, Manteaux said that only around 40 victims had been identified.\"If victims wish to come forward, now is the time,\" he added.Police allege the crimes took place between 1967 and 2022. Throughout much of his life, Leveugle worked as an informal teacher or assistant at holiday camps, the prosecutor said.A timeline released of Leveugle's whereabouts dating back to the 1960s shows his appearance throughout the decades. Police allege that he could have carried out assaults not only in France, but also Germany, Switzerland, Morocco, Niger, Algeria, the Philippines, India, Colombia, and the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.\"He travelled to these different countries and in each of these places where he settled to provide tutoring and teach, he would meet young people and have sexual relations with them,\" Manteaux told the news conference on Tuesday.Gendarmerie NationaleLeveugle was arrested in 2024 after visiting his brother in the Isère department around Grenoble, a city in south-eastern France. At the time, Leveugle was living in Morocco.His brother's son - who had suspicions about his uncle - took advantage of his absence one day in October 2023 to examine a USB drive that belonged to Leveugle. It allegedly contained \"15 tomes of very dense material\" - photographs and written accounts of his \"sexual relations\" with minors, Manteaux said.\"The victims we have spoken to tell us that he spent a lot of time helping them to learn foreign languages, awakening their sense of culture... He has a complex personality,\" the prosecutor said.\"A lot of work has been done to identify all the victims. But in his journal, some only have first names, and there we found ourselves up against a wall. That's why we decided to launch this appeal - and also in case there are other victims not listed in his journal,\" Manteaux added.The prosecutor revealed that under questioning, Leveugle also allegedly admitted to killing his own mother and aunt by smothering them with cushions.He is accused of killing his mother in 1974 when she was in the terminal phase of cancer, and he allegedly did the same to his 92-year-old aunt in 1992.\"He explained to us that he told (his aunt) he had to leave for the Cévennes. She was pleading with him not to go, so he took the decision to kill her too,\" the prosecutor said.\"He justifies the killings by saying he hoped someone would do the same to him if he was in the same situation at the end of his life.\"A separate judicial investigation has been opened into these alleged killings.Under French law, alleged assaults that took place before 1993 come under the country's statute of limitations, so no prosecutions for them would be possible. However Manteaux said it was still important to get a full picture of Leveugle's alleged crimes.In two other recent and high-profile sexual assault cases in France, offenders kept records of their activities which were later key in bringing them to justice. In the Pélicot rape case,  Dominique Pélicot kept videos of men assaulting his sleeping wife Gisèle, whom he had drugged. He was jailed for 20 years.In Brittany, former doctor Joêl Le Scouarnec compiled detailed computer records of the hundreds of children he molested in hospital. Without this evidence, he may never have been convicted. He, too, was jailed for 20 years.",

    "body": "16 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterGetty ImagesSinger Marc Anthony has described the Beckham family rift as \"extremely unfortunate\", but added that the way it has played out is \"hardly the truth\".The 57-year-old performed at Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz Beckham's wedding reception in 2022, and is a close friend of the wider family. But Brooklyn recently said the way the couple's first dance was handled at the wedding left him feeling \"uncomfortable and humiliated\", after Anthony reportedly called for him to dance with his mother instead of his wife. Beckham added that his mother then danced \"very inappropriately\" on him. Sir David and Lady Beckham have not commented since Brooklyn published his statement. \"I've known them since before the kids were born. I'm godfather to Cruz. I'm really close to the family. But I have nothing to say about what happened there.\"He added: \"It's extremely unfortunate how it's playing out - but [how it's playing out] is hardly the truth.\"Getty ImagesMarc Anthony is a long-term friend of the Beckham family and godfather to Cruz (pictured in 2023)He accused his parents of trying to \"ruin my relationship\" with Peltz, adding that he had no wish to reconcile with his family.The 26-year-old also said his mother had \"hijacked\" his first dance with Peltz, which had been \"planned weeks in advance to a romantic love song\".\"In front of our 500 wedding guests,\" he continued, \"Marc Anthony called me to the stage, where in the schedule was planned to be my romantic dance with my wife but instead my mum was waiting to dance with me instead.\"\"She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.\"After speculation about the nature of Lady Beckham's dancing, Fat Tony clarified: \"There was no slut-dropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action.\"Fat Tony claimed Marc Anthony had called for \"the most beautiful woman in the room\" to come up for the first dance with Brooklyn, but then said Lady Beckham's name instead of Nicola's. The DJ said this led to the bride running out of the room in tears.Sir David and Lady Beckham have not responded to repeated requests for comment on the claims in their eldest son's statementHowever, when asked about young people and their social media use in Davos last month, Sir David remarked that children are \"allowed to make mistakes\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoAmy WalkerGetty ImagesVenezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has returned home after being captured by security forces on Sunday - but is under house arrest, his son has said.Ramón Guanipa said while his family was \"relieved\", his father remained \"unjustly imprisoned\". The country's opposition leader María Corina Machado said on Sunday that Guanipa had been taken in the capital Caracas by \"heavily armed men\". It came hours after Guanipa and other political prisoners were released.Venezuela's Interior and Justice Minister Diosdado Cabello later said \"a person\" was rearrested \"for violating the conditions under which he was released\".\"Some politicians believed they could do whatever they wanted,\" Cabello added on Monday.A former vice-president of the National Assembly, Guanipa spent eight months in prison and is among several political prisoners to have been freed since the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in January.In an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, Ramón said his father, leader of the Justice First party, had initially been released from prison at about 11:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Sunday.He said his father then spent time with families waiting for the release of other political prisoners.\"He made some statements, he mobilised a lot of people,\" Ramón said, continuing: \"He went on an interview... and after that he was kidnapped by security forces that weren't wearing uniform, that weren't identified properly.\"During the BBC interview, Guanipa's son said he had been informed that his father would be returned and placed under house arrest. But he said no further information was shared about when his father would be transported.Later on Tuesday, Ramón posted on his father's X account, saying: \"I confirm that my father, Juan Pablo Guanipa, is at our home in Maracaibo. We are relieved to know that our family will soon be together.\"He added: \"My father remains unjustly imprisoned, because house arrest is still imprisonment, and we demand his full freedom, as well as the freedom of all political prisoners.\"Ramón thanked the US government, including President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for \"their efforts in support of freedom in Venezuela and for all political prisoners\".'He mobilised a lot of people', says Guanipa's sonGuanipa's centre-right party had previously said the 61-year-old was kidnapped by the \"repressive forces of the dictatorship\" while he was moving between locations.It added that those accompanying him warned that weapons were pointed at the group before Guanipa was loaded into a car.\"We hold Delcy Rodríguez, Jorge Rodríguez, and Diosdado Cabello responsible for any harm to Juan Pablo's life,\" Justice First wrote on social media, referring to Venezuela's interim president, the National Assembly speaker, and the interior minister respectively.The party also called on the international community to demand Guanipa's \"immediate release\", as well as an end to the Venezuelan government's \"persecution of the opposition\".When Guanipa was recaptured on Sunday, Ramón and a key figure in Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, had demanded proof of life.Guanipa, a political ally of Machado, was among at least 30 people freed on Sunday, according to Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in the country.He was elected governor of the Zulia region in 2017, but barred from taking office after refusing to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.He then went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 election result.Guanipa was later tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025.Opposition and human rights groups say the government under Maduro had for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.",

    "body": "23 hours agoJoel GuintoandVirma SimonetteGetty ImagesThe Philippine Supreme Court in a landmark decision has ruled that same-sex couples can be considered co-owners of property.Applying a provision of the country's Family Code for the first time, the court said same-sex couples can be recognised as co-owners if it is proven that both parties contributed to acquiring a property.Same-sex unions are outlawed in conservative Catholic Philippines and it is the only country in the world, outside of the Vatican, that does not allow divorce.This has left LGBT couples without legal protections when it comes to property, finance and healthcare.The Supreme Court ruling, which was made public on Tuesday, involved a former couple - two women - who had feuded over plans to sell their house and lot in suburban Manila.One of the women refused to sell their house after initially agreeing to do so, leading the other to file a claim before a lower court asking to divide their property. The lower court denied the claim, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.But the Supreme Court on 5 February reversed the lower court rulings. It cited a document made by one partner - and acknowledged by the other - that she paid 50% of the purchase and renovation costs.The property was registered under the name of only one of the partners to make the paperwork during the acquisition faster, since they were not married or related by blood.While the Family Code defines marriage as a bond between a man and a woman, the court said Article 148 - which governs \"property relations of people who live together but cannot legally marry\" - does not discriminate based on gender and \"applies to all forms of co-habitation\".Article 148 applies to same-sex couples, \"otherwise, we render legally invisible some forms of legitimate intimate relationships\", said Associate Justice Marvic Leonen.Associate Justice Amy Lazaro Javier further noted that Article 148 must not be limited to heterosexual couples \"given the prevailing values in modern society as well as the glaring yet unjustified difference in the treatment of heterosexual couples vis-à-vis their homosexual counterparts\".A spokesperson for the Supreme Court, Camille Ting, confirmed to the BBC that it is the first time Article 148 of the Family Code has been used to decide on a case regarding property rights of a same-sex couple.The court in its decision also called on government and lawmakers to address the needs of same-sex couples.\"With the political, moral, and cultural questions that surround the issue concerning the rights of same-sex couples, political departments especially the Congress must be involved to quest for solutions,\" the court said.",

    "body": "1 day agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesAward-winning actress Catherine O'Hara died of a pulmonary embolism, her death certificate in the US has revealed. O'Hara died on 30 January in a Los Angeles hospital, at the age of 71. In addition to the blood clot in her lungs, the death certificate listed rectal cancer as the long-term cause of death. It was indicated that she had been receiving treatment for the cancer since March 2025. Tributes have poured in for the Canadian actress, who most recently appeared in the Emmy-winning comedy The Studio and The Last of Us.O'Hara rememberedActor and The Studio creator Seth Rogen said he was devastated by O'Hara's death, describing the actress as \"hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous\". \"We're all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it,\" he said.Actor Pedro Pascal, who worked with O'Hara on The Last of Us, wrote on Instagram: \"Oh, genius to be near you. Eternally grateful. There is less light in my world, this lucky world that had you, will keep you, always.\"The actress starred in six seasons of comedy series Schitt's Creek, for which she won an Emmy for best comedy actress. Show creator and co-star Eugene Levy told People magazine that he has had the \"honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O'Hara for over fifty years\".\"Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today,\" he said. Co-creator Dan Levy, who played O'Hara's son David, described her as \"family before she ever played my family\".He added on Instagram that he would \"cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her\".O'Hara's on-screen son in holiday classics Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, Macaulay Culkin, also paid an emotional tribute on Instagram.\"Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you,\" he wrote.\"I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later.\"O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch, her sons Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings.What is a pulmonary embolism?According to the NHS, a pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood vessel in the lungs is blocked by a blood clot.Symptoms include a sudden difficulty in breathing, chest pain that increases when breathing and coughing up blood.

    "body": "3 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: Buddhist monks' Walk for Peace nears end in Washington DCA band of Buddhist monks who have spent four months walking - sometimes barefoot or through the snow - on a 2,000-mile march from Texas to Washington DC completed their journey on Tuesday. The group's arduous so-called Walk of Peace has gone viral, capturing the attention of millions of Americans at a time of heightened political division in the US.Along the way, the troupe has shared a message of mindfulness, with its leader, the Venerable Bhikkhu Pannakara, saying: \"My hope is, when this walk ends, the people we met will continue practicing mindfulness and find peace.\" Their journey began on 26 October 2025 at the Huong Dao Vipassana Bhavana Center in Fort Worth.Getty ImagesAfter arriving in the US Capital, the monks visited the Washington National Cathedral where they attended an interfaith service. Later in the week, they will make stops at the Abraham Lincoln Memorial and the Peace Monument, which stands on the US Capitol grounds.The group also reportedly plans to appeal to lawmakers to declare Buddha's birthday - called Vesak - a national holiday - but their expedition has gained traction beyond this policy request.\"Their long journey and gentle witness invite us all to deepen our commitment to compassion,\" said Washington Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde, who will help host the monks at an interfaith reception, according to the Associated Press.The 19 travelling monks are from Theravada Buddhist monasteries around the globe.The final day of their single-file trek across the country began on Tuesday morning in Arlington, Virginia, roughly five miles (9.1km) outside the US capitol. A livestream on the group's Facebook account shows them walking past piles of snow, as the first days of above-freezing temperatures return after weeks of record cold across much of the eastern United States. They are cheered on by rows of onlookers in the video.\"May you be safe and warm. Thank you for your walk of peace. We desperately need this in our world now,\" one user wrote. For the last 108 days - a sacred number in Buddhism representing spiritual completion - the group has walked this same single-file line step by step. But the trip has not been without incident. In November, an escort vehicle that accompanied the monks as they walked alongside a highway in Houston, Texas was hit by a truck, injuring two of the monks. One of them had his leg amputated. Their return to Texas is likely to be quicker - and easier - as they are expected to commute back via bus, arriving in Fort Worth on Saturday. ",

    "body": "18 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisAFP via Getty ImagesEmmanuel Macron warned that \"today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder\"French President Emmanuel Macron has urged Europe to assert itself on the world stage, saying it is time to start acting like a \"power\".In the face of growing threats from China, Russia and now the US, he told a group of European newspapers that the continent faced a \"wake-up call\".\"Are we ready to become a power? This is the question in the field of economy and finance, in defence and security, and in our democratic systems. \"In another era we might have said it is the moment to 'assume our majority',\" he said ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later this week.Macron repeated his call for EU-wide mutualised loans in order to raise hundreds of billions of euros needed for industrial investment.\"The time has come to launch a shared debt capacity to fund our future expense -  eurobonds for the future. We need big European programmes to finance the best projects,\" he said.Similar calls in the past have met scepticism from Germany and other countries, who feel France wants to use Europe to bear a financial burden which it alone - because of its failure to reform - is unable to take up.Macron admitted that France \"has never had a balanced model, unlike certain economies of the north, which are built more on a sense of responsibility. \"And we have never had reforms like the ones initiated in the 2010s in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece, which are paying dividends today.\"But he said there was growing demand in the world's financial markets for mutualised European debt, which currently the EU was not equipped to supply.\"The world markets are increasingly afraid of the American greenback [dollar]. They want alternatives… \"For investors everywhere a democratic state of law is a huge attraction. And when I look at the world as it is, we have the authoritarian regime that is China, and on the other side we have the US distancing itself further and further from a state of law.\"According to Macron, the 27-member EU needs €1,2tn (£1tn; $1.4tn) a year to invest in the vital sectors of security and defence, clean energy, and artificial intelligence.Calling on the EU to \"protect\" these and other industries, he said: \"The Chinese do it, the Americans too.  Europe today is the most open market in the world.\"In the face of that, I am not saying we should be protectionist. It's more a question of being coherent - in other words not imposing on our own producers rules which we do not impose on non-Europeans.\"\"Today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder,\" he said.\"Climate change is accelerating. The US – which we thought would guarantee our security for ever – is no longer sure. Russia was to give us cheap energy for ever, but that stopped three years ago. China... has become a rival that gets fiercer and fiercer.\"Today, we Europeans are on our own. But we have each other. We are 450 million people. It's huge. For me [becoming a power] is the fulfilment of the European adventure.\"We came together to stop war, we came together to build a market. But we always forbade ourselves to think of power.\"Asked about the latest stand-off with Washington over Greenland, at the end of which US President Donald Trump appeared to back down from threats to annex the Danish territory,  Macron said the Europeans should not be fooled.\"At the end of a crisis, there is a cowardly tendency to sit back and say 'phew'. There are threats and intimidation, and then suddenly Washington gives way. And people think it's over.\"Don't believe it for a single second,\" the French leader said.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJessica MurphyWatch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homeThe FBI has released images of a masked person in the hunt for news anchor Savannah Guthrie's mother.Officials are seeking to identify the individual, who they say was armed, more than  eight days after 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home.Savannah Guthrie said on Tuesday her family believes their mother is still alive and issued a new appeal to anyone with information.Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her Tucson, Arizona, home and was last seen on 31 January. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.\"As of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement on X.He said authorities had been working to recover images from the home surveillance system that \"may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors - including the removal of recording devices\".  Officials also released two short videos showing the person approach the front door of Nancy Guthrie's home, then check the camera before moving away, picking up some vegetation from the ground and using it to cover the camera lens. Savannah Guthrie shared the new video on Instagram. \"Someone out there recognises this person,\" she said on Tuesday. \"We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.\"It marks the first major breakthrough in a case that has gripped the country.On Monday, police were still saying they had yet to identify any suspects or vehicles connected to Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, the same day that Savannah Guthrie issued a new video appeal to anyone with information.\"We believe our mum is still out there,\" she said in a video posted to her Instagram account. \"We need your help.\"It was the fourth video appeal released by the family in recent days, including one indicating they would be willing to pay for their mother's safe return.Police have said Nancy Guthrie needs daily medication and has limited mobility. The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for information in the case.FBIFBIWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Donald Trump has reviewed the footage. She said he encouraged people with any information to contact authorities. \"The prayers of this entire White House are with Savannah and her family at this time,\" she said. \"We hope this person is found soon and her mother is brought home safely.\"Last week, Pima County officials said the home's doorbell camera was disconnected at 01:47 local time and the camera's software had registered motion a short time after, at 02:12.At 02:28, the app on her pacemaker, an implanted cardiac device, disconnected from her phone.Police also said they had found blood on Nancy Guthrie's porch and analyses confirmed it was hers.Authorities have said there were taking seriously an email with a ransom note, sent to US media outlets and stating a Monday deadline, the BBC's US partner CBS reported.A previous apparent deadline for ransom, which was demanded in Bitcoin, passed on 5 February.It was one of three reported ransom notes sent in the case. Officials made one arrest last week in relation to a hoax ransom note. The doorbell camera at Guthrie's home has been identified in images as a Nest product, which is part of Google Home's range of devices.While law enforcement officials initially said that video of the incident was not available because Guthrie lacked a subscription for recorded video access, it appears that Google was able to pull footage from the doorbell around the time of her disappearance.Even without a paid subscription to Google Home, most owners of a Nest camera or doorbell have access to a live-stream of video, as well as up to three hours of imagery or footage of any incident captured by their device.A subscription allows a user to access weeks of recorded video from their doorbell camera.Given these functionalities, a Nest doorbell camera is essentially equipped to record constantly.In its privacy policy, and in a guide to security of its Nest products, Google says that video footage is sent to the company from all devices that have the camera turned on.Google did not respond to emails seeking comment on whether it had provided the footage in response to a warrant from investigators.It is unclear why this footage was not released sooner.Additional reporting by Kali Hays",

    "body": "Bid launched to extend Zimbabwe president's term in office9 hours agoShingai NyokaHarareGetty ImagesEmmerson Mnangagwa, once Robert Mugabe's deputy, is due to step down in 2028Zimbabwe's cabinet has approved draft legislation that would allow President Emmerson Mnangagwa, 83, to extend his stay in office until at least 2030.Presidents would be chosen by MPs rather than in a direct vote and could serve a maximum of two seven-year terms, rather than the current five-year terms, under the proposals.Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi said public consultations would be held before the bill heads to parliament for debate, where both chambers are dominated by the ruling Zanu-PF party.Legal challenges are likely as constitutional experts argue a referendum is needed if term limits are changed - and also point out that such amendments cannot benefit a sitting president.Mnangagwa, who first came to power in 2017 after a military coup ousted long-time leader Robert Mugabe, won a presidential election the next year and a second term in 2023 - though the results were disputed.Known as \"the crocodile\" because of his political cunning, his final five-year term is due to expire in 2028.In a referendum held 13 years ago, Zimbabweans overwhelmingly voted for a new constitution that introduced presidential term limits when Mugabe's grip on power seemed entrenched - he had ruled the country since independence in 1980.Hints that Mnangagwa, who was once Mugabe's deputy until they fell out over the growing political ambitions of the then-first lady, wanted to stay in power beyond 2028 started two years ago.The slogan \"2030 he will still be the leader\" began to be chanted at Zanu-PF rallies with his supporters saying he needed to remain in office to complete his \"Agenda 2030\" development programme - though President Mnangagwa publicly rejected the idea.He has faced some fierce detractors within Zanu-PF, but his main critic - Blessed Geza, also known as \"Bombshell\" - died last week.This time last year Geza, a respected veteran of the 1970s war of independence and then member of Zanu-PF's powerful central committee, had launched a scathing attack on Mnangagwa's ambition to stay in power.He apologised for helping him come into office and accused the president of nepotism in his bid to stay in office beyond 2028.Zanu-PF expelled Geza from the party for disloyalty and he was forced into hiding.Yet he continued to attract a large following on social media, where he regularly posted videos calling for protests.Hours before his death a message posted on his social media pages urged Zimbabweans to carry forward the \"noble war\" to remove President Mnangagwa and \"end the plunder of our country\".He was in South Africa when his family announced his death on Friday.\"At a time when silence would have been easier, he chose to speak out against corruption and nepotism that continue to undermine the promise of independence,\" Andrease Ethan Mathibela, national chairman of the influential Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, said.The government is now forging forward with its 2030 plans for Mnangagwa and says the intention behind the draft law is to strengthen governance and bring political stability.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Kenya to confront Russia over 'unacceptable' use of its nationals in combat12 hours agoPeter Mwangangi,BBC Swahili, NairobiandNatasha BootyUkraine Defence IntelligenceClinton Mogesa, 29, died while fighting for RussiaKenya says it will talk to Russia over growing reports that its citizens are being recruited to fight in the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the BBC, Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi called the practice \"unacceptable and clandestine\", and said Nairobi had shut down illegal recruiters and would urge Moscow to sign a deal banning the conscription of Kenyan soldiers.The Kenyan government estimates that around 200 of its nationals have been recruited to fight for Russia. The exact number remains unclear, as Nairobi maintains that none of them travelled through official channels.\"Kenya and Russia have had long relations since independence, literally. So this, in my view, becomes a very unfortunate episode of otherwise very positive and cordial relations between our two countries,\" he added.Mudavadi has told the BBC that Kenya's engagement with Russia will focus on curbing illegal recruitment practices, including discussions on visa policy and bilateral labour agreements excluding military conscription.He said the Kenyan authorities had closed more than 600 recruitment agencies suspected of duping Kenyans with promises of jobs overseas.So far 27 Kenyans who had been fighting in Russia have been repatriated, he said, with authorities providing psychological care to address their trauma and \"de-radicalise\" them.\"Families that we've spoken to say they have not been able to bury their loved ones because their bodies are still on the other end,\" Kenya's foreign minister said. \"It is difficult because, remember, it depends on where the body has been found. There some have been found in Ukraine - we are also working with the government of Ukraine to try and get the remains of those people repatriated.\"Pressure has been mounting on the Kenyan government to act after the recent discovery of more bodies of citizens who had been recruited to fight for Russian armed forces.Some of the affected families have told the BBC that they lay the blame squarely on Kenya's government, for failing to regulate and criminalise clandestine recruitment agencies.But the Kenyan foreign minister rejects this.\"You cannot blame the government on this,\" Mudavadi told the BBC. \"Where there are illegal recruitment agencies, we have scrapped them and we continue to scrap them.\"Ukrainian intelligence assessment estimates that more than 1,400 people from 36 countries in Africa have been recruited to fight for Russia. Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.On Tuesday, the South African government said Russian President Vladimir Putin had pledged to help return South African nationals who had travelled to Ukraine to join Russian troops.This was discussed during a phone call between Putin and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, officials say, with both leaders agreeing their governments will continue working together to finalise the process.At least 17 South African men are reported to be on the front lines of the conflict.Additional reporting by Nobuhle Simelane and Basillioh RukangaYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "18 hours agoNick EdserBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesBP has reported a drop in annual profits and increased its target for cost cutting as the oil giant was hit by the fall in crude prices last year.It reported profits of $7.5bn (£5.5bn) in 2025, down from $8.9bn the year before, after the price of oil fell by about 20%.BP also said it was suspending its share buyback programme and cutting spending as it seeks to strengthen its finances.The company has recently switched strategy away from investment in renewable energy projects to refocus on oil and gas operations, and new boss Meg O'Neill, who takes up her position in April, is expected to continue this trend.O'Neill, formerly head of Australian oil and gas firm Woodside Energy, will be the the first woman to run a major global oil firm.Carol Howle, BP's current interim chief executive, said the company looked forward to O'Neill's arrival \"as we accelerate our progress to build a simpler, stronger and more valuable BP for the future\".The company has come under pressure from its shareholders for underperforming compared to its rivals in recent years.A year ago, BP announced it was cutting planned investments in renewable energy to spend billions of dollars more a year on its core oil and gas operations.The energy giant is trying to cut its debts, which currently stand at about $22bn.Announcing its latest results, BP said it aimed to make cost savings of $5.5bn-$6.5bn by the end of 2027. This is an increase from its previous target of up to $5bn, and comes after its decision to sell a 65% stake in its Castrol business.\"Management is taking some decisive action to fix the balance sheet, scrapping the buyback, doubling down on non-core disposals and upping structural cost-savings targets,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.Profits in the final three months of the year fell 30% to $1.54bn, in a period when the price of Brent crude oil fell below $60 a barrel for the first time in more than four years.BP's annual profits have now fallen for three years in a row. They peaked at $27.7bn in 2022 when oil prices soared in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Rival oil giant Shell also announced a fall in profits when it posted its annual results last week. Shell reported underlying earnings of $18.53bn for 2025, a 22% fall on the previous year.ReutersMeg O'Neill will take up her new role in AprilO'Neill takes over at BP at a difficult time for the oil giant. Its previous boss, Murray Auchincloss, stepped down after less than two years in the job.He had replaced Bernard Looney, who was dismissed by BP in 2023 after he was found to have committed \"serious misconduct\" in failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.Cornelia Meyer, chief executive of Meyer Resources and a former BP executive, told the BBC that O'Neill had \"a stellar track record\", and when it comes to reviving BP's fortunes, \"if anybody can, she probably can\".She added O'Neill would \"instil discipline\", noting \"she's an oil woman, she's not a renewables woman\".However, BP is facing questions from some groups over its recent investment decisions.Nick Mazan from ACCR, the shareholder advocacy and research organisation that has tabled the resolution, said by halting its share buyback and continuing to invest in oil and gas, \"BP doesn't appear to have shareholder interests at heart\".\"While the pivot back to oil and gas has been justified by scapegoating the low carbon business, our analysis shows that the upstream business has been the source of 75% of disposal losses and impairments since 2020.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoMadeline HalpertGetty ImagesTrump was once friendly with Epstein but says he cut off ties before Epstein's first criminal convictionA former Florida police chief said he received a call from Donald Trump in 2006 in which the now-president told him \"everyone\" knows about Jeffrey Epstein’s behaviour, according to an FBI document released by the justice department.The document is a written record of a 2019 FBI interview with the former Palm Beach police chief, who alleges Trump called him after the department launched an investigation into Epstein and said: \"Thank goodness you're stopping him, everyone has known he's been doing this.\"The officer's name is redacted, but the document identifies the interview subject as the Palm Beach police chief at the time of its Epstein investigation. That was Michael Reiter, who told the Miami Herald that he received the call from Trump.The president has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and has said he did not know about his crimes. The alleged call, however, is likely to raise further questions about what Trump knew and when.Asked by reporters in 2019 - when Epstein was arrested by federal agents for sex trafficking - if he had \"any suspicions\" about the disgraced financier, Trump said: \"No, I had no idea. I had no idea. I haven't spoken to him in many, many years.\"Watch: Trump call with police chief \"may or may not have\" happened, Leavitt saysAccording to the FBI summary of the interview, which was released in the latest tranche of Epstein files, Reiter said Trump told him in a July 2006 call that he had thrown Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club and \"people in New York knew he was disgusting\". Reiter also claims Trump told him Ghislaine Maxwell was Epstein's \"operative\", and \"she is evil and to focus on her\".Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in luring underage girls for Epstein.Reiter also told the FBI that Trump said he was around Epstein when he was with teenagers and that he \"got the hell out of there\".According to the document, he said Trump was one of the \"very first people to call\" Florida police when he heard they were investigating Epstein. In 2006, Palm Beach police were investigating the disgraced financier for the alleged sexual exploitation of underage girls. The case was later turned over to federal prosecutors, who in 2008 made a controversial plea deal with Epstein that included a non-prosecution agreement that protected him from more serious charges.In a statement to the BBC, a justice department official said: \"We are not aware of any corroborating evidence that the president contacted law enforcement 20 years ago.\"At a briefing on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the reported call and said it \"may or may not have happened in 2006. I don't know the answer.\"\"What President Trump has always said is that he kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club because Jeffrey Epstein was a creep,\" she said. \"And that remains true in this call. If it did happen it corroborates exactly what President Trump has said from the beginning.\"The BBC has also contacted Reiter for comment.Trump and Epstein socialised and appeared in photographs together in the 1990s, but the president and the White House have repeatedly said he was in the dark about Epstein's crimes before he broke off contact with him in around 2004 - years before he was first arrested.Trump has said their falling out came after he learned Epstein had been trying to \"steal\" his employees from Mar-a-Lago.\"When I heard about it, I told him, we don't want you taking our people,\" Trump said in July. \"He was fine and then not too long after that he did it again and I said 'outta here'.\"Reports of the alleged call came after Maxwell - who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein - testified virtually before the US House Oversight Committee on Monday.During the closed-door deposition, Maxwell refused to answer questions and pleaded the Fifth Amendment, invoking her right to remain silent, Oversight Committee chairman James Comer said.Maxwell's lawyer claimed she was \"prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump\".Trump has said he has not thought about giving a pardon to Maxwell.Watch: Ghislaine Maxwell repeatedly invokes right to silence during congressional hearing",

    "body": "54 minutes agoNichola Mandil,Juba and Basillioh RukangaSouth Sudan's leader Salva Kiir has in a shock move dismissed one of his vice-presidents, Benjamin Bol Mel, who had been tipped as his possible successor.Kiir stripped Bol Mel of his military rank of general and dismissed him from the national security service. He also sacked the central bank governor and the head of the revenue authority, both considered close allies of Bol Mel.No explanation was given for the dismissals, which were announced in a decree broadcast on state television.It comes when there are growing fears of political instability and a possible return to civil war, after the recent collapse of a fragile power-sharing agreement between Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar.Bol Mel, 47, was only appointed vice-president in February, replacing James Wani Igga, a veteran politician and general. He was also elevated to become the first deputy chairman of the ruling SPLM  party, which analysts believe gave him more powers and positioned him as a potential successor to the 74-year-old Kiir. The president later promoted him to the full rank of a general in the National Security Service (NSS).Bol Mel's promotion came despite the US placing sanctions against him for alleged corruption in 2017, which were renewed earlier this year. The US Treasury described Bol Mel as Kiir's \"principal financial advisor\". Kiir's office denied the description.Bol Mel has never directly responded to the corruption accusations against him and has not commented on his sacking.The president has not announced replacements in any of the positions he held.His dismissal follows speculation on social media about an internal power struggle in the SPLM.A senior government official, who preferred to remain anonymous for safety reasons, told the BBC that Bol Mel had been a \"divisive figure\" in government. \"It's good that he has gone,\" he said.A taxi driver in the capital, Juba, also welcomed the dismissal.\"Everybody hates this man. Even in his home town of Aweil people celebrated his dismissal. We are happy for President Kiir,\" he told the BBC.Hours before Bol Mel's sacking, his security detail was reportedly withdrawn from his residence and office in the capital, Juba.South Sudan is an oil-rich nation that became the world's newest country in 2011 after seceding from Sudan. It was engulfed by civil war two years later, after Kiir and Machar fell out.The 2018 power-sharing agreement that ended the war has been fraught with challenges, as tensions persist and sporadic violence continues to erupt.Planned elections have been postponed twice in the past three years and fighting between forces loyal to the president and armed groups has recently escalated.Machar was sacked as vice-president and arrested earlier this year and in September charged with murder, treason and crimes against humanity in a move seen as aggravating tensions and sparking fears of renewed civil unrest. The case is ongoing.His spokesperson described the charges against him as a \"political witch-hunt\".The charges followed an attack by a militia allegedly linked to Machar, which the government said had killed 250 soldiers and a general.",

    "body": "Some 200 Kenyans are fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine and more could be recruited into the conflict, authorities say. Among them are former members of Kenya's security forces, according to Kenya's Foreign Affairs Minister Musalia Mudavadi. Some of those who have been rescued said they were forced to assemble drones and handle chemicals without proper training or protective gear, the minister added.Kenyan President William Ruto last week requested the Ukrainian government to secure the release of Kenyans currently held in the conflict zone.About 1,400 citizens from across Africa are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, with some recruited through deception, the Ukraine government said last week. A young Kenyan athlete was in September captured in Ukraine and said that he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.\"Recruitment exercises in Russia have reportedly expanded to include African nationals, including Kenyans,\" said Mudavadi in a press conference on Wednesday. \"Over 200 Kenyans may have joined the Russian military... recruitment networks are still active in both Kenya and Russia,\" he added. Kenya's embassy in Moscow has recorded injuries among some of the recruits, who were allegedly promised up to $18,000 (£14,000) to cover costs for visas, travel, and accommodation, the minister said. Mudavadi also said the Kenyan government had concerns about the increasing number of nationals who have been recruited into \"forced criminality\" such as drug trafficking and forced labour in foreign countries. \"These crimes present a serious threat to not only the national security of Kenya but to global security as well.\" In September, Kenyan authorities rescued more than 20 nationals who were preparing to join the Russia-Ukraine war near the capital, Nairobi. One person suspected of coordinating the recruitment of Kenyans to Russia was arrested and is facing prosecution in connection with the scheme.  The BBC has found evidence to suggest the Kremlin is working to expand its sphere of influence in Africa.South Africa recently launched an investigation into how 17 of its citizens ended up in the war-torn region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine.Citizens of Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka , among others, are currently being held in Ukrainian prisoner-of-war camps, Petro Yatsenko, Ukraine's spokesperson on the treatment of prisoners of war, recently told the BBC.Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.",

    "body": "1 hour agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterValve, the company behind PC gaming platform Steam, has revealed a new console to rival Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation.The Steam Machine is a home console designed to allow gamers to play PC games on their TV - though it can also be used as a computer.It is a spiritual sequel to the 2014 device of the same name, which failed to break into a market dominated by the three big gaming giants.Prices for those consoles, back then, started at $499 (£300) - but Valve's latest iteration is expected to cost a good deal more as it packs a far greater punch.The Steam Machine will go on sale in early 2026, the company said, with the pricing yet to be announced.The company says this and more details will be provided closer to the exact release date, which is also currently unknown.In a video announcement, it described the device as \"a powerful gaming PC in a small but mighty package\" - with a decent amount of power inside a 6-inch cube.Valve argues the device is \"optimised for gaming\" over other PCs because the firm is able to say which games on its massive digital storefront will work on it before you buy.Powered by its Linux-based SteamOS operating system and AMD graphics processors, the firm said the new Steam Machine can support 4k resolution and 60 frames per second.In an unusual move, Valve has also announced further hardware - its Steam Frame virtual reality (VR) headset.The device is entirely wireless - and it described it as a \"streaming-first\" device - but it is also itself a PC running SteamOS.And it brings a technical leap forward in the VR space - the headset displays the highest-quality graphics only in the bits of the screen you're looking at.With the sweeping new device announcements, Valve is setting itself up to rival its more established competitors.In recent years, Microsoft-owned Xbox has placed its subscription service Game Pass at the heart of its offering for gamers - some say at the expense of its console crown.Meanwhile the PS5 has been the best-selling console for some time, but fans have been left asking when its successor will appear on the market.Brandon Sutton, games industry analyst at Midia research, said the announcements showed Valve's \"strong grasp of where the gaming market is headed and what gamers want\".\"With Sony and Microsoft moving away from console exclusives, and the prevalence of games streaming services, it has never been a better time for a PC-Console hybrid,\" he told the BBC.Meanwhile industry expert Christopher Dring likened its potential and appeal to that of Valve's handheld Steam Deck console, with its \"lucrative but niche\" audience of \"around four to five million players\".\"Most of those people were already Steam customers looking to take their PC games on-the-go,\" he said.\"My feeling is the Steam Machine will be similar - this will mostly appeal to a lucrative enthusiast audience of existing Steam players who want to play their games in a living room setting.\"Since Valve launched Steam in 2003, it has grown to become the world's largest distribution platform for PC gaming.Around 25 million Steam players were online and six million were playing games at the time of writing, according to the platform's own metrics.",

    "body": "Drugs disguised as tea keep washing up on this S Korean holiday island6 hours agoKelly NgJeju Coast GuardSome 28kg of ketamine, wrapped in foil and labelled with the Chinese character for tea, have been found in the last two monthsSince September, residents on South Korea's Jeju island have been spotting small packs of what appear to be bags of Chinese tea washed ashore. Upon closer inspection, however, they were found to contain ketamine.Some 28kg (62 lbs) of the drug, wrapped in foil and labelled with the Chinese character for tea, have been found on at least eight occasions, police say.Ketamine is used as an anaesthetic in medical procedures, but its recreational use is illegal in South Korea. It can cause severe physical and mental damage, including to the heart and lungs, when misused.The Jeju Coast Guard has formed a team to trace possible sea and land routes through which the drugs may have entered the country.Authorities have also warned residents not to touch or open any suspicious objects found along the shore, asking them to instead report such discoveries to police.On 15 October, a beach cleaner found 20kg of these \"tea bag drugs\" - the largest haul in the last two months - along the coast of Seogwipo in southern Jeju.Earlier this week, a team of more than 800 soldiers, police officers and civilian volunteers was deployed to comb the beaches in Jeju City, along the holiday island's northern coast, Korea JoongAng Daily reported. Investigators are now focusing on the possibility that the drugs drifted to Jeju via ocean currents, according to the national daily.It quoted the head of the Coast Guard's narcotics unit saying that similar discoveries of \"tea bag drugs\" have been made in Pohang, another city in South Korea, and Tsushima island in Japan. News1A team of more than 800 soldiers, police officiers and civilian volunteers was deployed to comb through the beaches in Jeju CityJeju residents have shown concern over the presence of illicit drugs on their coastlines. \"I often bring my children to this beach,\" said Kim, a resident who witnessed the large-scale search effort in Jeju City this week.\"Seeing so many people looking for drugs is terrifying. I shudder to think that children might touch something like that,\" Kim told Korea JoongAng Daily.Another resident, Hyun, wants authorities to focus on \"stopping more [drugs] from drifting in\".Yoon Heung-hee, a professor at Hansung University's drug and alcohol addiction department, suggests a larger syndicate may be behind the ketamine packets. Some syndicates use a \"sea bump\" method to transport narcotics, he said, which involves dropping bundles of drugs equipped with trackers into the ocean for retrieval later.Criminal groups could have sought to smuggle the drugs across South Korea via Jeju by \"taking advantage of lax inspections at airports and ports\", Prof Yoon told The Hankyoreh, another local newspaper.Additional reporting by Suhnwook Lee in Seoul",

    "body": "30 minutes agoNatasha Booty and Tom Bateman,State department correspondent, At the G7 ministers' meetingUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for international action to cut off the supply of weapons to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are accused of mass killings in el-Fasher. At the end of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada, Rubio said the RSF had committed systematic atrocities, including murder, rape and sexual violence against civilians. Sudan's army accuses the United Arab Emirates of propping up the RSF with weapons and mercenaries sent via African nations. The UAE has repeatedly denied these allegations.The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into all-out civil war.It is not clear how much impact Rubio's call will have. A previous US proposal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan has already been violated by the RSF, even though they agreed to it last week.El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF after an 18-month siege, meaning they now control all of the cities in the vast western Darfur region.A fraction of the population has managed to flee the city, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth are visible from space in satellite imagery. Non-Arab groups in the wider Darfur region are being systematically targeted by the RSF in what amounts to genocide, according to the US and humanitarian groups.At the talks near Niagara Falls on Monday, America's top diplomat said women and children had been targeted in acts of the most horrific kind by the RSF in el-Fasher.Rubio told reporters: \"They're committing acts of sexual violence and atrocities, just horrifying atrocities, against women, children, innocent civilians of the most horrific kind.  And it needs to end immediately.\"And we're going to do everything we can to bring it to an end, and we've encouraged partner nations to join us in this fight.\"The secretary of state rejected the paramilitary group's attempt to blame the killings on rogue elements, saying this was false and the attacks were systematic. Asked by the BBC about his assessment of the likely scale of atrocities, he said the US feared that thousands of people who had been expected to flee el-Fasher were either dead or too malnourished to move. He said the RSF, lacking its own arms manufacturing facilities, relied on outside support, and called for countries supplying weapons to stop. The joint G7 statement also condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered \"the world's largest humanitarian crisis\".To date, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have had no choice but to flee their homes.The flow of weapons into the country during this two-year-long civil war has been analysed by various experts.Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, China, Turkey and UAE being used in Sudan.The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - according to a leaked report by UN experts.The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales.All parties deny these allegations.A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities.In response to one MP's demand to \"end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF\", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: \"The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAlmost a year to the day since French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal was arrested on arrival at Algiers airport, the Algerian president has pardoned him and allowed him to leave the country.Sansal, 81, has been at the centre of a bitter diplomatic row between Paris and Algiers and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune's decision came in response to a direct approach from German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.The writer arrived in Germany on a military plane on Wednesday evening and was taken to hospital.French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Sansal by phone, said France had used respect and calm to bring about his freedom.\"I thank President Tebboune for this act of humanity,\" said Macron.Although Paris had for months sought to lower tensions with Algeria, it was the German president's role that secured Sansal's release because of his good relations with Algeria's leader.French ambassador Stéphane Romatet, who was recalled from Algiers earlier this year for consultations because of the row, told French radio on Thursday that the crisis in relations was so deep that \"from the start we knew a happy outcome... would go through a trusted third party and the German solution quickly came forward\".Steinmeier said this week he had asked President Tebboune to pardon Sansal, \"given his advanced age and fragile health\", so the writer could receive medical treatment in Germany.Tebboune said on Wednesday he had decided to respond favourably to Steinmeier's request \"because of its nature and humanitarian motives\". Sansal is being treated for prostate cancer.He was given a five-year jail sentence in July for undermining national unity with remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.The novelist has long been a critic of Algeria's government, which had not responded favourably to France's appeal for clemency.Relations had already been on the slide after President Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.The spat worsened in April when Algeria expressed outrage after one of its consular staff in France was arrested over the kidnapping of a government critic in Paris.The crisis between the two countries was seen as unprecedented in more than 60 years since Algeria secured independence from France in 1962.Some French commentators and political figures blamed what was seen as a confrontational stance to Algeria taken by right-wing former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau and others on the right of French politics.Algerian minister Sofiane Chaib also blamed Retailleau earlier this year for the \"fabricated spat\".Then at the end of last month a motion by France's National Rally was narrowly passed by MPs opposing a 1968 Franco-Algerian migration accord that granted residency rights to Algerians.Although the move was seen as a potential setback, the decision to replace Retailleau with Laurent Nuñez as interior minister appeared to signal a new mood.\"He has completely changed the way relations with [Algeria] are handled\", ex-diplomat Jean-Christophe Ruffin told French radio.Retailleau responded to Sansal's release on Wednesday speaking of \"immense relief and great joy\".Tensions between the two countries remain, though, after French sportswriter Christophe Gleizes was jailed for seven years in July for allegedly trying to interview a member of a movement designed by Algeria as a terrorist group.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot praised diplomats for their work in securing Sansal's release, and said they remained focused on Gleizes, \"whose imminent release we are hoping for\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, WashingtonWatch: Republican and Democratic House leaders on ending government shutdownAfter 43 days, the longest US government shutdown in history is coming to an end.Federal workers will start receiving pay again. National Parks will reopen. Government services that had been curtailed or suspended entirely will resume. Air travel, which had become a nightmare for many Americans, will return to being merely frustrating.After the dust settles and the ink from President Donald Trump's signature on the funding bill dries, what has this record-setting shutdown accomplished? And what has it cost?Senate Democrats, through their use of the parliamentary filibuster, were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber by refusing to go along with a Republican measure to temporarily fund the government.They drew a line in the sand, demanding that the Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year. When a handful of Democrats broke ranks to vote to reopen the government on Sunday, they received next to nothing in return – a promise of a vote in the Senate on the subsidies, but no guarantees of Republican support or even a necessary vote in the House of Representatives.ReutersSince then, members of the party's left flank have been furious. They've accused Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer – who didn't vote for the funding bill – of being secretly complicit in the reopening plan or simply incompetent. They've felt like their party folded even after off-year election success showed they had the upper hand. They feared that the shutdown sacrifices had been for nothing.Even more mainstream Democrats, like California's Governor Gavin Newsom, called the shutdown deal \"pathetic\" and a \"surrender\".\"I'm not coming in to punch anybody in the face,\" he told the Associated Press, \"but I'm not pleased that, in the face of this invasive species that is Donald Trump, who's completely changed the rules of the game, that we're still playing by the old rules of the game.\"Newsom has 2028 presidential ambitions and can be a good barometer for the mood of the party. He was a loyal supporter of Joe Biden who turned out to defend the then-president even after his disastrous June debate performance against Trump.If he is running for the pitchforks, it's not a good sign for Democratic leaders.EPAWatch: Moment House votes to end longest government shutdown in US historyFor Trump, in the days since the Senate deadlock broke on Sunday, his mood has gone from cautious optimism to celebration.On Tuesday, he congratulated congressional Republicans and called the vote to reopen the government \"a very big victory\".\"We're opening up our country,\" he said at a Veteran's Day commemoration at Arlington Cemetery. \"It should have never been closed.\"Trump, perhaps sensing the Democratic anger toward Schumer, joined the pile-on during a Fox News interview on Monday night.\"He thought he could break the Republican Party, and the Republicans broke him,\" Trump said of the Senate Democrat.Although there were times when Trump appeared to be buckling – last week he berated Senate Republicans for refusing to scrap the filibuster to reopen the government – he ultimately emerged from the shutdown having made little in the way of substantive concessions.While his poll numbers have declined over the last 40 days, there's still a year before Republicans have to face voters in the midterms. And, barring some kind of constitutional rewrite, Trump never has to worry about standing for election again.EPADemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was critical of the funding dealWith the end of the shutdown, Congress will get back to its regularly scheduled programming. Although the House of Representatives has effectively been on ice for more than a month, Republicans still hope they can pass some substantive legislation before next year's election cycle kicks in.While several government departments will be funded until September in the shutdown-ending agreement, Congress will have to approve spending for the rest of the government by the end of January to avoid another shutdown.Democrats, licking their wounds, may be hankering for another chance to fight.Meanwhile, the issue they fought over – healthcare subsidies – could become a pressing concern for tens of millions of Americans who will see their insurance costs double or triple at the end of the year. Republicans ignore addressing such voter pain at their own political peril.And that isn't the only peril facing Trump and the Republicans. A day that was supposed to be highlighted by the House government-funding vote was spent dwelling on the latest revelations surrounding the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Later on Wednesday, Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to her congressional seat and became the 218th and final signatory on a petition that will force the House of Representatives to hold a vote ordering the justice department to release all its files on the Epstein case.It was enough to prompt Trump to complain, on his Truth Social website, that his government-funding success was being eclipsed.\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" he wrote.It was all a very clear reminder that the best-laid plans and political strategies can be derailed in a flash.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "What we know about new Epstein emails that mention Trump5 hours agoNadine YousifGetty ImagesJeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump (pictured here in 1997) were friends for years, though the US president says he had a falling out with him in the early 2000sUS lawmakers have released more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some that mention President Donald Trump.Early on Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email exchanges, including correspondence between Epstein, who died in 2019 in prison, and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.They also released emails between Epstein and the author Michael Wolff, who has written numerous books about Trump.Within hours, House Republicans released a massive tranche of documents to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to \"cherry-pick\" documents. They also said it was an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" she said.Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.What the Epstein-Maxwell email saysThe first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell. In it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him\". Epstein goes on to write that Trump \"has never once been mentioned\", including by a \"police chief\".Maxwell responded: \"I have been thinking about that...\"The victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name \"Virginia\". The White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year. In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\". Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse. And in a memoir released this year, she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.Asked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.What the Epstein-Wolff emails sayIn exchanges with Wolff, the author, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who - at the time - was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office. In a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, \"either on air or in scrum afterwards\".Epstein responds: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"Wolff writes: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"He adds: \"Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"Reuters\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" Wolff said on WednesdayIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump. \"There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?\", Wolff writes to Epstein.A third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office.  In it, Epstein tells Wolff: \"Trump said he asked me to resign\" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was \"never a member ever\". Epstein adds that \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop\". Responding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.Andrew emailed Epstein in 2011As well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.He responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein.Andrew's reply reads: \"Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"Maxwell had forwarded a \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and then-Prince Andrew.The right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.On 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre.Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.White House says Epstein story \"a manufactured hoax\"Peter Mandelson contacted Epstein in 2016Lord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents.They show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016, according to the documents.The latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.An email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: \"63 years old. You made it\".Lord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".Epstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.Epstein goes on to say \"you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]\", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.What the survivors have saidAnnie Farmer, one of Epstein's accusers and a key witness in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial, shared a statement after the emails were released. In it she said: \"The more information that comes out about Jeffrey Epstein, the more questions we're left with. Survivors deserve more than a trickle of information.\"Farmer demanded the \"full release\" of the so-called Epstein files and said \"the estimated one thousand women and girls who were harmed by Epstein and his associates deserve full transparency\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisParis attacks: What happened 10 years ago?Just as France marks the 10th anniversary of the Bataclan massacres, another reminder has come of the permanence of the jihadist threat.A former girlfriend of the only jihadist to survive the November 2015 attacks has been arrested on suspicion of plotting her own violent act.The woman - a 27 year-old French convert to Islam named as Maëva B - began a letter-writing relationship with Salah Abdeslam, 36, who is serving a life sentence in jail near the Belgian border following his conviction in 2022.When prison guards discovered that Abdeslam had been using a USB key containing jihadist propaganda, they traced its origin to face-to-face meetings that the prisoner had with Maëva B.Detectives then looked into Maëva B's own computer and telephone, where they found evidence she may have been planning a jihadist attack, and on Monday she was placed under judicial investigation along with two alleged associates.With France commemorating 10 years since the worst attack in its modern history,  the arrest has focused minds on the enemy that never went away.Six plots have been thwarted this year, says Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, and the threat level remains high.ReutersThe word Bataclan has become a byword in France for extreme Islamist violence since the Paris attacks in 2015On the evening of 13 November 2015, jihadist gunmen and suicide bombers conducted a sequence of co-ordinated attacks that culminated in a bloody raid on the Bataclan concert hall in eastern Paris.Before that, three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France where a football international was under way. Then others in the gang opened fire with Kalashnikovs on people drinking in bars and cafés not far from the Bataclan.There,  a performance by American group The Eagles of Death Metal had just started, when three jihadists burst in and fired indiscriminately into the auditorium.  They took hostages and then blew themselves up as police moved in.Overall 130 people were killed, 90 in the Bataclan, and more than 400 treated in hospital. Countless others suffered psychological trauma.The word Bataclan has since become a byword in France for extreme Islamist attacks, in much the same way that 9/11 did in the US.  Though there have been other attacks since, like the Nice lorry massacre of July 2016 and the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty in October 2020, the scale and organisation of 13 November 2015 set it apart.Ten years on, much has changed. The disappearance of the Islamic State (IS) group as a major force in Syria and Iraq means that the wherewithal to conceive, plan and carry out complex terrorist projects is greatly diminished.ReutersAt the end of a day of events on Thursday, the Eiffel Tower will be lit up in the colours of the French flagThe Bataclan attackers were young men of mainly North African origin, recruited in Belgium and France, trained in IS territory in the Middle East, who then returned to Europe hidden among a vast flow of migrants. Everywhere they could draw on a network of supporters offering shelter, transport and cash.According to leading Middle East expert Gilles Kepel, intelligence services have also become highly effective in controlling online radicalisation.\"They now have access to IT resources… which allow them to detect a lot of individual initiatives, often not very sophisticated ones... and stop them before they hatch,\" he said in an interview with Le Figaro.But according to Mr Kepel, the danger now comes from what he calls \"ambient jihadism\".\"The threat is now home-grown and a lot younger. It feeds on friendships and social networks of the like-minded, without there ever necessarily being people having to give and obey orders,\" he said.The threat is all the more concerning, he believes, because it is so porous - with events in Gaza and Israel having a \"traumatic effect\" on the minds of many citizens and being \"exploited by the entrepreneurs of anger\".France's current political crisis is also stoking the danger, he argues, with an impotent presidency giving way to a partisan parliament where extremists of left and right hold increasing sway.\"If what separates us becomes more important than what unites us as French people and fractures the national consensus, then there will open a chasm beneath our feet and violence will have fewer and fewer restraints,\" he said.MAGALI COHEN/Hans Lucas/AFPIn recent days survivors have given accounts of how their lives have changed in the past 10 yearsThursday's commemorations will be held throughout the day at the various attack sites, culminating with the opening of a 13 November garden near Paris City Hall.  When night falls, the Eiffel Tower will be bathed in the red, white and blue of the French flag.French media have been full of accounts and memories, with survivors describing how their lives have changed.In an unexpected development, Salah Abdeslam has let it be known through his lawyer that he would be prepared to co-operate in any effort at \"restorative justice\" - a procedure where victims and perpetrators meet to discuss the impact of a crime.The idea has been mooted by some families - but others are vehemently opposed.According to Laurent Sourisseau, a cartoonist also known as Riss, who was shot and wounded in the Charlie Hebdo attack a few months before the Bataclan massacres, Abdeslam's offer is \"perverse\".\"Restorative justice exists for other types of crime - common crimes,\" he said.\"But terrorism is not a common crime. Salah Abdeslam wants to make us think his crime was like any other. But it was not.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoSean Dilley,North America Correspondent, Ed Campbell,BBC News Investigations and Chris GrahamIndigo / Getty ImagesAndrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges (file photo)Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor told Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell \"I can't take any more of this\", when he was first alerted 14 years ago that a British newspaper was about to run a report about the trio.His email conversation with the US-based pair was among documents from the estate of the convicted sex offender Epstein that were released on Wednesday, including some mentioning Donald Trump. The former prince's response came after he was forwarded a right-of-reply email that the Mail on Sunday had sent Maxwell in March 2011, which made numerous claims about Andrew.According to files released on Wednesday, Andrew's reply reads: \"What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"The latest release comes after Andrew was requested by Democrats in US Congress to answer questions as part of its investigation into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee, Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, told BBC Two's Newsnight that Andrew had not yet responded to the Committee's invitation to testify before the committee. He said the former prince \"doesn't have to get on a plane to testify, he can do it remotely\". Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein - alleged Andrew had sex with her three times as a teenager. Andrew, who has denied the allegations, reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology.He was stripped of all his titles earlier this month after Giuffre's posthumous memoir threw new focus on Andrew's ties to Epstein and Maxwell.Trump mentioned in emailsWhite House: Epstein story 'a manufactured hoax'Three emails from the Epstein estate, released by Democrats on the Congressional House Oversight Committee, indicate that Trump was mentioned several times by Epstein in emails exchanged with Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. They also released emails between Epstein and the author Michael Wolff, who has written numerous books about Trump.One email from Epstein to Maxwell, sent in April 2011, claims that Trump spent hours at Epstein's house with a person whose name was redacted.Epstein wrote: \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.\"The White House later said the unnamed \"victim\" referenced was Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year. In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\".Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse. And in a memoir released this year, she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.Within hours, House Republicans then released thousands more documents to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to \"cherry-pick\" documents. They also said it had been an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".Hours after the latest publication of emails, the newly-sworn in Democratic Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva signed a petition, meaning it now has sufficient numbers to force a House vote that could require the US Department of Justice to release all the Epstein files.The office of House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said the House would hold that vote next week.Epstein on Andrew photoPA MediaAndrew, with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell.The latest files shed further light on the relationship between Andrew and Epstein, with one email appearing to confirm a photograph of Andrew with his arm around a 17-year-old Giuffre was real. In an exchange with a journalist in July 2011, Epstein appeared to discuss Giuffre and her photograph with Andrew. \"Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have,\" he wrote. Andrew said in his 2019 Newsnight interview that he had no recollection of that photo being taken and has suggested it might be fake.That exchange came four months after the purported \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March 2011. The email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.On 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including the now infamous photograph of Andrew and Giuffre.The email goes on to say that the masseuse and another girl were directed to sit on Andrew's knee in Epstein's New York flat, and that he groped both girls. The email says that one of the girls was directed by Maxwell to have sex with Andrew. It also states she was directed to participate in an orgy with Andrew at Little St James - Epstein's private Caribbean island. It requests a reply by noon the next day.It appears that the email is sent to Maxwell by her representative, forwarded on to Epstein and then to a redacted email address marked \"The Duke\".On 6 March 2011, the day the Mail on Sunday published its Giuffre story, Epstein emails \"The Duke\", asking: \"You ok?\". He add: \"These stories are complete and utter fantasy\".In an email to his publicist in July that year, Epstein writes: \"The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar.\"I think Buckingham Palace would love it. You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has caused the Queen's son all this agro (sic).\"I promise you she is a fraud. You and I will be able to go to ascot (sic) for the rest of our lives.\"Mandelson in contact in 2016PA MediaLord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with EpsteinLord Mandelson also appears in the newly released documents, which show he had contact with Epstein as late as 2016.The latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.The new documents include an email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, saying \"63 years old. You made it\".Lord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".Epstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.Lord Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, after emails showed the peer sent him supportive messages after he pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor in 2008.Lord Mandelson, who has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein,  declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.",

    "body": "10 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesSkims, the shapewear brand co-founded by celebrity and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian, says it is now valued at $5bn (£2.93bn) after raising $225m of new funding.The company says it plans to use the money from investors, including an arm of Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs, to open more shops and expand around the world.\"We can't wait to take Skims to the next level as we continue to innovate and set the standard for our industry,\" Kardashian said on Wednesday.The funding round is one of the biggest this year for a US consumer brand and comes as Skims faces fierce competition from rivals like Lululemon.Skims, which runs 18 shops in the US and sells its products through retailers worldwide, will focus \"predominantly\" on its physical retail business over the next few years, it said in a statement.The company expects its sales to top $1bn this year, which Skims chief executive Jens Grede said gave the firm the confidence to pursue its long-term goals.The brand debuted in 2019 with a line of shapewear and has since broadened its range to include loungewear and other fashion categories.Getty ImagesSkims will focus \"predominantly\" on its physical retail businessThe company's growth has moved it deeper into the mainstream sports and athleisure market, which is largely dominated by brands like Lululemon and Alo Yoga.Skims has also amassed a large pool of influencers, including the Kardashians and other celebrities like Megan Fox and Paris Hilton to boost its appeal.Since its launch the company has faced some controversies. Its initial name, Kimono Intimates, was criticised for disregarding the significance of the traditional Japanese outfit, prompting the company to come up with another name - Skims.One Skims product - a head wrap worn during sleep - split the internet. Some hailed it as the future of non-invasive face contouring, but others condemned it as dystopian, and said the firm was making women feel more insecure.",

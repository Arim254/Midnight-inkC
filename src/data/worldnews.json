    "body": "2 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemBBCItzik Gvili demands the return of his son Ran, the last dead hostage in Gaza, in Tel Aviv's Hostages SquareIn central Tel Aviv, the main stage has now been dismantled in Hostages Square, the focal point for the campaign over the past two years to bring back Israelis held in Gaza.Nearby, signs and posters have been taken down, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum has vacated the offices that served as its nerve centre. Of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in the 7 October 2023 attacks, 168 have been brought back alive from Gaza, eight have been rescued. Only one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, remains.With songs and prayers instead of mass rallies, the Gvili family and a small crowd of supporters assemble in Hostages Square each Friday to mark the start of the Jewish Sabbath; this week, a candle for the Hanukkah holiday was also lit. They are determined to bring back the young police officer who was killed by Hamas fighters after he rushed to help people being attacked in Kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel in October 2023.\"I feel every day is still the 7 October. We didn't pass the 7 October, but we are strong, and we're waiting for him. We do whatever we need,\" says Itzik Gvili, Ran's father. \"This gives us hope: the support of the people.\"ReutersThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum's slogan is: \"Bring them home now\"From the start, people power has been key to the hostage families. As its operations wind down, members of the Hostages Families Forum have been reflecting on its extraordinary evolution which turned the grassroots group into a powerful international lobbying force.In the terrible aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led assault on southern Israel, which also killed some 1,200 people, a huge group of distraught relatives gathered for the first time in Tel Aviv desperately seeking answers about their missing loved ones. Because of the incoming rocket fire from Gaza, they met in an underground car park.\"We were together, shocked, and it fell on me that this is actually real, that now we are going to face this unbelievable challenge of understanding where all these people are, getting them home,\" recalls Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat had been snatched from Kibbutz Be'eri.\"And the second thing is that we're going to do this together. I'm not going to stand alone.\"ReutersGil Dickmann (2nd R) said the public support gave him hope after kidnapping of his cousin, Carmel GatThe formation of the new forum, with its slogan: \"Bring them home now\", gave the hostages' families a much-needed sense of regaining control.\"It was very, very powerful to feel that when the government and Israeli state, in a way collapsed in those very first few days after 7 October, it felt like nothing was working, what was working was Israeli society,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"So many wonderful people came to help. That brought me a lot of hope.\"Dividing its efforts between supporting the families - many of whom were bereaved and displaced from their homes following the attacks - and campaigning in Israel and around the world, the Hostages Families Forum worked with more than 10,000 volunteers. They included former Israeli diplomats, lawyers and security officials.Funded entirely by donations, it began to pay some staff, and a high-tech company loaned its central Tel Aviv office space.ReutersA makeshift tunnel symbolizing Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza was constructed at Hostages Square In November 2023 - more than six weeks into the brutal war in Gaza, which had by then killed more than 14,000 Palestinians according to the Hamas-run health ministry - Israel and Hamas agreed to a Qatar-mediated truce.This saw most women and children hostages returned in exchange for Israel releasing more than 240 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. Hamas also freed some foreign nationals.But after a week, the fighting resumed with ferocity. About half of the hostages were left in Gaza. In December, three Israeli hostages were killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza despite the fact they were shirtless, waving a makeshift white flag, and calling out in Hebrew.Israeli Prime Minister's Office/handout via ReutersItay Regev and his sister Maya were released during the November 2023 ceasefireThose were difficult days for the Hostages Families Forum and in early 2024, with polls suggesting more Israelis prioritised eliminating Hamas over the return of those still held captive, it brought in political strategist, Lior Chorev, as campaign manager.\"We were in deep war in Gaza, deep war in Lebanon, there was the Iranian threat, and it appeared that everything was stuck, and public opinion was against us,\" Mr Chorev explains.\"As a civil society organisation, we could not impact whether or not there's going to be a deal, but we could work hard on the Israeli public opinion to ensure that if a deal came into place, it would have a sound civilian majority within the country.\"ReutersGaza has been devastated by the two-year war sparked by 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on IsraelAs well as Saturday evening demonstrations in the plaza in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, now renamed Hostages Square, there were near-daily actions by the Hostages Families Forum ranging from concerts and art installations to civil disruption. Media and diplomatic teams helped keep the hostages at the centre of attention.\"They kept going 24/7 for two years,\" comments Times of Israel political correspondent Tal Schneider who, like visiting foreign officials, often went to the forum's HQ. \"This place became like a foreign ministry for the country, for the families of 250 people.\"Looking back, Michael Levy says his intensive campaigning helped him deal with the \"emotional rollercoaster\" after his sister-in-law, Einav, was killed at the Nova Festival and his younger brother, Or, was taken hostage alive.\"The only thing that helped me was becoming active. I was interviewed all the time. I went with 15 different delegations to over 12 countries. I spoke to whoever was willing to listen and didn't want to stop and think,\" Mr Levy says.\"You need to stay optimistic all the time. You need to tell yourself every morning that today is going to be the day that he's going to be released, even though you know you are lying to yourself.\"ReutersMichael Levy's brother, Or, was released during the ceasefire that lasted from January to March 2025Although a hostage-prisoner exchange deal to end the war laid out in mid-2024 was described by then-US President Joe Biden as an Israeli proposal, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was widely seen as dragging out hostilities to aid his own political survival – a claim he rejected.Tensions rose between the Hostages Families Forum and Israel's government; there was open animosity from some government supporters.The situation worsened after a Netanyahu aide was accused of deliberately acquiring and illegally leaking a top-secret document to a German newspaper to influence how Israel's public viewed negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal. The document was misleadingly cast as suggesting that pressure on the prime minister played into the hands of Hamas.ReutersHundreds of people were killed or taken hostage at the Nova music festival during the 7 October 2023 attacksFor Mr Dickmann and Mr Levy, there was a low point when they headed to Washington for Netanyahu's address to a joint meeting of US Congress in July 2024 with other forum members.They showed off T-shirts saying \"Seal the deal\" during an ovation for the Israeli leader and were arrested for an unlawful demonstration. \"That was one of the moments in which I felt most alone,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"It was one of the most frightening things and it was while Carmel was still alive in captivity.\"The worst news came a month later when Carmel and five other hostages were killed by their Hamas captors, as the Israeli military closed in nearby.Mr Dickmann says it was only an \"unbelievable support group\" of younger forum members that helped him get through the ordeal.After the Israeli deaths were confirmed, angry protesters flooded the streets of Israeli cities. The forum puts the total number at 600,000.In Tel Aviv, a crowd of hostage families and their supporters marched with six prop coffins. A crowd gathered outside Israel's military headquarters and clashed with police on a major road.EPAThe killing of Carmel Gat and five other hostages by their Hamas captors sparked a huge protest in Tel AvivBy the start of 2025, international opposition to the devastating Gaza war had reached new heights as the number of Palestinians killed approached 48,000, according to Gaza's health ministry.In Israel, polls indicated a clear shift in Israeli public opinion, with a growing majority backing a hostage deal to end the war. With the election of a new US president, the Hostages Families Forum was increasingly directing its efforts stateside.\"They needed to bypass their own government,\" comments Ms Schneider.  \"The most important person for the job was obviously [US] President [Donald] Trump. There were signs written in English carried by the people and they would pack all their messages into a one-minute video, and they'd send it to him.\"Working with regional mediators, the US secured a new Gaza deal between Israel and Hamas in January 2025, just as Trump took office. The first stage brought back 33 hostages – eight of whom were dead – in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Five Thai hostages were also released.But in mid-March, Israel ended the ceasefire, resuming its heavy bombing of Gaza, without starting talks on the deal's second stage, which involved a full end to fighting and the return of the remaining hostages.The White HouseReleased hostages travelled to Washington to ask President Donald Trump to ensure the return of those left behind in GazaFrail and emaciated following his release in February under the ceasefire deal, Or Levy was emotionally reunited with his three-year-old son, his parents and brother Michael. However, Michael's joy was short-lived. He quickly resumed his campaigning with others in the Hostages Families Forum.\"I got what I wanted, I got my brother back, but I couldn't just stop,\" he says, \"I couldn't be happy because in those 491 days, they became my family. I almost felt I knew all the other hostages, that every hostage still there was part of my family.\"Newly freed hostages gave TV interviews saying they had been starved and beaten in captivity, sometimes in response to the ill-treatment of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Despite their trauma and fragile health, a few of the former hostages travelled to the White House urging President Trump to use his influence to bring back all the living and dead Israelis they had left behind in Gaza.ReutersEvyatar David was among the last 20 living hostages freed shortly after the current ceasefire began in OctoberThere were more dramatic moments.In September, an Israeli air strike unsuccessfully targeted the exiled Hamas leadership as it met in Qatar, a regional mediator, to discuss a new ceasefire proposal presented by the US.However, the ultimate effect was to push the Trump administration - backed up by its Arab allies – towards a new plan to end the war, which had by then killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.Israel and Hamas agreed a ceasefire deal, under which all 20 living and 28 dead hostages still in Gaza would be handed over in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as a surge in humanitarian aid and a partial Israeli withdrawal.ReutersIsrael released about 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza in exchange for the living hostagesWhen Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived in Israel just after the latest ceasefire started on 10 October, they were greeted by rapturous applause on stage in Hostages Square.On 13 October, the remaining living hostages came back.\"I'll never have a happier day in my life,\" says Mr Dickmann, remembering seeing his best friends reunited with their loved ones.Mr Chorev, the Hostage Families Forum's chief strategist, considers that long-held Jewish and Israeli traditions won through.\"This basic value of the Israeli theme that you don't leave anyone behind, that you're responsible for each and every Israeli held by the enemy, this was something that was unclear to certain elements in the Israeli government,\" he says. \"But it was very clear to the Israeli public.\"Tali (L) has been helping out hostages' families since the beginning of the warSlowly, 27 of the dead hostages' bodies have been returned to Israel over the past two months.Amid the ruins of Gaza, where health ministry officials say the number of Palestinians killed has risen to more than 70,000, Hamas operatives and the Red Cross have been searching for Ran Gvili's body east of Gaza City.Now, the last funds of the Hostages Families Forum are being used to support the Gvilis and a few dozen volunteers continue to head to Hostages Square on Fridays.\"We have been here in the rain and in nearly 50-degree [Celsius] heat, from winter to summer,\" says Tali, from Tel Aviv. \"Now that this is nearly over, I have mixed emotions. There is still one hostage who hasn't come back. I told myself I would stay until the last one.\"A symbolic tunnel, a large \"Hope\" sign and a piano put in the square in honour of now released hostage, Alon Ohel - a musician - have not yet been removed, nor has the giant countdown board which marks the days since 7 October 2023. A final mass rally is promised for when Ran Gvili's body is returned for burial.Itzik and Talik Gvili are determined to bring their son Ran home for a proper burial Israel's prime minister has never appeared in Hostages Square, but he has met with released hostages and hostage families, including those from a small, alternative group to the Hostages Families Forum, the Tikva Forum. The Gvilis belong to both.The family joined a candle-lighting ceremony on the first night of Hanukkah with Netanyahu.\"We will bring Ran back, just as we brought back 254 out of our 255 abductees,\" the prime minister said. \"Some did not believe. I believe. My friends in the government believed. They said: 'It will be a miracle.' I said: 'This nation performs miracles.'\"But in Israel, painful questions linger over why more hostages' lives were not saved.The Hostages Families Forum recently released harrowing Hamas videos recovered in Gaza which show the six hostages who were later murdered, including Carmel Gat, celebrating Hanukkah in a tunnel in 2023.The hostage crisis continues to cast a long shadow over Israeli society; even as many take heart from the families' message of endurance and solidarity.Additional reporting by Davide Ghiglione and Gidi Kleiman",

    "body": "9 hours agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his trial. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied. The most serious one - colluding with foreign forces - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\"Never,\" Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".Monday's verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Then in 1989, Beijing crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

    "body": "Watch: Moment German engineer becomes world's first wheelchair user to go into spaceAn engineer from Germany has become the world's first wheelchair user to go into space. Michaela Benthaus, who suffered a spinal cord injury in a mountain bike accident seven years ago, had reached out to a retired space engineer online to see if her dream of being an astronaut was still possible. He then helped organise the historic 10-minute flight with Blue Origin, the space tourism company founded by Jeff Bezos. Ms Benthaus and five others blasted off from Texas on Saturday and reached a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space, known as the Kármán line.\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing in a video shared by Blue Origin.\"I didn't only like the view and the micro-gravity, but I also liked going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"New Shepard, Blue Origin's reusable sub-orbital launch vehicle, took off from the company's Texas launch pad at 14:15 GMT.Ms Benthaus, who works at the European Space Agency, said she had \"really, really figured out how inaccessible our world still is\" for people with disabilities following her accident.She made her own way from her wheelchair into the capsule, using a bench extending from the hatch. Hans Koenigsmann, the retired SpaceX manager who helped organise the trip, was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Ms Benthaus said. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?\" Koenigsmann said Ms Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. \"It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time,\" he said.Blue Origin said ground support equipment was added to help Ms Benthaus enter and exit the capsule. \"Michi's flight is particularly meaningful, demonstrating that space is for everyone, and we are proud to help her achieve this dream,\" Phil Joyce, senior vice-president of New Shepard, said. The cost of the mission, which is the 16th suborbital space tourism launch carried out by Blue Origin, has not been revealed. The company has taken dozens of tourists to space. In April, pop star Katy Perry, Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King were among six women blasted into space aboard a Blue Origin rocket for a flight that lasted about 11 minutes.The high-profile flights come at a time when private space companies are fiercely competing for dominance in space tourism.

Police say the attackers were inspired by \"Islamic State ideology\". A national day of reflection is being held on Sunday. A minute's silence will be observed at 18:47 (07:47 GMT) - the time when the attack began.Albanese said the intelligence review, due by April 2026, would focus on ensuring authorities were equipped to tackle extremism.He said: \"The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet will examine whether federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the right powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe in the wake of the horrific antisemitic Bondi Beach terrorist attack.\"In the wake of Australia's deadliest mass shooting in almost three decades, the government has also announced plans to tighten gun controls, while the New South Wales premier is pushing to crack down on hate speech.Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.Surfers and swimmers pay tribute to victims of Bondi shooting on FridayEarlier on Sunday, Governor-General Samantha Mostyn addressed a vigil held in Bondi, hosted by the National Council of Jewish Women Australia, where attendees largely wore white to symbolise peace.\"The entire Jewish community, whether it's here in Bondi or across our nation, you are part of the belonging story and the success of this country,\" she said.Australians across the country are still reeling and there's a sense of shock and disbelief that something like this could have happened. But this weekend, normality returned in some ways. Bondi promenade was once again filled with surfers, runners and dog-walkers returning to their regular routine.While a sombre mood lingers, children's surf club activities - known locally as \"nippers\" - resumed on Sunday as a sign of the community showing resilience. The bridge where two gunmen opened fire on a crowd of people at a Jewish festival at Bondi beach on Sunday, 14 December.Bullet holes in a car's windshield parked at Bondi a harrowing reminder of the violent attack North Bondi's Surf Life Saving president Steve Larnach told the BBC they had considered cancelling the regular nippers events.\"We were also aware of the sensitivity towards our Jewish community,\" Larnach said. \"We did ask their opinion, they were very supportive of us going ahead but also extremely grateful for what we did.\"Lifeguard volunteers were among the first on the scene at the shooting last week providing first aid, Larnach added. Some surf lifesavers have been hailed as heroes, including one who was photographed sprinting from a neighbouring beach with a red first aid kit slung over his shoulder.Geraldine Nordfelft, who brought her daughter to nippers, said \"it was really important to return to whatever this new normal is as soon as we could\".\"You have to return, you can't stay away, you can't let fear win. The beach is the Australian way of life and we all love it,\" she told the BBC. Geraldine Nordfelft brought her daughter to 'nippers' on SundayMore on this story",

    "body": "The US has seized an oil tanker that had recently departed from Venezuela, according to the US Department of Homeland Security.It is the second time this month that the US has seized an oil-carrying ship off the country's coast. The move comes after US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was ordering a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.Venezuela has condemned the latest US seizure, describing it as \"theft and kidnapping\". Venezuela has previously accused the US of trying to steal its resources. \"These acts will not go unpunished,\" a statement from the Venezuelan government said, adding that it intends to file a complaint with the UN Security Council and \"other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world\".The operation was led by the US Coast Guard, similar to the operation earlier this month. The ship was boarded by a specialised tactical team, and was in international waters when it was taken.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees the Coast Guard, shared a video of the operation on X. \"In a pre-dawn action early this morning on Dec 20, the US Coast Guard with the support of the Department of War apprehended an oil tanker that was last docked in Venezuela,\" Noem wrote.She posted a seven-minute video of the operation, which shows US helicopters landing on the deck of a ship with the name Centuries written on the side. \"The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,\" Noem wrote, adding: \"We will find you, and we will stop you.\"The Centuries is a Panamanian-flagged ship, but in the past five years it has also sailed under the flags of Greece and Liberia, according to records seen by BBC Verify.It is not on the US Treasury's list of sanctioned vessels.In recent weeks, the US has been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.The US has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.The US has accused Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro of leading a designated-terrorist organisation called Cartel de los Soles, which he denies.The Trump administration accuses him and the group of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\".Following the seizure of the second ship, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X that the US will continue to \"unflinchingly conduct maritime interdiction operations... to dismantle illicit criminal networks.\" \"Violence, drugs, and chaos will not control the Western Hemisphere.\"Venezuela - which is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves - is highly dependent on revenues from its oil exports to finance its government spending.Trump's announcement of a \"blockade\" came less than a week after the US seized an oil tanker believed to be part of the \"ghost fleet\" off the coast of Venezuela, which allegedly used various strategies to conceal its work.The White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port.Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.",

    "body": "Just nowCarrie Davies,BBC Pakistan correspondentandAnna LamcheFormer Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been sentenced to further jail terms following a fraud case involving state gifts.They were convicted of breaking Pakistan's rules on gifts after Bibi was given a luxury jewellery set by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman during a 2021 state visit.The pair are already serving time in prison for earlier convictions, and the new sentences - 10 years for criminal breach of trust and seven years for criminal misconduct, and a fine - will reportedly run concurrently to their earlier terms.Khan has described the charges as politically motivated and his lawyer told BBC News his team plan to challenge the verdict.Speaking to the BBC after the hearing, the former prime minister's lawyer, Salman Safdar, said Khan's legal team had only been informed about the sentencing late on Friday night, after normal court hours.They planned to mount a challenge to the verdict in the high court, Mr Safdar said.This case is the latest in a series of charges laid against the cricket star-turned-politician, who has been detained since August 2023. In January, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison over a separate corruption case.He has faced charges in more than 100 cases, ranging from leaking state secrets to selling state gifts. The BBC has been unable to confirm the exact number brought against him.The jewellery case, referred to as Toshakhana 2 in Pakistan, concerns a Bulgari jewellery set given to Bushra Bibi by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a state visit in 2021, according to court documents. Under Pakistan's rules on state gifts, these items go to Pakistan's Toshakana department (state treasury), but politicians are able to purchase the items back.Khan is alleged to have asked a private firm to undervalue the jewellery set, before purchasing it back at a significantly reduced price.In addition to their jail terms, the pair were handed a fine of over 16 million Pakistani rupees (£42,600).Khan was also convicted in an earlier, different Toshakhana case - but he challenged that conviction, meaning his sentence is suspended until the outcome of his appeal. He also has other cases outstanding against him.These include terrorism charges relating to violent protests that took place on 9 May 2023, when he was previously arrested.Khan was Pakistan's prime minister until April 2022 when he was ousted in a vote of no confidence.Although he has not been seen in public, his social media accounts have continued to operate with messages attributed to him on X often appearing after jail visits.These have been highly critical of Pakistan's current government and its politically powerful army Chief Field Marshall Asim Munir, including posts calling him a tyrannical dictator.In November, he was denied any visitors for nearly a month.After campaigning by his family and party, his sister was allowed to visit in early December; a few hours after she saw him, his account posted a comment credited to Khan calling the Field Marshall Asim Munir a \"mentally unstable person\". Khan, 73, has not been allowed any family visits since.The judgement states the judge was lenient in sentencing because of Khan's \"old age\". Update: This story was updated to clarify the latest legal status of Khan's earlier, separate Toshakhana case.",

    "body": "1 day agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia Editor, MoscowReporters ask world leaders questions all the time.No big deal. Right?But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of \"the export of chaos\"?And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.\"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. \"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.Putin returns to my question.\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.",

Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.It said the operation \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.President Donald Trump said \"we are striking very strongly\" against IS strongholds, following the 13 December IS ambush in the city of Palmyra in which two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed.In a statement on X, Centcom – which directs American military operations in the Middle East, north-east Africa, central and southern Asia – said Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched at 16:00 Eastern Time (21:00 GMT) on Friday.Centcom commander Admiral Brad Cooper said that the US \"will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists who seek to harm Americans and our partners across the region\".Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), told news agency AFP that \"at least five members of the Islamic State group were killed\" in eastern Syria's Deir ez Zor province, including the leader of a cell responsible for drones in the area.Petra, Jordan's state-run news agency, announced the Royal Jordanian Air Force had participated in the strikes to \"prevent extremist groups\" from \"threaten[ing] the security of Syria's neighbours and the wider region\".IS has not publicly commented. The BBC was unable to immediately verify the targets.US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the operation \"is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance. \"If you target Americans - anywhere in the world - you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,\" the US defence secretary added.US Air Force/ReutersThe US Army identified the two soldiers killed in the attack as Sgt Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, and Sgt William Nathaniel Howard, 29Posting on Truth Social, President Trump said the US \"is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible\".He said the Syrian government was \"fully in support\".Centcom earlier said that the deadly attack in Palmyra was carried out by an IS gunman, who was \"engaged and killed\".Another three US soldiers were injured in the ambush, with a Pentagon official saying that it happened \"in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"At the same time, the SOHR said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security forces.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.US Air Force/ReutersA US Air Force photo handout shows a KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft taking offIn 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks.The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.Syria has recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.In November, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former jihadist leader whose coalition forces toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024 - met Trump at the White House, describing his visit as part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.",

    "body": "1 day agoRitu AgarwalLucknowMaroof CulmenBiryani in Lucknow is cooked on a low, slow heat, with the pot's lid tightly sealed with doughMouth-watering kebabs, fragrant biryani and whipped cloud-like desserts.The northern Indian city of Lucknow has always been a food lovers' paradise, with locals and visitors swearing by its cuisine.Last month, Unesco recognised it as a Creative City of Gastronomy - adding it to a select list of global cities and kindling hopes that it will spotlight Lucknow's sublime food. With this designation, it joins a global network of 408 cities across more than 100 countries committed to promoting \"creativity as a driver of sustainable urban development\".The recognition \"is a testament to its deep-rooted culinary traditions and vibrant food ecosystem\", Tim Curtis, director and representative, Unesco Regional Office for South Asia, said.\"It honours the city's rich cultural legacy while opening new avenues for international collaboration,\" he added.Lucknow is only the second Indian city - after Hyderabad which was selected in 2019 - to find a place in this coveted list of 70 cities globally.The accolade for my home city doesn't surprise residents or food lovers - many echo celebrity chef Ranveer Brar's take: \"Better late than never. It should have come before.\"With the Unesco recognition, my beloved, chaotic, eclectic city - the capital of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh - is finally in the spotlight for what has always defined its soul: a passion for food.Madhavi Kuckreja, founder of Sanatkada Trust which is spearheading a project on the Kitchens of Lucknow, told the BBC that what gives the city's food its distinct flavour is the slow pace and the time taken to cook a dish.\"'What will be cooked, how will it be cooked?' is a continued conversation from waking up until going to bed in most homes. And you are actually judged by the quality of food that comes out of your kitchen,\" she says.But this focus on food is not new and many of the dishes that have come to define the city's cuisine have been around for hundreds of years.Maroof CulmenLucknow is famous for its melt-in-the-mouth kebabsThe City of Nawabs - as it's popularly called after its 18th and 19th Century wealthy Muslim rulers - is known for its melt-in-the-mouth kebabs and a distinctive take on biryani that were created, evolved and taken to sublime levels in their kitchens.These royal kitchens were centres of culinary innovations, blending the Persian and local Indian styles to create what became the cuisine of Awadh - as the region was then called.It was during this time that Lucknow's most famous kebabs were fashioned. The story goes that the mutton galouti kebabs that have defined the city amongst visitors were created to feed an ageing nawab who had lost his teeth. His cooks minced the meat with papaya, saffron and spices and made it so fine and silky that it needed no chewing.But perhaps the biggest contribution of the cooks of Awadh was the slow-cook Dum pukht technique where food is cooked on a low, slow heat, with the pot's lid tightly sealed with dough.It was popularised during the 18th Century reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah - the region was in the grip of a famine and he initiated a work-for-food programme. Large cauldrons with rice, vegetables, meat and spices were sealed to make a one-dish meal.The story goes that the Nawab caught a whiff of the aromas emanating from the pots, demanded a taste and the Dum technique was officially adopted in his kitchens.This technique was revived and commercially popularised in modern India by the late chef Imtiaz Qureshi, recognised as an Awadhi cuisine maestro and the force behind present-day iconic Delhi restaurants Bukhara and Dum Pukht, which are included in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list. Besides the obvious kebabs and biryani, the cooks also built up a repertoire of dishes that included kormas (curries), sheermal (saffron flat bread) and shahi tukda (bread pudding).But Lucknow is not just about kebabs and biryani - the region is also a vegetarian's paradise.Maroof CulmenThe city offers unique seasonal delights, such as Makkhan Malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winterThe local Baniya community's traditionally strictly vegetarian cuisine not only celebrates seasonal produce but also gives the city its highly curated Indian desserts and sweets and unique street food, like chaat - spicy, tangy fried snacks.Almost at every corner, there are little shops and kiosks, the little-known hidden gems that are popular with the locals.In the city centre of Hazratganj, huge crowds start milling around from 5am at Sharmaji Tea Stall to get a steaming cup of milky masala chai, served in clay glasses, along with pillowy soft buns lathered with hand-churned white butter.Morning walkers, political strategists and journalists gather around this nondescript shabby shack, which has been operating since 1949 and is now a legacy tourist attraction.For breakfast, one can head to Netram - a no-frills joint operating in the old city area of Aminabad. Nearly 150 years after it was set up in 1880, the place is still much sought-after for its hot kachoris (fried bread stuffed with lentils) and jalebis (crispy sweet made of deep-fried fermented batter and soaked in sugar syrup).Its sixth-generation owners - father Anmol Agarwal and sons Anoop and Pranshu - continue to safeguard the process and craftsmanship behind every recipe. An automobile engineer by education, Pranshu is passionate about his legacy. \"This runs in my blood. There is nothing else I would rather do,\" he says.Getty ImagesThe Sharmaji Tea Stall is famous for its milky masala chaiThe city also offers unique seasonal delights, such as makkhan malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winter. The process of making it is scientific and complicated. The cook hand-churns the milk and then leaves it out at night, exposed to the dew that gives it its incredible frothy texture.On cold mornings, street vendors can be seen lined up in old city areas like Aminabad and Chowk. Many, however, say that their children do not want to learn the art.Chef Brar, who is also from Lucknow and has been an unequivocal advocate for its food, has often said that the city's rich food legacy places it right on top of the pile of the Indian street food experience. But the real value from the Unesco recognition, he says, will occur only if Lucknow can now create awareness about its lesser-known eateries.Ms Kukreja says every dish in Lucknow tells a story - shaped by generational food businesses, from humble street carts to bustling restaurants, and guarded family recipes.The international acclaim, she hopes, will encourage more people around the world to learn these stories and visit the city to savour the culinary delights of Lucknow.",

    "body": "1 day agoPaul KirbyandLaura GozziWatch: Putin tells BBC Western leaders deceived RussiaRussian President Vladimir Putin has said there will be no more wars after Ukraine, if Russia is treated with respect - and dismissed claims that Moscow is planning to attack European countries as \"nonsense\".In a televised event lasting almost four and a half hours, he was asked by the BBC's Steve Rosenberg whether there would be new \"special military operations\" - Putin's term for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours,\" he asserted.Earlier this month, Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to.Answering a question from the BBC Russia editor on Friday, Putin also added the condition that there would be no further Russian invasions \"if you don't cheat us like you cheated us with Nato's eastward expansion\".He has long accused Nato of going back on an alleged 1990 Western promise to then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev before the fall of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev later denied the remark had been made.The \"Direct Line\" marathon combined questions from the public at large and journalists from across Russia in a Moscow hall, with Putin sitting beneath an enormous map of Russia that encompassed occupied areas of Ukraine, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.Russian state TV claimed more than three million questions had been submitted.Just hours after the televised marathon, Ukrainian officials said seven people were killed and a further 15 injured in a Russian missile strike on Ukraine's southern Odesa region. Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.EPAOrganisers of the event said three million questions had been submitted to PutinAlthough the \"Direct Line\" was largely choreographed, some critical comments from the public appeared on a big screen, including one that referred to the event as a \"circus\", another bemoaning internet outages and one that highlighted poor-quality tap water. Mobile internet outages have been blamed by authorities on Ukrainian drone attacks.Putin also addressed Russia's faltering economy, with prices rising, growth on the slide and VAT going up from 20 to 22% on 1 January. One message to the president read: \"Stop the crazy rise in prices on everything!\"The Kremlin regularly uses the end-of-year event to highlight the resilience of the economy and, as Putin spoke, Russia's central bank announced it was lowering interest rates to 16%.Foreign policy issues were mixed with musings about the motherland, praise for local businesses, fish prices and the importance of looking after veterans.But the issue of almost four years of full-scale war in Ukraine was never far away and it was often in the background of many of the questions.Putin again claimed to be \"ready and willing\" to end the war in Ukraine \"peacefully\" but offered little sign of compromise.He repeated his insistence on principles he had outlined in a June 2024 speech, when he demanded that Ukrainian forces leave four regions Russia partially occupies and that Kyiv gives up its efforts to join Nato.Chief among Russia's demands is full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas, including about 23% of Donetsk region which Russia has not been able to occupy.Putin argued Russian forces were making advances across the front line in Ukraine and he ridiculed Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the front line at Kupiansk last week, when the Ukrainian leader was able to refute Russia claims that it had captured the town.Putin has also demanded new elections in Ukraine to be included in the peace proposals that US President Donald Trump has submitted as part of his efforts to bring the conflict to an end. At his news conference, Putin offered to stop bombing Ukraine when voting took place.Ukraine's SBU security service said on Friday it had for the first time hit an oil tanker operating as part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean.  Putin said it would not lead to the result that Kyiv wanted and would not disrupt Russian exports.Most of the questions from Russian media or from the public made little attempt to challenge Putin, but two were allowed from Western correspondents, Keir Simmons of US network NBC and the BBC's Steve Rosenberg.When Simmons asked if Putin would feel responsible for the deaths of Ukrainians and Russians if he rejected the Trump peace plan, Putin praised the US president's \"sincere\" efforts to end the war, but said it was the West not Russia that was blocking a deal.\"The ball is in the hands of our Western opponents,\" he said, \"primarily the leaders of the Kyiv regime, and in this case, first and foremost, their European sponsors.\"Trump has said a peace deal is closer than ever and, despite Putin's apparent refusal to compromise, the US president has said he hopes \"Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there\".A Ukrainian delegation is holding talks in Miami on Friday with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. German, French and British officials are also there, days after they met the US officials in Berlin.Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev is also expected in Miami over the weekend, according to reports.Putin told the BBC's Russia Editor: \"We are ready to work with you - with the UK and with Europe in general and with the United States, but as equals, with mutual respect to each other.\"We are ready to cease these hostilities immediately, provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to cooperate with you.\"He accused the West of creating an enemy out of Russia. Skating over his decision to mount a full-scale invasion in February 2022, he said: \"You are waging a war against us with the hands of Ukrainian neo-Nazis,\" before repeating his regular diatribe against Ukraine's democratically elected leaders.European intelligence agencies have warned that Russia is only a few years away from attacking Nato. The Western defensive alliance's chief Mark Rutte said this month that Russia was already escalating a covert campaign and the West had to be prepared for war.While many of the questions were benign, including several from children, from a one reporter from Yakutia in north-eastern Siberia highlighted a tenfold increase in energy prices in the past four years. Putin told her that his team would look into alternative sources of energy and \"keep Yakutia in mind\".Towards the end of the TV marathon, Putin was asked a series of quickfire questions, touching on his views on friendship, religion, the motherland and love at first sight. He said he believed in love at first sight - then added that he himself was in love, without divulging any more details.",

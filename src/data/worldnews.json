When will you admit that it's a crime?

I hope one day we can find each other again.\"</p><p>She also asked to stop being referred to as an icon. \"I am an ordinary woman who dared to open up her trial,\" she said. \"I have become an icon against my will.\"</p><p>As in the original trial, Gisèle ended her statement with a thought for other victims of rape – the majority of whom did not have the wealth of evidence that she had to bring her abusers to court.</p><p>\"I want to say to them to never be ashamed of what was inflicted upon us, because it is not their fault,\" she said.</p></div></article>",

He added that they \"knew Phillips had firearms and was motivated to use them\".</p><p>Police said they could not provide further details amid ongoing investigations. </p><p>Mr Phillips' family had previously made public appeals to him to return.</p><p>In a message addressed directly to him during a television interview, his sister Rozzi said \"we're ready to help you walk through what you need to walk through\".</p><p>His mother Julia also wrote him a letter - provided to New Zealand outlet Stuff - saying that every day she hoped \"today will be the day that you all come home\".</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>Burkina Faso's military government says it has arrested eight members of a Dutch-based humanitarian organisation, accusing them of \"spying and treason\".</p><p>They are three Europeans, a Malian, and four Burkinabé - among them the NGO's country director and deputy. The organisation said they were detained some time ago but it was not previously reported.</p><p>Security Minister Mahamadou Sana said the NGO had \"collected and passed on sensitive security information that could be detrimental to national security and the interests of Burkina Faso, to foreign powers\".</p><p>The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO), which provides safety information to aid workers, has \"categorically\" denied the allegations.</p></div><div><p>Anthony Neal,  a representative of the NGO told the BBC's Newsday programme that its Burkina Faso country director had been detained since July when the organisation was suspended. The seven others were arrested later.</p><p>\"We continue to work towards their safe and immediate release,\" he said.</p><p>The NGO was suspended on 31 July for three months by the authorities for \"collecting sensitive data without authorisation\". It has been working in the country since 2019.</p><p>On Tuesday, the security minister said that despite being banned, members of the organisation had continued to secretly collect information and hold meetings.</p><p>Mr Neal denied the claim, saying its information-collection activities had ceased on 31 July but its staff remained in Burkina Faso to deal with the detention and meet its contractual commitments.</p><p>A statement by the  organisation emphasised that the information it collects was not confidential and was meant for the safety of humanitarian workers.</p><p>It added that the Burkinabé authorities were \"fully aware\" of their work and mandate and had been co-operating with the authorities.</p><p>Mr Neal said he had tried to engage with the government to address any misunderstandings or concerns. He said safety information was critical, with a \"record\" number of aid workers having been killed this year around the world.</p><p>Burkina Faso's military government led by Capt Ibrahim Traore seized power in a coup three years ago, and has had a frosty relationship with Western nations ever since.</p><p>In response to a worsening Islamist insurgency, the junta stopped working with the former colonial power, France, and instead turned to Russia for military assistance.</p><p>Human rights groups have since accused the army of committing abuses against civilians while tackling the militants, and also cracking down on political dissent and freedom of expression.</p></div>",

After Mr Comey's lawyer requested a speedy trial, the judge set a date of 5 January.</p></div><div><p>Both the prosecution and defence expected the trial to last just two or three days.</p><p>In court on Wednesday, Mr Comey's lawyer Patrick Fitzgerald told the judge that they planned to file several motions to dismiss the case before a trial, arguing the prosecution was vindictive and that a US attorney had been unlawfully appointed to take over the case.</p><p>Mr Comey was fired as FBI director in 2017, about four months into Trump's first term as president. At the time, Mr Comey had been leading an investigation into Russian election interference and whether there were any links between Moscow and Trump's campaign.</p><p>The federal government alleges Mr Comey lied to Congress during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September 2020, when he was being questioned about both the Russia election probe and an investigation into Trump's 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.</p><p>He told the hearing that he had not authorised someone at the FBI to leak information about the investigations - a statement the Justice Department alleges was untrue and therefore misleading.</p><p>Prosecutors also accuse Mr Comey of \"corruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct and impede\" the panel by making false statements to it.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj07ndrnr34o\">What is Comey accused of?</a></li></ul><p>Mr Comey's case was originally overseen by Erik Siebert, a Virginia prosecutor who resigned under pressure from Trump after his investigation into another political adversary - New York Attorney General Letitia James - failed to bring criminal charges. </p><p>Trump then appointed Lindsey Halligan to replace him, who secured a grand jury indictment against Mr Comey less than a week into the job. Prosecutors before her had declined to take on the case due to a lack of evidence.</p><p>Mr Comey appeared in good spirits as he entered the courtroom on Wednesday, chatting with his attorneys and making jokes. He was joined by his wife, Patrice Failor, and daughter Maureen Comey, a federal prosecutor whom the Trump administration recently fired.</p><p>After listening to the judge read his rights and the two counts against him in court on Wednesday, Mr Comey was asked if he understood the charges.</p><p>\"I do, your honour. Thank you very much,\" he told the court.</p><p>US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff said the two charges each carry a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to a $200,000 (£149,442).</p><p>Ms Halligan's hasty ascent to the role of top federal prosecutor in Virginia's eastern district in September was reflected in Wednesday's proceedings, when defence lawyers complained they did not have access to classified documents that prosecutors intended to submit as evidence. </p><p>\"We feel the cart has been put before the horse,\" Mr Fitzgerald said.</p><p>Judge Nachmanoff warned the government: \"I will not slow this case down because the government does not promptly turn over information.\"</p><p>During his tenure as FBI director, Mr Comey sparked a backlash from Democrats when he announced the investigation into Clinton's emails just days before the 2016 presidential election. Charges against Clinton were never brought, leading to criticism from Republicans as well. </p><p>Since leaving government, Mr Comey has been an ardent critic of the Trump administration.</p><p>In a video Mr Comey posted to his Instagram after he was indicted, he said he was innocent and accused Trump of acting like a \"tyrant\".</p><p>\"My family and I have know for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump,\" he said. \"We will not live on our knees.\"</p><p>\"I'm innocent,\" he added. \"So let's have a trial.\"</p><p>The charges against Mr Comey came after Trump posted on social media demanding his attorney general, Pam Bondi, prosecute Mr Comey and others.</p></div>",

I want to hear the truth. It's the people who kept telling me that everything was fine who are responsible for our current situation,\" he said.</p><p>Rajoelina has been holding these meetings as part of his pledge to \"listen more\", emphasising that the challenges facing the Indian Ocean island nation can only be solved through honest conversations and not protests.</p><p>Gen Z Mada called for a nationwide strike on Thursday, following the expiry of their 48-hour ultimatum for the president to resign. The details remain unclear.</p><p>The protest group has vowed not to back down, urging people from all regions to join them and declaring that \"the Malagasy people do not submit\".</p><p>Last week, Rajoelina sacked his entire government and appointed an army general as prime minister on Monday. The protest movement rejected the appointment and vowed to continue their struggle.</p><p>Rajoelina came to power in 2009 after leading mass protests that triggered military intervention and overthrew then-President Marc Ravalomanana.</p><p>Although the youth-led movement continues to demand his resignation, street protests appear to have weakened.</p><p>Life in most parts of the capital, Antananarivo, continues as normal, except in a few neighbourhoods with a heavy police presence, where some roads have been blocked or are being closely monitored.</p><p>At least 22 people have died in clashes with security forces and scores more have been injured, according to the United Nations. The authorities have disputed these figures.</p></div>",

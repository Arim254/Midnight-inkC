    "description": "The Trump administration cannot suspend food aid used by more than 40 million low-income Americans amid the ongoing US government shutdown, two federa",
    "body": "The Trump administration cannot suspend food aid used by more than 40 million low-income Americans amid the ongoing US government shutdown, two federal judges have ruled. The decisions, issued within moments of each other on Friday by judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, said the government must pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap, benefits using a contingency fund.The Snap programme works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy essential grocery items.The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced this week it would not distribute food assistance funds in November due to the shutdown, saying \"the well has run dry\". A family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 (£4.50) per day, per person.The states administer the benefits, using money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October. Several states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.Half of US states sued the Trump administration over its plans to halt funding, hoping to force it to use a roughly $6bn (£4.5bn) emergency contingency fund for  Snap, also known as food stamps.The Massachusetts judge said the administration must access the contingency funding to pay the benefits and had until Monday to report back to the court on whether they will authorise at least partial benefits for November.Massachusetts US District Judge Indira Talwani wrote in her decision that the  states who sued are likely to win in court on their claim that \"Congress intended the funding of SNAP benefits, at a reduced rate if necessary, when appropriated funds prove insufficient\".Judge Talwani also wrote that the Trump administration \"erred in concluding\" that the USDA is blocked by law from tapping the emergency reserves in the contingency fund when there is a lapse in federal funding.The USDA had said those reserves were insufficient to pay full benefits, which cost $8.5bn to $9bn each month. Its secretary had said she would only use the fund for an emergency such as a natural disaster.Even if the government turns to the contingency fund, it would only be able to cover about 60% of beneficiaries in a single month, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families.Judge Talwani has asked the administration to report on Monday whether it will use the fund to pay reduced benefits or if it will pay full benefits for the month by moving money from other programs, similar to the administration transferring military research funds earlier this month to pay members of the armed forces.Separately in Rhode Island, a lawsuit was brought by a number of US cities and NGOs who sued over what they called the \"unlawful suspension\" of the programme.\"There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food, for their family,\" Judge US  District Judge John  McConnell said.On Friday, the group behind that lawsuit said in a statement that the ruling \"is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table\".\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon.\"Republicans and Democrats have traded blame for the federal shutdown, which will soon enter its second month, and there has not been any meaningful progress toward a deal.",

    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

    "body": "4 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterSubscribers to YouTube TV have lost access to ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels, as the two companies struggle to negotiate a licensing deal.Disney said the online pay-TV platform, which is owned by the tech giant Google and available only in the US, had refused to pay fair rates for the content, which also include National Geographic and the Disney channel. In its own statement, YouTube TV said that Disney's proposed terms \"disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products\".After tense negotiations, the channels vanished from YouTube TV just before midnight on Thursday - the deadline to reach a new deal. The blackout affects roughly 10 million subscribers.If Disney channels remain suspended for an \"extend period of time\", YouTube TV said it would offer subscribers a $20 credit.YouTube and Disney-owned Hulu are among the biggest online TV platforms in the US.Their stand-off follows similarly contentious talks this year between YouTube and other media companies, which had also threatened to limit the shows available to YouTube TV subscribers. Google struck a deal at the last minute with Comcast-owned NBCUniversal earlier this month to keep shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" on YouTube TV. It has also reached agreements with Paramount and Fox in recent months.In separate statements, both Google and Disney said they were working toward a resolution to restore Disney content to YouTube TV.Still, the companies remain divided on fees.\"With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement.But YouTube said in a statement that Disney was proposing \"costly economic terms\" that would lead to higher prices for YouTube TV customers and limit their options for content, benefiting Disney's own live TV offerings like Hulu+ Live TV.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorLatvian MPs have voted to withdraw from an international accord aimed at protecting women from violence, including domestic abuse, after a long and intense debate in parliament.Several thousand people protested against the vote this week in Riga. It is now up to President Edgars Rinkevics to decide whether to approve the law or not.Known as the Istanbul Convention, the 2011 treaty only came into force in Latvia last year, requiring governments to develop laws and support services to end all violence.Latvia is the first EU country to move towards pulling out of the treaty. Turkey withdrew in 2021, a move described as a huge setback by top human rights body  the Council of Europe.It is a setback for centre-right Prime Minister Evika Silina, who joined protesters outside parliament earlier this week. \"We will not give up, we will fight so that violence does not win,\" she told them.The treaty was ratified by the EU in 2023, however ultra-conservative groups have argued that the accord's focus on gender equality undermines family values and promotes \"gender ideology\".After a 13-hour debate in the Saeima, Latvian MPs voted by 56 to 32 to withdraw from the treaty, in a move sponsored by opposition parties but backed by politicians from one of the three coalition parties, the Union of Greens and Farmers.One of the main political groups behind the withdrawal is Latvia First, whose leader Ainars Slesers has called on Latvians to choose between a \"natural family\" and a \"gender ideology with multiple sexes\".Latvia's ombudswoman Karina Palkova called for the treaty not to be politicised, and the group Equality Now said it was \"not a threat to Latvian values, it was a tool to realise them\".Thursday's vote has prompted an outcry both within Latvia and beyond. Twenty-two thousand people have signed a Latvian petition not to drop the treaty. Women's rights group Centrs Marta has called a protest next Thursday, accusing MPs of not listening to the Latvian people.The head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, Theodoros Rousopoulos, said Latvia had made a hasty decision fuelled by disinformation. It was, he said, an \"unprecedented and deeply worrying step backwards for women's rights and human rights in Europe\".Since Turkey abandoned the treaty four years ago, femicide and violence against women had risen sharply, he added.As the vote did not win a two-thirds majority, it means the president could return the bill for another reading, if he has objections. President Rinkevics said on X that he would assess the decision under the constitution, \"taking into account state and legal, rather than ideological or political, considerations\".Last week another member of the ruling coalition, the Progressives, said it would not rule out appealing to the Constitutional Court.Women are more likely to be victims of partner violence than men, according to the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), an EU agency.In its latest figures, EIGE said 142 incidents of intimate partner violence against women were reported across Latvia in 2022. This was above the 109 offences recorded in 2021 but below the totals in the previous three years and during the Covid pandemic.",

    "body": "A Japanese superhero series that inspired the hugely popular Power Rangers TV and movie franchise from the 1990s is ending after 50 years, local media report.Super Sentai will go off air as sales from merchandise and events have not been enough to cover production costs, reports say. Its broadcaster TV Asahi declined to comment on \"future programming\", according to the Asahi newspaper.The series premiered in 1975 and its formula - five teens who transform into colourful masked fighters to battle aliens - served as the blueprint for Power Rangers in the US and many other superhero shows that aired in Asia.It also served as a launchpad for the careers of many Japanese actors.Super Sentai was much more than a TV series. The show that aired weekly was essentially an advertisement for toys, clothes, costumes and collectibles.For animation and toy fans outside Japan, it served as a gateway to the country's colourful superhero and comic book culture.Similar shows like Choudenshi Bioman and Hikari Sentai Maskman were dubbed in English and developed cult followings in the Philippines.In the Super Sentai series, the superhero team, made up of three men and two women, is led by a fighter in a red suit - as in Power Rangers. The rest of team is colour-coded, green or black for the second-in-command, followed by blue, yellow and pink.Every episode also followed the same sequence - starting with martial arts and swordfights and ending with a battle between their robot spaceship and a giant alien in the end. A large part of its appeal is the live-action animation, which in the 1980s and 1990s bordered on crude.The original Power Rangers series aired on US TV from 1993 to 1996 and there have been multiple spin-offs. The episodes are now streamed on YouTube.Producer Haim Saban, who adapted Power Rangers from the Japanese original, said in a 2017 interview with the LA Times that the concept was a tough sell at first.\"Every selling season, I would go out and offer it to the networks - and would get kicked out of the room... They told me how crazy I was,\" he said.News of Super Sentai's demise drew sadness from fans and celebrities.Popular actress Keiko Kitagawa re-posted a news article on the reported cancellation with the caption \"despair\". Her post on X was viewed 15 million times.Yasuhisa Furuhara, an actor who played one of the Super Sentai fighters, noted how the series ran for half a century. \"I'm proud to be a part of history,\" he said on X.One fan on X said his parents had watched Super Sentai when they were children. And that he is watching the current series. \"I'll miss it... What a shame.\"\"Super Sentai is coming to an end, so what should boys watch from now on?\" another fan said.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPierre Crom/Getty ImagesRob Jetten, 38, is now tipped to become the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch historyCentrist liberal leader Rob Jetten has claimed victory in Wednesday's nail-biting Dutch election, after vote analysis indicated his party could not be beaten by anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.Jetten's D66 party currently has a narrow lead of 15,000 votes over Wilders' Freedom Party, and Dutch news agency ANP says even though the vote count is not complete, Wilders can no longer win.\"We are the biggest party in the Netherlands! Now we'll get to work for all Dutch people,\" Jetten posted on X. Wilders said it was the electoral council not a news agency that decided the result: \"What arrogance not to wait for that.\"Projections from about 99% of the vote put both parties on 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament - but ANP says Jetten's centrists could win a 27th seat.Jetten, 38, told reporters he was \"very proud of this historic result\" and now felt a great responsibility to form a stable and ambitious government.Wilders had led opinion polls going into Wednesday's election, but Rob Jetten succeeded in winning in some of the main Dutch cities including Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht with a positive campaign using a catchphrase of \"Yes, we can\". No Dutch election race has ever been so close, and if Jetten does become prime minister he will be the youngest in Dutch history.Until now Jetten was careful not to declare victory until all votes were in, but ANP said based on figures from postal voters abroad he could now be declared the winner.Wilders said even if D66 did go on to become the biggest party, his Freedom Party (PVV) would \"not let the Netherlands be broken up by Jetten and his people\".Jetten told reporters that his party had \"shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message\".The Dutch electoral system is based on proportional representation in one nationwide constituency, so whichever party secures most votes wins most seats. Jetten's liberals have so far won 16.9% of the vote, while Wilders' Freedom Party is on 16.7%. As results came in on Thursday, the race was so close that the lead flipped between the two parties.In a sign that he was not ready to concede victory, Wilders dubbed the Dutch news agency \"ANP66\" and shared unfounded claims from social media of vote-rigging. One local authority, in Zaanstad outside Amsterdam, rejected the allegation as \"fabricated\".Although the D66 leader's path to forming a coalition is not straightforward, Jetten has said he wants to make a quick start.Jetten said after the vote that never before had a party won a Dutch election with fewer than 30 seats. He will need the support of at least three other parties to gather the 76 seats needed to form a coalition. The most obvious candidates would be the conservative-liberal VVD, the left-wing Labour (PvdA)-GreenLeft alliance and the Christian Democrats, but it could take months if that is to happen.VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz has so far ruled out working with the left, but Jetten said he favoured a broad-based government from the centre of Dutch politics.The weekend would be a good chance for all the parties to reflect, before a \"scout\" is given the task next Tuesday of sounding them out. Jetten said he wanted to construct a coalition that represented best the millions of voters who had backed other parties to tackle the main issues, including the housing shortage and asylum and migration.His path to victory has stunned observers. Less than two years ago he led D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - to fifth place and just nine seats. Only a few weeks ago they were still languishing in the opinion polls, but gradually improved as Jetten put in several polished performances in TV debates and even  competed in the final of a TV quiz show 11 days before the election.Outgoing Prime Minister Dick Schoof predicted on Friday that Jetten's task of forming a coalition would prove complicated. \"I reckon I'll still be prime minister at Christmas - I'd be surprised if it happened [by then]\".Schoof, a former chief of Dutch intelligence, was picked for the top job by Geert Wilders, who abandoned his bid to lead the country last year because his prospective coalition partners would not support having a far-right prime minister.Wilders won the last election in November 2023, and a government was only formed in July 2024. Eleven months later, he brought his own government down, in a row with his coalition partners over asylum and migration policy.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney accepted an invitation to visit China extended by President Xi Jinping, signalling a \"turning point\" in the countries' relationship.The invite came after the two leaders met for 40 minutes on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on Friday. It was the first meeting between a Canadian prime minister and the Chinese president since 2017. The countries have had a strained relationship since a diplomatic row in 2018 and been locked in a trade dispute since 2024.But as trade tensions between Canada and the US continue to rise, Carney has said the country will turn to strengthening its ties with other major economies.He has signalled his desire to double Canada's non-US exports in the next decade, in response to President Donald Trump placing punishing tariffs on Canadian goods and some of its critical sectors. That includes closer trade ties with  \"the economic giants of Asia\", Carney said last week. Speaking briefly to reporters after his meeting with Xi on Friday, Carney said he believes Canada and China have hit a \"turning point\" in relations that will yield positive developments for the Canadian economy. \"Distance is not the way to solve problems, not the way to serve our people,\" the prime minister said.In his own remarks, Xi said \"China is willing to work with Canada to push China-Canada relations back onto a healthy, stable, and sustainable correct track\" that benefits both countries. The two leaders directed their officials \"to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants,\" according to a readout released by Carney's office after the meeting. A trade dispute  has been escalating since Canada placed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) in October 2024, mirroring similar action by the US. Later that same month, Canada placed a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminium. China retaliated in March by imposing tariffs on several Canadian agricultural products, including a 76% levy on Canadian canola seed imports and a 100% levy on canola oil, meal and peas.These measures have hurt farmers in the western part of the Canada, as China is by far the largest importer of the country's canola seeds. Some western provincial premiers, including Wab Kinew of Manitoba and Scott Moe of Saskatchewan, have since called on the federal government to drop tariffs on Chinese EVs. Kinew said earlier this month that Canada has now found itself in a \"two-front trade war\" with its two largest trading partners — the US and China.Separately, the US has imposed a 35% tariff on all Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, as well as a 50% levy on steel and aluminium and a 25% levy on automobiles. Ontario premier demands apology from US ambassador over tariff 'tirade'What tariffs has Trump announced and why?Last week, US-Canada relations hit a new low after Trump suspended all trade talks over an anti-tariff advertisement run by Ontario Premier Doug Ford that featured an address on free trade by former US president Ronald Reagan. On Friday, Trump said the two countries will not restart trade talks. Trump has also threatened to raise tariffs on Canada another 10%, though it is unclear if and when that would come into effect. Prior to the tariffs, Canada-China relations were already reeling from a diplomatic row that resulted in Beijing detaining two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovring. The two were accused by China of espionage and were taken into custody in 2018. Their arrest came days after Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese technology executive and chief financial officer of Huawei, at the request of the US. All three were subsequently released in 2021 after the US Department of Justice dropped an extradition request for Ms Wanzhou on charges of fraud.China was also one of the countries called out for possibly meddling in Canada's 2019 and 2021 elections, prompting a Canadian public inquiry into foreign interference. That inquiry concluded that attempts by foreign states to meddle in recent elections were \"troubling\" but had \"minimal impact\".China has denied any allegations of meddling. Carney's APEC meeting with Xi in South Korea comes one day after the Chinese president met with Donald Trump - the first between the two in six years.In that Thursday meeting, Xi and Trump agreed to dial back their countries' trade war. No formal agreement has been signed, but the two signalled they are closer to a deal that would lower tariffs.",

    "body": "12 hours agoCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiIndia and the US have signed a framework agreement to expand defence cooperation over the next 10-years. The pact was announced after a meeting between US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement will enhance \"coordination, information sharing and tech cooperation\" and advance \"regional stability and deterrence\", Hegseth said on X. It comes as the two countries are trying to close a trade deal and tide over tense ties after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariffs on India, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms. The agreement is expected to provide policy direction to the entire spectrum of the India-US defence relationship. \"It is a signal of our growing strategic convergence and will herald a new decade of partnership. Defence will remain as a major pillar of our bilateral relations. Our partnership is critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region,\" Singh said, in a post on X. According to Pramit Pal Chaudhuri of the Eurasia Group think tank, the agreement was supposed to have been concluded in July-August this year, but India's irritation at Trump's statements about his role in ending the conflict with Pakistan led to it getting delayed. The pact is the latest in a series of agreements between the two countries that have made it \"easier for the two militaries to achieve interoperability, India to access technology and the two defence sectors to work together\", Mr Chaudhuri said. \"This provides for further potential in all three areas,\" he added. India and the US have been steadily ramping up their defence ties recently. Defence was a major talking point between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump on the former's visit to the US in February this year, withTrump saying the US would increase military equipment sales to India by many billions of dollars,  ultimately paving the way to providing Delhi with F-35 stealth warplanes.But since then, Delhi's dependence on discounted Russian oil as well as its long-standing defence relationship with Moscow have been a major point of irritation for the Trump administration. While Russia continues to be a major supplier of arms to India, its share of Indian defence imports has been steadily falling as Delhi seeks to diversify its portfolio and boost domestic capacity.In recent months India has hinted that it would be open to increasing energy and defence purchases from the US. The two countries are locked in high-stakes trade talks, aimed at reaching a long-awaited deal by November. With inputs from Soutik Biswas, India correspondent with the BBC.",

    "body": "18 hours agoTabby WilsonWatch: Moment Spain's Sagrada Familia crowned world's tallest churchThe Sagrada Família has become the tallest church in the world, after workers placed the first part of a cross at the top of its central tower. Now measuring 162.91 metres tall, the Spanish basilica has officially pipped the record from the Ulm Minster in Germany, which has held the crown since 1890.Designed by acclaimed architect Antoni Gaudí, the place of worship has been under construction in the centre of Barcelona for more than a century, with the main building due to be completed next year. The central Tower of Jesus Christ will grow with the addition of the rest of the cross over the next few months, eventually standing at 172 metres tall. The first stone of the Sagrada Família was placed in 1882, with up-and-coming architect Gaudí taking over the project the following year. He transformed the original designs for the basilica into a far more ambitious proposal, which was initially funded by donations from repentant worshippers. At the time of his unexpected death in 1926, just one of the planned 18 towers had been built.In the years following, the construction of the architectural marvel was managed by the Sagrada Família foundation, and funded by contributions from tourists, visitors and private donors.Getty ImagesIn addition to the death of its primary architect, the basilica has hit a number of roadblocks throughout its almost 150-year construction. During the Spanish Civil War, Catalan anarchists set fire to the crypt, destroying plans and plaster models created by Gaudí that would guide future construction.Most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic saw construction on the building halted, with members of the foundation attributing the pause to a lack of tourism, and the subsequent drop in funding for the project.Behind the scenes of stunning La Sagrada FamiliaGaudí’s La Sagrada Família: Genius or folly?In September this year, Sagrada Família General Director Xavier Martínez told the Associated Press that the Tower of Jesus Christ would be completed in 2026, to coincide with the centenary of Gaudí's death.The foundation will hold a series of events to commemorate the architect, who is buried in the church's crypt.Work on decorative details, sculptures and a stairway leading to the building's main entrance is expected to continue over the next decade.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMayeni Jones,Africa correspondent, Bernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Natasha BootyThe South African government has criticised the US's decision to prioritise refugee applications from white Afrikaners, saying claims of a white genocide have been widely discredited and lack reliable evidence.It highlighted an open letter published by prominent members of the Afrikaner community earlier this week rejecting the narrative, with some signatories calling the relocation scheme racist.The limited number of white South African Afrikaners signing up to relocate to the US was indication that they were not being persecuted, it added.On Thursday, the administration of US President Donald Trump announced its lowest refugee annual cap on record - to just 7,500.The exact figures of the number of white South Africans who have been admitted through the US scheme are not available. South Africa's latest crime statistics do not indicate that more white people have fallen victim to violent crime than other racial groups. Earlier this year President Trump offered refugee status to Afrikaners - who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers - after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances. Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Unpacking the South African land law that so inflames TrumpOn the road incorrectly identified as a 'burial site' by TrumpMost private farmland is owned by white South Africans who make up just over 7% of the population.Several months ago, South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".President Trump held up a photo purporting to show body bags containing the remains of white people in South Africa, but the Reuters news agency later identified the photo as one of their own - taken thousands of miles away in the war-struck Democratic Republic of Congo.Washington did not comment on the claim that they had misidentified the image.The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.",

There have been reports of mass executions and crimes against humanity as the RSF fighters stormed the city after an 18-month siege marked by starvation and heavy bombardment.The flow of those fleeing the violence towards the town of Tawila, about 80km (50 miles) west of el-Fasher, had increased in the past few days, the UNHCR's Eujin Byun told the BBC.They were narrating horrendous stories of atrocities, including rape, and the agency was struggling to find enough shelter and food for them, she said.But the RSF has detained one of its militiamen, Abu Lulu, who has been accused of summary executions.The group shared footage showing the fighter's arrest after BBC Verify identified him as being responsible for the execution of multiple unarmed men near el-Fasher.TikTok has confirmed to the BBC that it has banned the account associated with Lulu. It is not clear whether he had controlled the account in his name.Sudan was plunged into a civil war in April 2023 after a vicious struggle for power broke out between its army and the RSF.It has led to a famine and claims of a genocide in the western Darfur region.More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes in what the UN has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis.The takeover of el-Fasher reinforces the geographic split in the country, with the RSF now in control of western Sudan and much of neighbouring Kordofan to the south, and the army holding the capital, Khartoum, central and eastern regions along the Red Sea.The two warring rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup in 2021 - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.Additional reporting by Merlyn Thomas",

    "body": "US space agency Nasa has rejected reality star Kim Kardashian's claim that the 1969 space mission to land the first man on the Moon was faked.\"Yes, we've been to the Moon before... 6 times!\" Nasa acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote on social media.Kardashian made the comments on the latest episode of her long-running TV series The Kardashians, telling co-star Sarah Paulson she thought the Moon landing \"didn't happen\".Despite being consistently debunked, conspiracy theories as to whether humans actually reached the Moon have persisted for more than 50 years, particularly with the rise of social media. In the episode, Kardashian can be seen showing Paulson an interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who along with Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission.\"I'm sending you a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and the other one,\" Kardashian says, before reading a quote allegedly from Aldrin responding to a question about the scariest moment of the expedition.\"There was no scary moment because it didn't happen. It could've been scary, but it wasn't because it didn't happen,\" she reads.It is unclear which article Kardashian was reading from, or if the quotes were actually from Aldrin.Moments later, the reality star is seen telling a producer \"I centre conspiracies all the time\", adding that she believes the Moon landing was fake.\"I think it was fake. I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen. He says it all the time now, in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin,\" she says.Following the broadcast, Duffy tagged Kardashian in a post on X, rebuffing her comments, and promoted Nasa's current moon exploration program Artemis, which is \"going back under the leadership\" of Donald Trump.\"We won the last space race and we will win this one too,\" he added.In response, Kardashian wrote back asking about the interstellar object named 3I/Atlas, which astronomers said could be the oldest comet ever seen.\"Wait…. what's the tea on 3I Atlas?!?!!!!!!!?????\" she replied.Duffy later invited Kardashian to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the Artemis mission to the moon.For  decades, scientists and experts have rebutted conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo 11 mission was a hoax.\"Every single argument claiming that Nasa faked the Moon landings has been discredited,\" according to the Institute of Physics.",

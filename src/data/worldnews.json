    "body": "2 days agoChiamaka DikeBBC Africa, Makoko, LagosGift Ufuoma/BBCA mother of five, Anna Sobie's wooden home is one of many that has been demolished in a shanty town in a lagoon in Lagos, with critics describing it as a \"land-grab\" by the authorities to gentrify the prime waterfront spot in Nigeria's biggest city.Lagos State government officials deny the allegation, saying they are demolishing parts of Makoko - the country's biggest informal waterfront settlement - because it is expanding near high voltage power lines, posing a major health and safety risk.Sobie and her children now sleep on the narrow broken platform where their house stood until a few weeks ago on Lagos Lagoon. This is the biggest of 10 lagoons in a mega-city that is facing an acute housing crisis - and where life is becoming increasingly expensive, pushing more people to the margins of society. As Sobie spoke to the BBC, canoes - steered with paddles or long bamboo poles - moved through the narrow waterways, carrying mattresses and sacks of clothes belonging to the displaced people.Residents say the demolitions began two days before Christmas, when excavation teams accompanied by armed police moved into sections of the waterfront settlement facing the Atlantic Ocean.In a joint statement last month, 10 non-governmental organisations said that \"armed thugs, security personnel and demolition teams with bulldozers descended repeatedly on the community\" to tear down homes, and burn them.\"Homes were set on fire with little or no notice, in some cases while residents were still [inside],\" the NGOs added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCAnna Sobie's family are living on the the ruins of their houseWhen the BBC visited Makoko, smoke, from the rubble of torched homes or from fires that people had lit, burning damp wood to dry their clothes, was hanging in the air.Excavators were at work along the shoreline - houses built on wooden stilts over the lagoon were still being pulled down, their planks collapsing into the water below.  Corrugated metal sheets were falling from roofs and drifting between boats. Makoko was founded in the 19th Century by fishing communities who have lived in the settlement ever since, along with other low-income families and migrants who come to Lagos in search of better opportunities. Ownership of the lagoon is fiercely contested. The state government claims ownership of it under federal law, saying Makoko has been built without planning permission or occupancy rights. Older residents dispute this, saying the settlement predates modern Lagos, and they have what they call a customary right to it.Estimates of Makoko's population vary, from 80,000 to 200,000, but much of the settlement now lies in fragments.The NGOs said that more than 10,000 people have been displaced after the destruction of more than 3,000 homes, as well as schools, clinics and churches. The state government has not given any figures of the buildings demolished.Sobie's home was among those that have been destroyed. \"I was inside when it started,\" she says. \"The noise was very loud. When we came out, we saw the excavator.\"She says there was little time to move her family's belongings. Her son Solomon's school in Makoko was demolished the same day. Sobie's family moved briefly into a building nearby. That, too, was later pulled down. \"We're sleeping in an open space under the rain, and they're currently setting properties ablaze,\" Sobie says, adding:  \"We don't have another place.\" Like many other children, Solomon no longer goes to school. He now helps his mother gather firewood from collapsed houses, pulling loose planks from the debris to sell.Even as the excavators work, canoe-borne business activities continue, with traders peddling their way through the remaining homes to sell fish and goods. But many other traders can no longer do business, as they lost their goods when their homes were demolished or torched.With the lagoon central to their lives, they have protested against the move to force them out of Makoko. Gift Ufuoma/BBCThe state government says it will give financial compensation to families whose homes have been destroyedMore than 1,000 angry residents marched last week to the state legislature, the House of Assembly, demanding an audience with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, whose offices are nearby.But police responded by firing tear gas, with protesters saying that at least one person was injured in the ensuing chaos.Community leaders and residents say that tear gas was also fired during the demolitions a few weeks ago, causing the death of five people, including children. \"Children were weeping, some died, some were unconscious, and were taken to the hospital as a result of the tear gas,\" Sobie tells the BBC.The Lagos State government says it is unaware of their personnel using tear gas or of deaths linked to the demolitions. Speaking to the BBC, the state's commissioner for information, Gbenga Omotoso, says that any such claims would be investigated.\"We would determine the actual cause of death,\" he says. \"Our personnel will not knowingly kill anybody.\"The state government has defended the demolitions, saying they are targeting homes built beneath high voltage power lines.\"No responsible government anywhere in the world can allow people to live directly under high-tension cables or obstruct vital waterways,\" the governor's special adviser on urban development, Olajide Abiodun Babatunde, said in a statement. Governor Sanwo-Olu said that affected families would be provided with financial grants and other assistance, and it was wrong to accuse him of \"destroying\" Makoko. He raised concern that shanties were \"sprawling\" at an \"incredible speed\", getting closer to the Third Mainland Bridge, the longest and busiest of three bridges connecting the mainland to the islands - the commercial heart of the city and its wealthier neighbourhoods.For the governor this spells danger.\"So, what we have done is that we just pushed them back,\" he added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCSome residents suspect their homes have been demolished to pave the way for an upmarket development Lagos-based real estate developer Peacemaker Afolabi tells the BBC that demand for land in the city is huge.\"Everywhere in Lagos is prime land,\" he says. \"And waterfront is always prime.\" Some residents suspect that the demolitions are aimed at clearing the area for private developments, including luxury homes.This has been repeatedly denied by the state government, but suspicion remains.\"This is not the slow, decades-long gentrification often seen in Western cities. It's a rapid, almost violent reshaping that is already forcing millions of residents to the margins,\" he writes. \"In the next few years, Lagos may look more polished and globally appealing. But for many of its people, it will also become profoundly unliveable.\"In their joint statement, the NGOs said that demolitions in Makoko, and other settlements last year, were part of a \"sinister agenda to grab land\". \"These actions against thousands of peaceful, hardworking residents represent a deliberate pattern of state-enabled violence against the urban poor, carried out to clear valuable land for elite interests and private mega-developments,\" the NGOs said. \"The housing deficit has thus grown from approximately 2.95 million units in 2016 to 3.4 million in 2025, a 15 per cent increase,\" Nigeria's Punch newspaper quoted the report as saying.Rapid population growth, rising rents and limited access to formal housing have pushed many low-income residents into informal settlements, particularly along waterfronts and transport corridors.The authorities have demolished homes in Makoko in the past - most recently in 2017, when residents obtained a court order to prevent forced evictions without adequate notice, compensation and resettlement.Megan Chapman, co-director of the Justice and Empowerment Initiatives campaign group, says the government has failed to provide residents affected by the latest demolitions with alternative accommodation. \"They have to identify everyone who will be affected and make arrangements before homes are lost,\" she tells the BBC\"When people are removed like this, it affects livelihoods, family structures and how communities function over time.\"When the BBC was in Makoko, boys were sitting along the lagoon, repairing their broken fishing nets. Children moved between piles of debris, collecting firewood from collapsed structures. A tractor pulled away from what was once a house. Only a small number of buildings remained standing, including the homes of traditional leaders.Elizabeth Kakisiwe says she sleeps nearby.Each evening, she lays wooden boards on damp ground for her children and packs them away again in the morning.\"We were at the market when it started,\" she says. \"When I came back, my house was gone.\"She says there was no clear warning and no time to remove belongings. Clothes, cooking utensils and mattresses were lost. When rain fell days later, they were drenched.\"At night, we sit in the cold,\" she says. \"If the children feel sick, we give them paracetamol.\"Cooking has become difficult, she says, because rain has made the ground wet and rats move through the debris. \"Yesterday, we only drank garri,\" Kakisiwe says, referring to a popular cassava-based meal that is often made as a drink. \"There is nothing to cook.\"Expressing a similar view, Sobie says: \"The suffering is much. A lot of people have been dying. We just don't know what to say. It's only God that can help us.\"Additional reporting by Gift UfuomaMore BBC stories about housing in Lagos:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "4 hours agoDoug FaulknerMiguel MEDINA / AFP via Getty ImagesA 14-year-old who stabbed his art teacher told French police he attacked her because he had \"too much hatred\", a prosecutor has said.The 60-year-old woman's condition remains a \"serious concern\" after she was stabbed three to four times in her chest in front of 22 students in south-eastern France on Tuesday, a local official said.Toulon prosecutor Raphaël Balland said in a statement that the boy had premeditated the attack, having described to police taking the knife from his kitchen at home with the \"intention of stabbing his teacher\".La Guicharde school, in Sanary-sur-Mer, was evacuated after the attack on Tuesday, and lessons the next day were cancelled.Balland said there was no known religious or political motivation for the stabbing and that the student was allegedly upset that the teacher had reported several disciplinary incidents against him, which the boy said were \"unfair\". The teenager told authorities he \"deeply regretted\" the attack, AFP news agency reported, and felt more hatred towards himself than the victim.A decision on whether to place him in pre-trial detention will be made when he appears in court.The victim, who has been at the school for 28 years, according to AFP, is in Sainte-Anne Military Hospital in Toulon. She is reported to have been stabilised after surgery but remains in a serious condition.It is the latest in a series of attacks by students in French schools in recent years.Last year, a 14-year-old was charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June.In a separate case in April, a student killed a girl and wounded several others in a knife attack in the western city of Nantes.In 2020, teacher Samuel Paty was murdered by a Chechen refugee outside the school where he taught in a suburb of Paris, an attack which was motivated by religious extremism.Education minister Édouard Geffray, who visited the Toulon school on Tuesday, has described the attack as \"unacceptable\" and said that since March last year, 525 bladed weapons had been seized at schools \"before they could cause injury\".\"Schools reflect our society, and they cannot, on their own, stem the rise in verbal and physical violence that characterizes our times,\" he wrote on X.\"The real challenge lies here: fundamental work to de-escalate tensions. This involves families, teaching staff, elected officials, and every citizen. This is a fight we must wage together.\"",

    "body": "17 hours agoKoh EweX/Liu HuLiu Hu, a prominent investigative reporter in China, was previously arrested in 2013 on suspicion of defamationRights groups and activists are sounding the alarm about the detention of two Chinese investigative journalists after they reportedly exposed corruption by a senior official in Sichuan province.Independent journalists Liu Hu and Wu Yingjiao were taken by police on Sunday after they published their investigation, rights groups say.Critics have long flagged concern about media repression in China, where authorities have arrested and prosecuted journalists, accusing them of causing trouble.Chengdu police said on Monday that two men, identified by their surnames Liu and Wu and aged 50 and 34, were under investigation for \"making false accusations\" and \"illegal business operations\".In response a question about the arrests, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters on Wednesday that relevant authorities had already released information on the case.\"China is a country ruled by law, and Chinese judicial organs handle cases according to law; everyone is equal in face of the law,\" the spokesperson said.Liu, a prominent investigative reporter in China, was previously arrested in 2013 on suspicion of defamation after accusing a high-ranking official of corruption.After his release in 2014, he continued his investigations and published his reports on social media.Wu is frequently listed as Liu's collaborator on a public WeChat account where Liu and other journalists post news articles.According to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, which is a coalition of Chinese and international activists and groups, Liu had planned to take a train from his home city of Chongqing to the capital Beijing on Sunday when he went missing.Wu was taken by police in Hebei province on the same day, the group said.According to rights groups, the pair's recent report had exposed a county official's alleged corruption.The title of the report - which cannot be found on WeChat any more - had referred to businesses driven to bankruptcy due to the official's actions.Before Liu's arrest this week, he had posted to WeChat several messages he had received from a Chengdu disciplinary inspection official urging him to contact authorities rather than publish reports in the media, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said.\"This arrest highlights just how restrictive and hostile China has become toward independent reporting,\" RSF advocacy manager Aleksandra Bielakowska said in a statement.\"We call on the international community to intensify pressure on the Chinese regime, rather than pursue a normalisation of relations that only enables further repression and allows the authorities to continue targeting reliable reporters.\"There are more than 120 journalists detained in China, according to RSF, which calls the country \"the world's biggest jailer of journalists\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoBethany BellReutersGerman left-wing activist Maja T. has been sentenced to eight years in prisonA German activist has been sentenced to eight years in a Hungarian prison for assaulting right-wing extremists and for being a member of an extreme left-wing group.The 25-year-old, identified only as Maja T., was found guilty of involvement in violent assaults by the group Antifa Ost in the lead-up to an annual commemoration of Nazi soldiers in Budapest.But supporters have raised concerns over whether Maja T., who identifies as non-binary, could receive a fair trial in the Hungarian court, because the country legally recognises only two genders and Pride marches are banned. Last year, Germany's Constitutional Court found Maja T. could face discriminatory treatment and said an extradition should not proceed. But the ruling came too late to stop the handover, as police in Germany had already delivered Maja T. to Hungarian authorities by helicopter in an overnight operation in 2024.The 25-year-old did not comment on the allegations during the trial and the verdict is subject to appeal.Antifa OstIn February 2023, far-right groups from across Europe gathered in Budapest to commemorate the anniversary of the end of the Second World War.The so-called Day of Honour marked an attempt in 1945 by the German Wehrmacht, the Waffen-SS, and their Hungarian collaborators to break through a Soviet siege of the city.The commemoration is tolerated by the Hungarian authorities.Between 9 and 11 February 2023, about 20 alleged left-wing extremists from Antifa Ost, a militant far-left multinational group also known as the \"hammer gang\", attacked people with batons, rubber hammers and pepper spray at several places in Budapest. Officials said the attackers believed their victims had participated in the commemoration.Nine people were injured in a number of incidents, four of them seriously. Prosecutors said Maja T. was involved in two attacks and part of a criminal organisation.German MEP Martin Schirdewan from the socialist Die Linke party described the proceedings as a \"political show trial\", and said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had \"deliberately exploited this trial for his election campaign\".\"Eight years in prison for Maja T. is disproportionate,\" he wrote. \"This is not about justice, but about setting a political example.\"Those trials are focused on the violence in Budapest and other incidents in Germany.The designation makes group members ineligible to enter the US, freezes any assets they may have there and makes it a crime to provide material support to the group.Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has called for Antifa Ost to be banned domestically.

    "body": "5 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersCommunal kitchens and heating centres are springing up as Kyiv runs out of power and heatingUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says more than 200 repair crews are working to restore power in Kyiv following widespread deadly Russian attacks targeting the country's energy sector. More than 1,100 apartment buildings in the capital are still without power, Zelensky said, adding that he had spoken to officials about supporting communities in other affected parts of Ukraine.In the eastern Ukrainian town of Druzhkivka, seven people were killed and fifteen injured in Russian cluster bomb strikes, the regional head said.Moscow has recently renewed its attacks after a week-long pause that US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.Meanwhile, US, Ukrainian and Russian officials are again meeting in Abu Dhabi to discuss details of a peace plan.However, there a few signs a breakthrough is imminent during the second round of such trilateral talks in the United Arab Emirates.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\"As of today, the toughest situation is in Kyiv and the region, Kharkiv and the region, Sumy region, and Poltava region,\" Zelensky wrote on social media on Wednesday.\"It is also difficult in other parts of central Ukraine, including Dnipro and Cherkasy regions.\"He added that more repair teams would be brought in to help restore power \"to ensure proper rotation of crew members - people are exhausted.\"Residents have been forced to spend the night sheltering in Kyiv's metro stations, with some pitching tents on the platforms to protect them from the freezing cold.Authorities have set up centres around the city for people to go to warm up. They are also importing more generators to cope with longer blackout periods as engineers try to fix the damage.In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, a power plant has been damaged beyond repair.Ukraine's Energy Minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country's energy system would take some time to fix. This includes Kyiv's Darnytsia Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant, which Shmyhal said had been \"severely damaged\". Iryna Vovk is a psychologist who lives in Kyiv with her daughter. Her husband is away fighting.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Vovk said she was considering moving to her parents' village because of the problems accessing electricity and water in the capital.\"Here in Kyiv, life is very awful,\" she said.Asked how her daughter is coping, Vovk said she was \"okay in general\".\"She tries to smile and lead a normal life but it's not a normal life. She cannot study [like] normal, she cannot use online lessons.\"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy sector on Monday night - as temperatures dropped to -20C (-4F) - were \"barbaric\" and \"particularly depraved\".He made the comments following a phone call with Trump hours after Russia hit power plants and critical infrastructure in Kyiv and elsewhere.Trump told reporters that Putin had \"kept his word\" on the week-long pause. The agreement \"was on Sunday, and he [Putin] went from Sunday to Sunday\", Trump said when asked whether he was disappointed with Russia's renewed attacks.\"It's a lot, you know, one week, we'll take anything, because it's really, really cold over there.\" The US president has been leading efforts to end the war, but his Russian counterpart has refused calls for a ceasefire.ReutersParts of a Russian drone among the debris at the site of a residential building in KyivThe Ukrainian Air Force said it was attacked by more than 100 drones early on Wednesday. While it had intercepted most of these, it added, drone strikes were reported in 14 locations, along with falling debris.Seven casualties were reported in Druzhkivka by Vadym Filashkin, the head of the eastern Donetsk region.He wrote on Telegram that Russians had hit the city with cluster shells, including a busy market.The head of Dnipropetrovsk's military administration, Oleksandr Ganzha, said a 68-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man were killed in a Russian attack.In the Zaporizhzhia region, leader Ivan Federov said three people were killed and 11 wounded, including children, during attacks on Tuesday evening that continued overnight. The Russian-controlled government in the neighbouring Luhansk region said a man and a woman were killed on Tuesday night in a drone attack, launched by Ukraine, which hit a minibus. In Russia itself, the governor of the western Bryansk region, Alexandra Bogomaz, said Ukraine had launched a \"combined attack\" including drones and long-range missiles - destroying a residential building and injuring one person.Further south in Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said work was continuing to restore power and water services following a Ukrainian missile strike there earlier in the week. Meanwhile, peace talks continue, with top US envoys again meeting negotiators from Russia and Ukraine in the UAE on Wednesday and Thursday. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, are joining teams of Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the capital, Abu Dhabi, to try and thrash out a US-proposed peace deal.The most difficult issue is territory, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cedes the rest of the eastern industrial region of Donbas that Moscow does not currently control. The first talks between the three parties, which were also held in Abu Dhabi, ended earlier this month with no apparent result.",

Gates's spokesperson has called the claim \"absolutely absurd\".The BBC has contacted his representatives for comments about his ex-wife's remarks. Bill Gates has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind. The billionaire has broken his silence on the release of files by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) in an interview with 9News in Australia. He said the interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners and that he did not visit Epstein's island. \"Every minute I spent with him I regret and I apologise that I did that,\" Gates added. 'It's false': Bill Gates on Epstein emailIn the interview with NPR's Wild Card podcast, Melinda French Gates said: \"For me, it's personally hard whenever those details come up, right? Because it brings back memories of some very, very painful times in my marriage.\"She added: \"Whatever questions remain there of what - I can't even begin to know all of it - those questions are for those people and for even my ex-husband. They need to answer to those things, not me.\"US media have reported that before their separation - which followed 27 years of marriage - Melinda French Gates had been upset about her husband's association with Epstein. After their split was announced, Bill Gates acknowledged having had an affair with a Microsoft employee in 2019. Two emails from 18 July 2013 appear to have been drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they were ever sent to Gates. Both were sent from Epstein's email account and back to the same account, while no email account associated with Gates is visible and both emails are unsigned.One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Bill \"to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".The other, which begins \"dear Bill\", complains about Bill Gates having ended a friendship and makes more claims about Bill Gates having tried to cover up a sexually transmitted infection, including from his then-wife, Melinda.In his interview with Australian media, Bill Gates added that the email was never sent and the contents of it were \"false\". Over the years, Bill Gates and his representatives have downplayed his connection with Epstein. He has previously said they only had \"several dinners\" to discuss a philanthropy project that did not happen. After the latest allegations, a spokesperson for Bill Gates said: \"The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame.\"They added: \"These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.\"Many of the documents, emails and photos included in the millions of files released by the DOJ last week shed light on Epstein's vast network of celebrities, business chiefs and world leaders - contacts that persisted in some cases even after his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl. Epstein died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial in a sex-trafficking case. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesThe New Start treaty caps the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for the US and Russia to 1,550 eachThe last nuclear weapons control treaty between the US and Russia is due to expire on Thursday, raising fears of a new arms race.  The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as \"New START\" and signed in 2010 was one of a handful of agreements designed to help prevent a catastrophic nuclear war.The treaty capped the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for each party to 1,550. It also established some transparency including data transfer, notifications and on site inspections.The treaty's expiry effectively marks an end to the arms control co-operation between Washington and Moscow that helped bring an end to the Cold War. On Wednesday, Pope Leo urged the US and Russia to renew the treaty, saying the current world situation required \"calls for doing everything possible to avert a new arms race\".The original Start treaty - signed in 1991 by the US and the Soviet Union - barred each of the two signatories from deploying more than 6,000 nuclear warheads.It was succeeded by New Start signed in 2010 in Prague by the US and Russia,  the successor state to the dissolved Soviet Union.Although Russia suspended the treaty three years ago as tensions grew over the Ukraine war, both countries were still thought to be abiding by the treaty.The agreement prevented the uncontrolled build-up of nuclear weapons and provided the two countries with the largest nuclear arsenals with transparency measures to avoid misjudging each other's intentions.Its expiry follows a worrying pattern. Other long-standing arms control treaties have already fallen by the wayside.They include: The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Agreement, which largely eliminated the deployment of shorter-range nuclear weapons within EuropeThe Open Skies Treaty, which allowed signatories, including the US and Russia, to fly unarmed reconnaissance flights over each other's territory to monitor military forces The Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which limited the numbers of tanks, troops and artillery systems both Russia and Nato forces could deploy within EuropeBritain's former head of the armed forces,  Admiral Sir Tony Radakin has warned that the architecture and frameworks that helped keep the world safe \"now risks  unravelling\". In a speech last year he described the collapse of these key arms control treaties as \"one of the most dangerous aspects of our current global security\", along with \"the increasing prominence of nuclear weapons\".Russia's Dmitry Medvedev, who as the then president signed the New Start treaty in 2010, said its expiration should \"alarm everyone\". This is a sobering comment from a politician whose recent rhetoric has included nuclear threats. On Wednesday, a senior adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin said he intended to \"act in a measured manner and responsibly\" if the treaty expired.Later in the day, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that \"in the current circumstances, we assume that the parties to the New START are no longer bound by any obligations or symmetrical declarations in the context of the Treaty, including its core provisions, and are in principle free to choose their next steps. \"In doing so the Russian Federation intends to act responsibly and in a balanced manner,\" the statement said, adding that Moscow \"remains ready to take decisive military-technical measures to counter potential additional threats to the national security\".US President Donald Trump has sounded less concerned. Last month, he told the New York Times: \"If it expires, it expires… We'll just do a better agreement\". Washington believes that any future arms control treaty should also include China, which has been building up its nuclear arsenal. Meanwhile, Russia has long argued that any future arms control treaty should include France and the UK - Europe's nuclear powers.Darya Dolzikova, a senior Research Fellow with the UK-based RUSI's Proliferation and Nuclear Policy Programme, said the expiration of New Start was \"concerning, because there are drivers on both sides to expand their strategic capabilities\".Both the US and Russia are currently modernising their nuclear forces and increasing their strategic capabilities. A new arms race is already under way. Dolzikova said that for Russia \"there appears to be some concerns about their ability to penetrate US air defences\". This has only increased with Trump's plans to build a \"Golden Dome\" to protect North America from long-range weapons.But Russia has also been developing new weapons designed to overcome air defences. They include Poseidon - a new intercontinental, nuclear armed and nuclear powered undersea autonomous torpedo, and also Burevestnik – a nuclear armed and powered cruise missile. The US, Russia and China are all developing long-range hypersonic missiles which can manoeuvre at speeds of more than 4,000 mph (6,437kmh), and are much harder to shoot down.Dolzikova said those expanding military capabilities would \"only make it harder\" to reach a new arms control treaty. This is along with what she called the \"growing salience of nuclear weapons\". More, not fewer, countries appear to want them as a deterrent.  Nor does the US or Russia appear to be in a rush to sign a new arms control treaty. The subject was on the agenda when Russian President Vladimir Putin met Trump in Alaska last year - but nothing happened. A new deal is still possible - but the expiry of the New Start signals a more volatile, dangerous era.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloNTB/Ane Hem via REUTERSA court sketch shows Marius Borg Høiby giving evidence The son of Norway's crown princess has told a court in Oslo he has lived a life of partying out of an extreme need of validation, on the second day of his trial for rape and more than 30 other alleged offences.Marius Borg Høiby, 29, looked overwhelmed by the occasion, his voice quivering as he paused several times to take off his glasses and wipe his eyes. Holding back tears, he said it was very difficult to talk, and complained of being followed by the press since he was three years old.He denies four allegations of rape as well as other serious charges against him. He was giving evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed \"100 percent\" that she had been drugged during an \"after-party\" in the basement of Høiby's parents' house in December 2018.The woman spoke of her sense of \"betrayal and shock\" after police showed her videos several years later, allegedly depicting him sexually assaulting her shortly after they had had brief, consensual sex.She had already spoken of a \"black hole\" in her memory and told the court behind closed doors that she had no recollection of what happened.The court has ordered the media not to give any information that might identify any of the four women. There is also a ban on any photos of Marius Borg Høiby, either inside the court building or on his way to and from the trial. The 29-year-old defendant, who was born four years before his mother, Mette-Marit, married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon, is not a member of the royal family or a public figure, but grew up as part of the wider family.During his first appearance in court on Tuesday, he was seen shaking. He is understood have had hospital treatment overnight. Høiby was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of assault and wielding a knife and remanded in custody for four weeks. However, he did not return to custody before his statement on Wednesday.He took a seat in court and after several minutes appearing to be overcome by the occasion, he regained his composure and told the court he had had a lot of sex, drugs and alcohol because he had an extreme need of validation.\"I am known for being Mamma's son. Nothing else,\" he told the three judges.\"Few can relate to the life I have led. A lot of parties, alcohol, some drugs.\"His trial comes at a tense moment for his mother, who was found to have exchanged hundreds of messages with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein over a three-year period.The royal palace said on Wednesday that Crown Princess Mette-Marit had postponed a private trip \"until further notice\", without giving further details.She has expressed regret and poor judgement over the correspondence.However, the storm of criticism over the unguarded, warm tone of the exchanges has heaped pressure on the royal house, when Mette-Marit is also seeing her son on trial for rape. Marius Borg Høiby was arrested in August 2024 after a violent incident at his girlfriend's flat in the Frogner area of western Oslo, when he is alleged to have torn down a chandelier, thrown a knife at the wall and shattered a mirror, while hurling abuse at her.At the time he spoke of having suffered for years with mental issues and admitted to substance abuse. After a lengthy police investigation, he was charged a large number of offences, ranging from rape, assault, threatening a girlfriend and damaging her flat, as well as drugs charges and driving offences. If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in jail.He is accused of raping four women between December 2018 and November 2024, all of them after consensual sex, and while they were either asleep or incapacitated. One of the charges involves full intercourse, and the other three sexual assault, which is also seen as rape in Norway.Wearing a dark blue woollen sweater over of a smart beige shirt, he looked straight at the three judges who were sitting about 10m (30ft) away from him. Later in the afternoon he removed the sweater.Although he had notes, he rarely looked down at them. He spoke for about half an hour without interruption.Høiby did not look to his left where two of the women he is alleged to have raped listened to his evidence a short distance away. The woman who gave evidence earlier did not stay in court.He spoke of how he met her at a party in 2018 and had taken cocaine for the first time.When he finished giving his statement, prosecutor Sturla Henriksbø asked him about the first alleged rape in 2018.The defendant disputed the account given earlier, and said he did not remember taking videos, denying they had had brief consensual sex for a few seconds in a toilet in his parents' basement. Instead he said they had had consensual sex after others at the after-party had gone to bed.Asked by the prosecutor if she had been awake when they had sex, he was adamant: \"I don't sleep with women who aren't awake.\"The 29-year-old has denied all but one of six counts of sexually offensive conduct without consent which includes filming graphic videos. In his testimony, he admitted filming a five-minute video of the woman in his family's basement, although he did not remember doing so.When pressed by the prosecutor how he could be sure she was awake in the video, he appeared to become frustrated, saying he had said \"a million times\" he did not remember the sequence of events.The woman's attorney, Heidi Reisvang, told the BBC that it had been extremely hard for her client to give evidence over two days and she was relieved it was over: \"The most important thing for her was to say she was not able to resist or give consent.\"Marius Borg Høiby also took aim at the Norwegian press, accusing them of twisting the facts, disputing a story that his mother had taken a sim-card out of his phone before it was handed to police at the time of his arrest in August 2024.He is due to continue giving evidence on Thursday.",

The arrest of Muharram, who has not yet commented, was made possible thanks to a series of intelligence-led operations, the agency said.Under Zambian law, marijuana is classed as a dangerous drug and is illegal to possess.The trafficking, possession and use of illegal drugs such as cannabis is punishable by a fine or a prison sentence.The southern Africa country struggles with drug abuse and trafficking, especially cannabis and heroin.During Tuesday's operations, the DEC said it had seized 221.2kg of cannabis hidden in a lorry in Lusaka's Lilayi area.The search was extended to Muharram's residence in Lilayi, where officers discovered an additional 1,159.6kg of \"high-grade\" cannabis, bringing the total seizure to 1,380.8kg, the agency added. A Zambian national who was also arrested is believed to be an accomplice in the organised drug-trafficking scheme.The DEC said their operations also saw the arrests of:A Zambian national for trafficking 55 boxes of Benylin containing codeine in LusakaTwo other Zambians for trafficking cannabis concealed in their vehicleTwo Burundian nationals in the southern district of Chirundu for trafficking cannabis in separate vehicles: some was hidden inside a spare lorry tyre, some in gas compressors and additional cannabis was mixed with sugar, salt and paint and concealed in tins and buckets of paint.\"All suspects have since been detained in lawful custody and will appear in court soon,\" DEC said in a statement. The agency said it was committed to ensuring that Zambia was neither used as a corridor nor a destination for drug trafficking.More BBC stories about Zambia:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoIan AikmanUS Navy via ReutersThe drone was \"aggressively\" approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln, a spokesman said (file photo) An Iranian drone was shot down as it \"aggressively approached\" an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, a US military spokesman has said.An F-35C stealth fighter jet which took off from the USS Abraham Lincoln warship shot down the drone \"in self-defence\" to protect the aircraft carrier and its personnel, US Central Command spokesman Capt Tim Hawkins said.The ship was approximately 500 miles from the Iranian coast when the drone approached it with \"unclear intent\".No US equipment was damaged and no service members were harmed.It comes as the US continues to build up a military presence in the region, with tensions high between Washington and Tehran.US President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if it does not negotiate an agreement to restrict its nuclear programme. Speaking after the downing of the Iranian drone, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that negotiations between the US and Iran are still scheduled for later this week.She said Trump \"remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first\", but added he \"has always a range of options on the table, and that includes the use of military force\".Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously warned that any attack on the country would spark a \"regional war\".Tehran has not commented on Tuesday's drone incident. In a separate incident on Tuesday, the US military said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces had \"harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel\" in the Strait of Hormuz - the world's busiest oil shipping channel.Military support \"de-escalated\" the situation and the tanker proceeded safely, Capt Hawkins said.Also on Tuesday, Leavitt said US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, will attend the talks on behalf of the White House.US media had previously reported he would meet Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Istanbul on Friday, with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also invited.But US news website Axios has since cited two sources as saying Tehran wanted the venue moved to Oman, with only Iranian and US officials present.The US had agreed to this request, the website reported, citing an Arab source. The BBC has reached out to the White House for comment. Ahead of the planned talks, Washington has repeatedly reminded Tehran of the US strikes on Iran last year, which Trump said had \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear enrichment facilities.He said a fresh attack would be \"far worse\" than those air strikes, which were launched last June during Israel's 12-day war with Iran.The Israeli military also targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and scientists during a short direct conflict, as well as its military commanders and missile arsenal.Tehran responded to the strikes by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. It also carried out a missile attack on a major US air base in Qatar.Iran has insisted its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Last week, Trump told reporters at the White House that Iranian officials \"do want to make a deal\", and that they must commit to \"no nuclear\" and to \"stop killing protesters\". The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,424 protesters, 152 children, 214 people associated with the government, and 58 bystanders. It is also investigating reports of another 11,280 deaths.Norway-based Iran Human Rights has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities have acknowledged that at least 3,117 people were killed, but said the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by \"rioters\".The unrest was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living, but it quickly developed into demands for political change.Khamenei described the unrest as \"sedition\" orchestrated by the US and Israel.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGuy De LauneyBalkans correspondentGetty ImagesA banner saying \"we won't surrender the Generalstab\" is held outside the ruins in BelgradeThe Trump International Hotel proposed for the Serbian capital Belgrade was supposed to mark a new chapter in the country's modern history. It would take the place of one of the city's most arresting sights: the bomb-damaged, but still semi-functional, remains of the defence ministry complex, or Generalstab (General Staff) as it is otherwise known.One major obstacle stood in the way: Generalstab was listed as cultural heritage.The government tried to get around this by removing the complex from the register of protected buildings but now Culture Minister Nikola Selakovic is on trial for abuse of office, accused of using his position to influence or falsify documents to revoke Generalstab's cultural heritage status.Prosecutors are calling for a three-year prison sentence, while President Aleksandar Vucic has promised to pardon the minister if judges convict him. Whatever the verdict, it now seems highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to check into a Trump International in Belgrade.ReutersThe project always had been a hard sell, given the recent history between the US and Serbia. US warplanes carried out the Nato air strikes in 1999 which reduced Generalstab to the shattered state in which it has remained.Bearing in mind that Washington was also the main sponsor of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, there is not an abundance of goodwill towards the US among Serbians.So there was a collective raising of eyebrows in 2024 when Serbia's government struck a deal with the US president's son-in-law Jared Kushner to redevelop Generalstab through his Affinity Global company. Surprise turned to outrage with his announcement last year that a Trump International Hotel would form the centrepiece of the project.Vucic insisted the time was right for Serbia to \"overcome the burden from 1999\". He told the BBC last year that his governing Progressive Party was \"ready to build better relations with the US\", saying: \"I think that is terribly important for this country.\"It soon became clear that many Serbs did not share that perspective – at least when it came to Generalstab. Opposition to Kushner's project brought together an unlikely coalition of architects, military veterans and student-led anti-corruption protesters.The architects pointed out that the bombed buildings had been the only project completed in Serbia by the renowned Yugoslav architect Nikola Dorbrovic, while the veterans saw them as a de facto memorial for the people who died in the 1999 air strikes. The students noted that the deal with Affinity Global had gone through without any tender process.EPA/ShutterstockAs well as maintaining business interests, Jared Kusher serves as an unofficial overseas envoy for his father-in-law's administration, including on Gaza and Ukraine talksNone of this stopped the government from trying to push through the project. In November, MPs passed special legislation to allow the Trump Hotel to be built.But prosecutors had also been keeping an eye on the affair, particularly efforts to remove Generalstab from the protected heritage register. That led to them bringing charges against the culture minister and three other officials in December.Selakovic responded by calling prosecutors an \"organised criminal group\" and an \"autoimmune disease\", accusing them of \"targeting the president\".But the charges proved one controversy too many for Kushner. His company stated they wanted to \"unite rather than divide\" and their withdrawal was \"out of respect for the citizens of Serbia and the City of Belgrade\".Vucic has made no secret of his fury. He has called the prosecution \"shameful and pathetic\" and \"disgusting political manipulation\".Last month, his governing party pushed through amendments to judicial legislation, despite critics' warnings that this would reduce the independence of prosecutors and judges.The EU's enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, described the laws as a \"serious step backwards\", saying they had been \"adopted in a very fast and non-transparent procedure, without any consultations\".Protesters have been back on the streets of Belgrade, this time outside the court where the minister is on trial. They held a banner reading \"we are all witnesses\".As for Kushner, his focus has switched to Albania, where he plans to build a luxury resort on Sazan Island. The country's Prime Minister Edi Rama says he is \"proud and happy\".It is not yet clear whether a Trump International Hotel is in the offing.",

It also accused the Israeli military of a \"grave violation\" of international humanitarian law, which protects medical personnel.The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was \"appalled\" to learn of Samiri's killing and stressed that it was \"unacceptable that first responders in Gaza continue to face risk to their lives while carrying out humanitarian mission\".The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike in al-Mawasi targeted a platoon commander of the elite Nukhba forces of Hamas's military wing, whom it named as Bilal Abu Assi. It alleged that he had led the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October 2023 and \"likely took part in holding deceased hostages captive throughout the war\".\"The IDF is aware of the claim that several uninvolved civilians, including a medical staff member, were hit in the strike. Prior to and during the strike, steps were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians,\" it added.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.On Sunday, more than 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza. The IDF said its forces launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in the southern Rafah area, beyond the Yellow Line.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 556 people have been killed by Israeli fire, while the Israeli military has said four of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJessica RawnsleyandHannah PriceGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Jeffrey Epstein asked an exotic dancer to \"engage in various sex acts\" at the late convicted sex offender's Florida home, a legal letter claims.In a letter released as part of the latest tranche of Epstein files, the unnamed woman's lawyers said she had been offered $10,000 to dance and that after she performed Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor had asked for a threesome.Lawyers said the woman had not been paid the promised amount and would keep the alleged 2006 encounter in which she was \"treated like a prostitute\" confidential in exchange for a payment of $250,000.BBC News has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has always denied any wrongdoing. The letter, dated March 2011, claims that the woman and other exotic dancers from \"Rachel's Strip Club\" in West Palm Beach had been chauffeured to Epstein's house and offered $10,000 to perform.The document claims that she had seen \"other young women dressed provocatively\" at the party, some of whom \"appeared to be as young as 14 years old\".After she arrived, she was directed upstairs where she was introduced by Epstein to Mountbatten-Windsor, the letter says.It alleges: \"My client then danced for the men, undressing until she was wearing only a bra and panties. Mr. Epstein and Prince Andrew then told my client they wanted to have a threesome.\"She said she was hired to dance, not to have sex. Mr Epstein said they would pay her later for dancing, and they prevailed upon her to engage in various sex acts.\"The letter claims that \"after the men had satisfied themselves\" she was invited to take a trip with the pair to the Virgin Islands, which she declined.Lawyers said she had only been paid $2,000 of the promised fee of $10,000.The woman had not previously pursued the claims because she was \"not proud of the circumstances of that night,\" the letter says. \"She was working as an exotic dancer, but she was treated like a prostitute.\"It is unclear whether the claim was ever settled.Getty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied always denied any wrongdoingEpstein also set up a London dinner between Mountbatten-Windsor and a 26-year-old Russian woman in August 2010, emails show.The woman later thanked Epstein describing it as an \"amazing night\" and describing her trip to London as \"a special adventure\".In the emails Epstein contacts the former prince on 11 August saying he has a friend \"I think you might enjoy having dinner with\".He describes the woman as \"26, russian, clevere [sic] beautiful, trustworthy\" after Andrew says he would be \"delighted to see her\" and inquires if there is any information about her that might be \"useful to know\".The correspondence and suggested meeting came two years after Epstein was convicted for soliciting prostitution for a minor and registered as a sex offender.The Russian woman contacted Epstein on 8 August 2010 asking for his advice: \"If I go to London (on my way back from Russia) sometime between August 27 and Sept 5 do you think somebody will be there and what are the best dates?\"After Epstein replies suggesting dates that are \"best\", the woman confirms she has booked tickets and will be in London between the 20 and 25 August.Later that day is when Epstein wrote to Mountbatten-Windsor to suggest the dinner with his \"friend\": \"her name is [redacted] she will be london [sic] 20-24\".The former prince replied: \"Of course. I am in Geneva until the morning of 22nd but would be delighted to see her. Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch.\"Adding in a further email: \"Great. Any other information you might know about her that might be useful to know? Like what have you told her about me and have you given her my email as well?\"The next day Epstein wrote to the Russian woman saying, \"the evening of the 22 nd confimed [sic]\".She replies: \"Great!!!!!!! Should I email him [Andrew's email address] I can't wait! Thank you\".While the emails do not confirm if the dinner definitely went ahead, in correspondence the Russian woman responds to an email from Epstein on 22 August asking \"but [sic] are you having fun\" saying \"I had an amazing night, thank you!\"On 25 August she sends a further email to Epstein saying she was going to Russia and thanking him for everything. \"My trip has been a really special adventure.\"The correspondence seen by the BBC suggests Epstein arranged for the Russian woman to meet male associates of his internationally on more than one occasion.Emails from August 2010 indicate that the woman flew to London via the Bahamas, where Epstein made arrangements for her to visit \"Eduardo\". The BBC understands this to be Eduardo Teodorani, an Italian businessman and chairman and vice president at the Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the UK.The BBC has contacted Teodorani for comment.Mountbatten-Windsor is under mounting pressure to give evidence about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender.Photographs appearing to show the former prince kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground were included in the latest batch of Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice on Friday. Both are fully clothed. He has faced allegations, which he has repeatedly denied, that he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre as a teenager after she said she was trafficked by Epstein.Mountbatten-Windsor paid a financial settlement to Giuffre to settle a civil sexual assault claim in 2022.More on this story",

    "body": "Libyan prosecutors launch probe into killing of Gaddafi's son8 hours agoNick Springate,Maia DaviesandWycliffe MuiaReutersIt is not clear who killed Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who still had political ambitionsLibyan prosecutors say they are investigating the killing of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the country's long-time leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. The 53-year-old, who was once widely seen as his father's heir apparent, was killed during a \"direct confrontation\" with four unknown gunmen who broke into his home in the city of Zintan, his office said in a statement. \"The victim died from wounds by gunfire,\" Libyan prosecutors said on Wednesday, adding that efforts were under way to identify the gunmen. In a different version of events, his sister told Libyan TV that he had died near the country's border with Algeria.Saif al-Islam's lawyer told the AFP news agency a \"four-man commando\" unit carried out an assassination at his home in the city of Zintan, though it was not clear who may have been behind the attack.The public prosecutor's office said forensic experts had been dispatched to Zintan in north-west Libya to conduct investigations. Saif al-Islam was long seen as the most influential and feared figure in the country after his father, who ruled Libya from 1969 until being ousted and killed during an uprising in 2011.BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson, who had met Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, said that he was \"a strange, mercurial figure, but he was much less eccentric than his father\".\"During the 2011 revolution, he agreed to be interviewed for the BBC, only to scream insults at me in front of his officials,\" Simpson said.\"Then he sent them away, and apologised profusely. 'They expect it of me,' he said.\"According to Libyan journalist and writer Abdulkader Assad, Saif al-Islam might have been targeted by locals who felt their political influence was being threatened by his popularity.\"It could also be foreign actors took him out because of his controversial past,\" Abdulkader told the BBC's Newsday programme.Born in 1972, he played a key role in Libya's rapprochement with the West from 2000 until the collapse of the Gaddafi regime.After his father's removal, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi - who was accused of playing a key role in the brutal repression of anti-government protests - was jailed by a rival militia in the city of Zintan for almost six years.The International Criminal Court (ICC) wanted to put him on trial for crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the suppression of opposition protests in 2011. In 2015, he was given a death sentence in absentia for his role in the crackdown by a court in Tripoli, in the west of the country, where control is in the hands of the UN-backed government.But he was released by militia in Tobruk, in the east, under an amnesty law two years later.Simpson attended his trial in Zintan.\"In the courtroom he greeted me and my television crew with relief, maybe thinking that our presence would save him from execution,\" he said.\"But he had great faith in his negotiating skills and his personal charm, and he managed to win over his captors, who eventually freed him. \"But the loathing many Libyans felt for his father extended to him, and may have brought about his death.\"Since the overthrow of Gaddafi, Libya has been split into areas controlled by various militias and is currently divided between two rival governments.During his father's time as leader, he shaped policy and led high-profile negotiations despite having no official role in government, including those which led his father to abandon his nuclear weapons programme.Such agreements saw international sanctions on the north African country lifted, and some considered Gaddafi a reformist and acceptable face of a changing Libya.Gaddafi had always denied that he wanted to inherit power from his father, saying the reins of power were \"not a farm to inherit\".However, in 2021 he announced he would run for the presidency in elections which were then postponed indefinitely.More BBC stories on Libya:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "7 hours agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgGallo via Getty ImagesJohn Steenhuisen has served as the Democratic Alliance leader since 2019South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen has said he will not seek re-election as the party's leader in April - a move that may threaten the stability of the coalition government.The DA, South Africa's second largest party, entered into a coalition with its arch rival the African National Congress in 2024 after the ANC lost its parliamentary majority.Steenhuisen took over leadership of the pro-business DA in 2019 and currently serves as agriculture minister in President Cyril Ramaphosa's government.The 49-year-old was widely expected to run again but was reportedly forced to abandon his bid because of several controversies.\"For the rest of this term of office, I will focus all of my time and energy as minister of agriculture on defeating the most devastating foot-and-mouth disease outbreak our country has ever seen,\" he told a press conference.Steenhuisen began his political career aged 22 when he was elected to the council of the the port city of Durban for the Democratic Party, the DA's predecessor.He rose up through the party's local and then regional leadership before becoming leader of the party, which traditionally has a white support base, two decades later.It was widely reported that Steenhuisen would run unopposed for the leadership at the DA's upcoming conference.But it seems a variety of issues led to his decision not to do so, including his fallout with another senior DA member, ex-Environment Affairs Minister Dion George, and allegations, of which he was cleared in January, that he had abused his party credit card.He has also been criticised for his handling of the foot-and-mouth outbreak, with farmers accusing his department of being an \"obstacle in a crisis\", according to South Africa's News24 website.The country has struggled over the past four years to contain the highly infectious virus that has now spread to most the country's provinces - badly affecting the livestock industry.It causes blisters inside an animal's mouth and under their hooves, which can cause lameness and problems feeding. In dairy cattle, milk yields will be lost and the cattle's value will be permanently reduced.Under Steenhuisen, the DA party agreed to join the ANC as its biggest partner in the government of national unity nearly two years ago.It was an historic moment for the country as the ANC, the party that  brought in democratic rule in 1994 with Nelson Mandela and ended white-minority rule, had lost its parliamentary majority.As expected it has been a fractious political marriage, but despite some differences they have stayed together - and Steenhuisen and Ramaphosa have shown how the partnership can work.This was best exemplified when they supported each other in the Oval Office showdown with US President Donald Trump in May last year.After Trump confronted the delegation with a video in support of discredited claims of a white genocide in South Africa, it was Steenhuisen who assured the US president that the majority of white farmers wanted to stay in the country.Their performance proved to South Africans that the government of national unity was worth the bickering at home.No DA leaders have announced their candidacies for the top post yet, but Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis has been touted as a possible successor. Steenhuisen and Hill-Lewis are close and the latter has repeatedly said he would not run against his friend, according to the TimesLive news site.More BBC stories on South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

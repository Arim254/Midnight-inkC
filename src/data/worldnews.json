    "body": "5 hours agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonSwiss prosecutors say the French managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people have been placed under criminal investigation.The blaze at Le Constellation in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve injured 119 other people, officials have said. With many of the injured identified, families now face an agonising wait for information about those still missing.The bodies of two Swiss women aged 21 and 16, and two Swiss men aged 18 and 16 were the first to be indentified and returned to their families, police said earlier.The likely cause of the fire was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation of how the fire began found. The French managers of Le Constellation are suspected of having committed homicide by negligence, causing bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in the canton of Valais said in a statement on Saturday afternoon.Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin called it \"one of the worst tragedies\" experienced by the country.Further details about the identified victims, including names, have not been released.On Friday, police said 113 of the injured have been identified, and include 71 Swiss, 14 French and 11 Italian citizens.Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process was continuing on Saturday and should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

A BBC spokesperson said that while they did not generally comment on specific legal issues they were pleased to have reached an agreement in the case.Tzeela Horenstein said gunmen threw a grenade at her husband Simon during Hamas' attack on the village of Netiv HaAsara early in the morning of 7 October. The couple and their two young children only survived because their home's door twisted and jammed when the attackers tried to blow it out with explosives, she told the Jewish News, who first reported the story.She said: \"Not only did terrorists break into our home and try to murder us, but then the BBC crew entered again, this time with a camera as a weapon, without permission or consent.\"It was another intrusion into our lives. We felt that everything that was still under our control had been taken from us.\"The Jewish News reported that the corporation paid a financial settlement of £28,000 to the family. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Two people including a three-year-old child have been killed and around 28 others injured in a Russian strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A multi-storey residential apartment block was almost completely destroyed in the dual missile attack on Friday afternoon, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called \"heinous\". Russia's Defence Ministry denied reports of an attack, suggesting the blast had been caused by Ukrainian ammunition detonating.The strike comes ahead of crunch talks on a US-brokered peace plan in Kyiv on Saturday.Zelensky says around 15 countries are expected to attend the talks, along with representatives from the EU and Nato, with a US delegation joining the meeting via video link. Leaders of the so-called coalition of the willing are then set to meet in France on 6 January.Officials in Kharkiv said the bodies of a woman and a three-year-old child were found in the rubble, with preliminary information suggesting the pair may have been a mother and son. \"Unfortunately, this is how the Russians treat life and people – they continue killing, despite all efforts by the world, and especially by the United States, in the diplomatic process,\" Zelensky wrote on X.Of the 28 injured, which included a six-month-old baby, 16 have been taken to hospital. A search and rescue operation is ongoing, with more than 80 volunteers working at the scene, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that its armed forces \"neither planned nor launched attacks using missile weapons or aircraft weapons within the city of Kharkiv\".It added that footage from before the attack showed \"heavy smoke of unknown origin\", which it cited as evidence of ammunition detonated by Ukrainian armed forces.The ministry also alleged that the reports were seeking to distract attention from a New Year's Eve strike on a hotel in a Russian-held part of the southern Kherson region of Ukraine.Russia has accused Ukraine of killing at least 27 people and injuring more than 30 others in the drone strike on a New Year's party in the village of Khorly on the Black Sea.The BBC has not been able to independently verify either these claims or the number of casualties.Ukraine told the BBC it would not directly respond to sources of information such as claims from governors of occupied regions.It added that it adhered to the norms of international humanitarian law and conducted strikes exclusively against military targets.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened an investigation into the attack, while the Russian foreign ministry accused Zelensky of \"seeking to intimidate the populations of the reunited Russian regions, who have forever linked their fates with Russia through referendums\".",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" of demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.Meanwhile, an Iranian police spokesman said officers would not allow what he called \"enemies\" to turn \"unrest into chaos\".Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while and another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the country's Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi-Azad warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with a \"decisive response\".This stance was echoed by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said it was \"completely fair\" that shopkeepers protest the economic situation, but that any \"rioters must be put in their place\".Iran's UN Ambassador Amir-Saeid Iravani called on the UN Security Council to condemn Trump's statement in letter to the secretary-general and president of the Security Council on Friday, news agency Reuters reported. \"Iran will exercise its rights decisively and proportionately. The United States of America bears full responsibility for any consequences arising from these unlawful threats and any ensuing escalation,\" he wrote in the letter.",

He led a long life and no doubt fathered many calves,\" said the Amboseli Trust for Elephants in its farewell message.Famed for his long tusks, Craig the elephant was a major attraction at the park near the Tanzanian border. In 2021, he was named an ambassador for the popular Kenyan lager brand Tusker - a name also used for adult male elephants with tusks.The Kenya Wildlife Service described Craig as an \"icon\" of successful conservation.\"Craig was one of the last remaining super tuskers in Africa - a rare class of bull elephants whose two tusks weigh over 45kg (100lb) each. Fewer than a handful remain today, making him a living monument to Africa's natural heritage.\"The wildlife body also said \"Craig was deeply loved for [his] remarkably calm nature\", often \"pausing patiently as visitors photographed and filmed him\". \"Thanks to his many protectors, he died peacefully of natural causes.\"More than two million tourists visited Kenya last year, many of them seeking out wildlife in the country's world-famous national parks.Kenya's tourism sector accounts for 10% of national GDP, officials say.AFP via Getty ImagesCraig the elephant became a brand ambassador for Tusker five years agoYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

Mexico is situated in one of the world's most seismically active areas, sitting at the meeting point of four tectonic plates.Late on Friday night, Brugada said power has been restored to \"98% of the failures reported\" in Mexico City.Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, she said, while 34 buildings and five homes were being inspected as a preventative measure.Damage assessments are under way in Mexico City after roads and hospitals were impacted, according to news agency Reuters, while authorities noted various landslides on highways around the Guerrero state. Mexico's seismological service had registered 420 aftershocks by midday local time (18:00 GMT).President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.  In a video capturing the moment, Sheinbaum can be heard saying \"it's shaking\" as an earthquake alert system rings in the background. She then tells the media to \"all get out calmly\". Additional footage shows buildings shaking in Mexico City and cars trembling in Acapulco.Getty ImagesThe inside of a house damaged by the quake in San Marcos, Guerrero state, MexicoAfter hearing the Mexican Seismic Alert System early on Friday, residents and tourists rushed into the streets of Mexico City and Acapulco.The seismic system was put into place following the deadly 1985 earthquake that claimed more than 10,000 lives.In 2017, a 7.1 magnitude quake killed more than 200 people and toppled dozens of buildings in Mexico City.",

    "body": "2 days agoMayeni JonesAfrica correspondent, JohannesburgChristian Parkinson / BBCArnold Ncube was unable to complete his education because he could not prove he was South AfricanMany people may take their birth certificate, or similar official papers, for granted - hidden in a drawer and rarely seeing the light of day - but for those without one, it can lead to a shadow life or an uncertain existence.This is thought to affect millions of people around the world, described as stateless, and 25-year-old South African Arnold Ncube is one of those.Because he has no state-issued documents, washing cars in the backstreets of Thembisa township near Johannesburg is one of the few ways he can make a living.He was born in Johannesburg and his father is South African, qualifying him for citizenship here. But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.Ed Habershon / BBCChristy Chitengu only found out at 17 that she was statelessHuman rights lawyer and advocate Christy Chitengu used to be stateless herself.She only got South African citizenship three years ago with the help of the organisation Lawyers for Human Rights who worked on her case for free.\"I found out I was stateless at the age of 17. My high school principal called me into her office and told me that she didn't have any documents for me and that she didn't understand how I'd gotten into the school,\" she tells the BBC near her home in northern Johannesburg.\"I was born in Johannesburg to two foreign parents [both from Zimbabwe] and at my birth I was given a handwritten South African birth certificate.\"But officials in South Africa need a printed certificate.Christy says that when she found out she was stateless she looked into taking her parents' nationality but it was too late.\"I couldn't claim my Zimbabwean citizenship because by that time I was 16 and they wouldn't allow me to do a late birth registration. Also I would have had to physically leave South Africa to get a Zimbabwean passport and without any documents to leave the country, I wouldn't be allowed back in.\"South Africa has large numbers of undocumented migrants and the authorities and local vigilante groups have been trying to crack down on irregular migration for years.When asked whether giving stateless children citizenship could be seen as a reward to undocumented migrants who give birth in South Africa, Christy disagrees.\"I think citizenship is not a reward. It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being. I think if we look at it through that lens, we realise that there's nothing that we lose by recognising a child who would otherwise not be able to go to primary school or receive healthcare.\"Getty ImagesIn South Africa, an estimated 10,000 people are stateless On several occasions, the BBC contacted the home affairs department, which handles immigration issues in South Africa, to find out how it is tackling the issue of statelessness but got no reply.Statelessness is not just an issue here, it is a huge global problem.There's an estimated 4.5 million stateless people around the world. Some say the figure could even be as high as 15 million.Experts believe tackling the problem requires policy changes, including allowing refugees to register their children where they're born, and giving mothers the right to pass their nationality to their children.\"For us statelessness is not just a legal issue, it's a matter that involves the right to development,\" says Jesus Perez Sanchez who works for the UNHCR.\"That person that's affected by statelessness will not be able to contribute fully to that country that is hosting. So we think that it's important that as a matter of inclusion, all issues of statelessness are addressed so that all these people on the margins of society can contribute fully to society and the economy.\"Back in Thembisa, Arnold is playing football with local children.After years of struggle, he now has a lawyer helping him fight for the papers that prove he belongs here. He wants to go back to school to study computer science. He hopes having documents will lead to a brighter future.Additional reporting by Christian ParkinsonMore from South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "23 hours agoJaroslav LukivandVitaliy Shevchenko,Russia editor, BBC MonitoringUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has named spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as his new chief of staff, just over a month after his previous top aide resigned in a corruption row.\"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues,\" Zelensky said in a social media post, alongside a photo of his meeting with Gen Budanov in Kyiv.The 39-year-old has until now led the Hur military intelligence, which has claimed a number of highly effective strikes against Russia.Zelensky also said he intended to replace his defence minister Denys Shmyhal, appointing his current minister of digital transformation Mykhaylo Fedorov to take up the post.Budanov's predecessor, Andriy Yermak, wielded enormous political influence throughout Russia's full-scale invasion, which began in 2022. He also led Ukraine's negotiating team in crucial talks with the US aimed at ending the war.Zelensky wrote on Friday: \"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the defence and security forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations. \"Kyrylo has specialist experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results.\" The president added that he had already instructed his new office chief to update and present key documents regarding \"the strategic foundations\" of Ukraine's defence.The chief of presidential staff in Ukraine is historically a very powerful position. There was a time in the 2000s when a presidential administration head in Ukraine wielded about as much power as the president himself.Ostensibly administrative, the role traditionally offered not just close access to the head of state, but also plentiful opportunities to pull the strings of government.For example, the chief of presidential staff could lobby for government appointments and apply pressure to business circles, often resulting in personal gain.Budanov's appointment suggests an intention to overhaul the role. It puts the president's office on a war footing - it will very likely be much more focused on security and the war with Russia.Later on Friday, Zelensky announced other changes to his top team. He said Fedorov had been nominated to serve as his new defence minister because he had \"decided to change the structure of the Ukrainian ministry of defence\".Federov, aged 34, is the youngest minister in the Ukrainian government. His key achievement so far is the development and implementation of Diya, a centralised digital platform for government services.He is \"deeply involved with drones\", and will be tasked in particular with training more drone operators, Zelensky said in his evening address. He added that Shmyhal remains \"part of the team\" and will be moved to another area of work.Zelensky said Budanov was being replaced by 56-year-old foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko.Budanov's predecessor, former chief of staff Yermak, 54, stepped down on 28 November, and his departure was seen as a major blow to Zelensky.Yermak quit shortly after his home in Kyiv was raided by the country's anti-corruption agencies. He is not accused of any wrongdoing, and the anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office Sap did not explain why they searched his property. In the past few months investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position at a delicate time.Kyiv, backed by its European allies, is seeking to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Russian officials have seized on the scandal, talking up corruption claims.",

    "body": "'Living a nightmare': Families of teens missing after ski resort fire desperate for news11 hours agoAleks PhillipsSuppliedThe families of teenagers missing after a fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort are facing an agonising wait for news and appealing for information about their loved ones online.The fire in Crans-Montana was likely caused by sparklers placed on bottles of champagne that came \"too close to the ceiling\", Swiss officials said on Friday.An investigation into the fire will focus on the materials used at the site, the bar's fire safety measures, its capacity and the number of people inside at the time, Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said.Swiss authorities have said it could take days if not weeks to identify the victims of the fire, which killed 40 people and injured another 119. Officials said 113 of the injured had been identified, with authorities still working to identify the other six.In the meantime, families and friends have been taking to social media to appeal for information about their loved ones who were at the bar that night.What we know so farSparklers on champagne bottles likely cause of fireWatch as partygoers try to put out flamesCharlotte Niddam/TikTokAmong the missing is thought to be 15-year-old Charlotte Niddam, a former student at schools in the UK.The Jewish Free School in north-west London called for \"love and prayers\", saying Charlotte had been a student there for two years before her family moved back to France.\"She is loved by so many within JFS and is friends with many in our community,\" it added.A statement from Immanuel College - a private Jewish school in Hertfordshire - widely reported in the UK press said her family had \"asked that we all keep them in our thoughts and prayers during this extremely difficult time\". It added: \"We are all praying for a miracle for Charlotte and the others.\"Crans-Montana's tourism website lists her as a babysitter in the resort during school holidays.Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookSwiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, is among the missingThe whereabouts of Swiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, are currently unknown, his mother Laetitia said.\"I must find my son... it's been 30 hours since [he] disappeared,\" she told the BBC, adding that she wanted his photo \"to be everywhere so that, just in case, someone recognises him, they can call me\".Ms Brodard said that she and Arthur's father had been checking hospitals in Lausanne and Bern, but could not find him, earlier telling local newspaper Le Temps that she was \"living a nightmare.\"Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"SUPPLIEDAchille Barosi was described by his aunt as an avid painterAnother missing Italian national is Achille Osvaldo Giovanni Barosi, 16, who entered the bar at 01:30 local time on New Year's Day to retrieve his jacket and phone. His family have not heard from him since.\"We don't know if he's still alive,\" his aunt Francesca told the BBC World Service's OS programme.She described her nephew, who is enrolled in an art school in Milan, as a beautiful boy and an excellent painter.\"We just want to find him, and that's it.\"The Italian foreign ministry has said six of its citizens remain missing.Italian Golf FederationJunior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, was last heard from around midnight on New Year's Eve, according to his fatherAmong them is Emanuele Galeppini, a 16-year-old junior golfer, originally from Genoa but now living in Dubai.The Italian Golf Federation has said he is dead, without mentioning the fire, paying tribute to a \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father, Edoardo, is quoted by Italian TV channel TG24 as saying his son was at the bar and was last heard from around midnight. An Italian foreign ministry spokesperson has told the BBC that it was not confirming the death yet.Giovanni Tamburi, 16, is also among the missing. His mother, Carla Masiello, from Bologna, told La Repubblica that he had been on holiday with his father but had gone out with friends and ended up at La Constellation.\"A close friend of his told me they ran away after the fire broke out and that he had [his phone] with him, but then at a certain point he couldn't see him anymore,\" she told the newspaper, adding he had been wearing a gold chain with a small Madonna around his neck.Tania Causio, one of his teachers at Porta Saragozza High School, told La Repubblica: \"I've always been struck by his kindness and smile, coupled with great maturity.

    "body": "Young Italian golfer feared dead: What we know about Swiss resort fire22 hours agoBen TobiasandPatrick JacksonItalian Golf FederationEmanuele Galeppini, an Italian golfer, is feared dead in the blazeA fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort has killed 40 people and injured another 119, officials say.The bar, Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana, was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating New Year's Day in the early hours of Thursday when the blaze began in the basement area.Prosecutors say that, according to initial investigations, the likely cause of the fire was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling.Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin called it \"one of the worst tragedies\"  experienced by the country.A teenage golfer from Italy is the first victim to be named by media, though not officially.Families of missing teenagers are facing an agonising wait for information, as most of the 40 victims and six of those injured are yet to be identified.LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fireA helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117Here is what we know so far. Italian golfer Emanuele Galeppini feared deadSeveral media outlets have named Italian golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as the first identified victim of the fire following a statement from the Italian Golf Federation.A spokesperson for the Italian foreign ministry told the BBC it was not confirming this.In a tribute, the Italian Golf Federation called Emanuele a \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\". But the statement does not mention the fire in Switzerland.Local Italian media previously reported Emanuele's father had said his son was at the bar on the night of the fire, and that the family had last had contact with him at midnight.The Italian foreign ministry has said six of its citizens remain missing.France has also said eight of its citizens are missing and it cannot rule out that French nationals are among the dead. One Belgian citizen was still missing as well, Belgium's foreign affairs department told the BBC.Police commander Frédéric Gisler confirmed on Friday that 113 of the 119 people injured had been formally identified.Those identified include: 71 Swiss citizens14 French11 ItalianFour SerbsOne BosnianOne BelgianOne citizen from LuxembourgOne Polish citizenOne PortugueseHe warned the figures might change. The Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade also said an Australian had been injured in the fire and was now receiving medical care.Many of those injured in the fire remain in a critical condition \"and are still fighting to live\", Mathias Reynard, president of the Valais region, said.French football club FC Metz said one of its youth players had been \"severely burned\" in the fire. Tahirys Dos Santos, 19, was airlifted to a hospital in Germany for treatment, it added.The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.ReutersWhat may have caused the fire? Béatrice Pilloud, the attorney-general of the Valais region, said everything led investigators to believe the fire had started from sparklers attached to bottles of champagne.\"Everything leads us to think that the fire started from sparkling candles - or sparklers - which were put on bottles of champagne and that was moved too close to the ceiling,\" she told reporters on Friday. \"From that, a blaze began very quickly.\"She said that the two French managers of the bar had been interviewed as well as people who escaped the fire.BBC Verify has verified two photos showing lit sparklers attached to bottles inside the bar which were shared online with claims they had been taken around the start of the fire, at 01:30 (00:30 GMT).One image shows people holding several bottles in the air with lit sparklers attached and what appears to be a fire on the ceiling.The second image shows someone in a sleeveless black dress and crash helmet holding a bottle with a lit sparkler attached, on the shoulders of someone wearing a mask.SUPPLIEDWhat do we know about the evacuation?Earlier, Ms Pilloud had said an investigation would look into whether the bar had met safety standards and had possessed the required number of exits.Investigators will be examining  safety measures in place such as the use of fireproof materials.Among materials that will be examined, RTL TV suggests, is a layer of foam that appears to have been applied to the ceiling of the basement, possibly for sound-proofing.Two French nationals who spoke to BFMTV described the evacuation as \"very difficult\" because the escape route was \"narrow\" and the stairs to get outside \"even narrower\". A survivor called Axel, who had been in the basement of the bar, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency that he did not know how he had \"miraculously\" made it outside.He turned over a table and sheltered behind it to protect himself from the fire, before making his way upstairs. \"We couldn't see anything, I was half choking,\" he said. He eventually broke a window to get out, avoiding what he said was a single door that was too narrow for the many people trying to escape.At an earlier news conference, Ms Pilloud did not confirm if the stairs were narrow, adding that investigations would assess whether they were in line with requirements. She said it was too early to comment on any safety failures.  The bar's owner told local media the establishment had been inspected three times in the past ten years and that \"everything was done according to the regulations\".'I hid from a wall of heat': Eyewitnesses describe escapeDisbelief as tragedy hits ski resort on New Year's DayWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireLe Constellation is a large bar which has been around for many years. Although the resort of Crans-Montana itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reports from the resort.Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were probably drinking and dancing. It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts.A promotional video posted on YouTube for Le Constellation, published in May 2024, showed women in motorcycle helmets walking through the bar while carrying sparklers in alcohol bottles above their heads.The caption, written in French, read: \"The Constellation Crans-Montana welcomes you every day from 9am to 2am, 365 days a year without interruption.\"Police Cantonale ValaisannePolice have released images from inside the bar after the fire showing chairs and benches strewn across the roomCorrection 2 January: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the attorney general said the staircases appeared to be narrow. This was a result of an error in the live broadcast translation of the press conference and the story has since been amended.Clarification 2 January: This story earlier stated 14 Polish citizens were believed to have been injured in the fire. In fact, Poland had offered to treat 14 people in its hospitals. Authorities on Friday said one Polish citizen has been injured.",

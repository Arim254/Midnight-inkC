    "body": "10 hours agoMax MatzaCBSThe co-owner of a Colorado funeral home where nearly 200 decaying bodies were found has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for corpse abuse.Before Jon Hallford was sentenced, he apologised in court and listened to family members describe having nightmares about their loved ones decomposing in his care. They called him a \"monster\" who should rot in jail.His ex-wife and co-owner Carie Hallford has pleaded guilty to similar charges and is awaiting sentencing.The Return to Nature home, in the town of Penrose, Colorado, had given fake ashes to grieving relatives instead of their loved-ones' remains. Prosecutors said 189 bodies were improperly stored in the building over four years.The courthouse was packed with family members on Friday, who asked the judge to impose the maximum 50-year sentence.\"I'm a daughter whose mother was treated like yesterday's trash and dumped in a site left to rot with hundreds of others,\" Kelly Mackeen told the court.\"I'm heartbroken, and I ask God every day for grace.\"The bodies were found in piles inside non-refrigerated areas of the funeral home. Victims included children and foetuses.\"It is my personal belief that every one of us, every human being, is basically good at the core,\" Judge Eric Bentley said.\"But we live in a world that tests that belief every day, and Mr Hallford, your crimes are testing that belief.\" Hallford, who had pleaded guilty in the hopes of a reduced sentence, apologised for his actions ahead of sentencing.\"I had so many chances to put a stop to everything and walk away, but I did not,\" he said. \"My mistakes will echo for a generation. Everything I did was wrong.\"Prosecutors say the couple was driven by \"greed\", and were earning enough money from the business to properly care for the bodies.Located about 30 miles (48km) south of Colorado Springs, the funeral home specialised in burials where no chemicals, including embalming fluid, were used and where remains were buried in a biodegradable casket.The business came under investigation after reports of a foul odour coming from the property. Officials discovered 115 bodies there early last October.Jon Hallford was accused by officials of attempting to conceal the \"improper storage of human remains\".Green funerals are allowed in the state but remains must be buried within 24 hours or be properly refrigerated.Funeral home operators in Colorado are currently not required to be licensed, have a degree in mortuary science or even graduate high school.Tougher legislation has been passed since the scandal erupted.",

    "body": "Coin portrait of late Queen draws criticism in Australia 1 day agoKathryn ArmstrongRoyal Australian Mint$5 and 50 cent versions of the coin have been released to mark the centenary of Queen Elizabeth II's birthTwo commemorative coins, released by the Royal Australian Mint and bearing a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, have been criticised for their lack of resemblance to the late monarch.The $5 (£2.56) and 50 cent silver coins, created to commemorate the centenary of the Queen's birth, were released in an online ballot that closed on Wednesday.\"That's got to be the most unpleasant portrait on a coin,\" said one of several people who reacted negatively online. The Royal Australian Mint defended the portrait, saying: \"Our coin images don't always capture the full beauty of a design once it's etched in metal.\"Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96 and was the UK's longest serving monarch. \"There's a reason most portraits are from the side. Looks like she just ran into a wall,\" one person commented underneath a Facebook post from the mint.\"If I saw that face without the hairdo and pearls, would never guess who it was meant to be,\" another said.Comparisons have been made with various TV characters, including Mrs Doubtfire - the beloved fictional housekeeper in the comedy film of the same name, played by the late Robin Williams.Royal Australian MintOther people were more positive about the design, which was created by one of the mint's artists. \"Awesome. I'm glad they put something out to do with Queen Elizabeth II, she deserves to have Recognition In a Special Way,\" one user wrote on social media.\"Please pick me for one of these coins,\" said another. One woman living in the US commented that it \"looks like a beautiful coin\". Despite the criticism, collectors reported that the ballot was fully subscribed. Australian media, quoting a spokesperson for the Royal Australian Mint, said the silver proof coins had sold out, and there were limited stocks left in their contact centre and shop.According to the mint's website, it created 30,000 of the 50c coins and 5,000 of the $5 - all of which are collector's items and will not enter general public circulation.As well as the queen's portrait, the coins feature designs \"symbolically reflecting the many facets of Queen Elizabeth II's life and legacy\", the mint said. These include motifs of a horse and corgi, references to art and theatre to mark \"her enduring support for culture\", as well as some of her favourite flowers - roses and lily of the valley. The golden wattle, Australia's national floral emblem, is also represented. \"The design incorporates Her Majesty's Royal Cypher, a stylised St Edward's Crown and the Auxiliary Territorial Service emblem, acknowledging her wartime service and lifelong sense of duty,\" the mint added.Meanwhile, the backs of the coins feature a portrait of the Queen's son, King Charles, in profile.

    "body": "More than 30 killed in blast at Pakistan mosque, officials say12 hours agoShahzad Malik and Umer Draz, BBC Urdu, and Flora DruryIslamabad and LondonPakistan mosque explosion: where the attack unfoldedAt least 32 people have been killed and more than 160 injured in an explosion at a mosque during Friday prayers in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, officials say.A suicide bomber detonated a device after approaching the Shia mosque in the Tarlai area of the city, police said.The Islamic State (IS) group claimed the attack, in a statement posted on its Telegram channel seen by the BBC. The group also issued a picture of the alleged bomber.Condemning the attack, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed \"deep grief\". The country's president, Asif Ali Zardari, said \"targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity\".Before the claim by IS, Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif suggested India and Afghanistan had been behind the attack.Asif said in a social media post that it had been \"proven\" the attacker had travelled to and from Afghanistan, and \"collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed\".Afghanistan's Taliban government described Asif's comments as \"regrettable\", saying the Pakistani minister \"hastily attempted to attribute the incident to Afghanistan without presenting any credible evidence\".Afghan foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi earlier called such attacks a \"contradiction to Islamic and humanitarian values\".The Indian foreign ministry also condemned the bombing, calling the accusations it may be involved \"baseless\".A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he condemned the attack in the \"strongest terms\" and called for those responsible to be \"identified and brought to justice\". 'We bowed - then there was an explosion'EPAEmergency vehicles and private cars transported the injured to hospitalZaheer Abbas was inside the Khadijatul Kubra Mosque praying when he first heard the sound of bullets.\"After that, we bowed and then prostrated, and then there was an explosion,\" he told BBC Urdu. \"After which there were injured people lying everywhere.\"Pictures from the mosque in the aftermath show footwear scattered across the floor, shattered glass, and people sat among the wreckage.AFP via Getty ImagesAlmost 170 were injured in the explosion, with an appeal for blood donors being issuedAbbas, who said he \"lost his senses\" in the moments after the explosion, was eventually pulled out by emergency services and taken to hospital, where he was quickly released.\"Fortunately, I did not suffer much injury,\" he said.According to Pakistan's defence minister, the attacker opened fire and detonated the bomb after being challenged by security guards.The mosque's caretaker Syed Ashfaq - who lives next door - also heard gunfire, and began running towards the mosque to help.\"By the time I reached it there had already been an explosion,\" he told the BBC. \"Bodies were lying everywhere, some were missing arms, some missing legs. We took the most injured in our own vehicle [to hospital].\"Islamabad's deputy commissioner Irfan Memon said on X that the death toll stood at 31, with the injured numbering 169.Pictures from local hospitals show the injured being brought by private vehicles and ambulances, with one photographer for news agency AFP saying they saw dozens of people arriving at hospital.Attacks are relatively rare in the capital, although one in November left 12 dead. Another 27 were injured in the blast, outside a courthouse.The blast on Friday comes after a week of violence which saw 58 civilians killed in coordinated attacks in the province of Balochistan. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group said it was behind the attacks. The military - which has been fighting an insurgency in the region for decades - said it had killed more than 200 militants in response.Last year was also Pakistan's deadliest in over a decade as combat-related deaths surged 74%, with militants accounting for more than half the death toll, according to a new report released by an independent think tank.The Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) said violence in Pakistan left 3,413 people dead - up from 1,950 in 2024 - with 2,138 militants killed.IS claimed the attack in the name of its \"Pakistan Province\" branch on Friday, via the group's Telegram channels. IS's Amaq \"news agency\" issued a statement offering additional details.Amaq alleged that the IS attacker arrived at the \"central temple [mosque]\" in Tarlai district in the Shahzad area. Guards at the location then tried to halt the attacker at the external gate, it claimed, but he fired his pistol at them, injuring two, before heading inside.IS  said the alleged attacker was named \"Sayf Allah al-Ansari\". The nom de guerre Ansari is often used to indicate somebody who is a local to the area. Amaq's report also shared a photo showing what it said was the alleged masked attacker.

    "body": "19 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondentAlamyThe two men, aged 27 and 29, had rented a property in Camblanes-et-Meynac, home to about 3,000 peopleTwo suspected Chinese spies, accused of using a sleepy village in south-western France to gather information, have been arrested.Residents of Camblanes-et-Meynac, about 15km (9 miles) from Bordeaux, grew suspicious when - after letting a house through rentals giant Airbnb - the Chinese pair erected a large parabolic antenna in the garden.The dish was directed at the sky and locals noticed that its installation coincided with a spate of cuts to their own internet service.Intelligence experts believe south-western France is being increasingly targeted by Chinese and other espionage because of the region's proximity to defence, aerospace and telecommunication sites.Last Saturday, officers from France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) agency raided the house and seized a large quantity of computer equipment.The men - Chinese nationals aged 27 and 29 - were questioned at DGSI headquarters in the suburbs of France's capital Paris, and have now been charged with \"delivering information to a foreign power... likely to damage the interests [of France]\". They are being held in custody.The prosecutor's office said the men had arrived in France last month under work visas which said they were engineers at a company specialising in wireless communications.Two other men of Chinese origin, but living in France, have been charged with providing assistance. According to the prosecutor's office, the suspected spies were trying to \"capture satellite data from [X owner Elon Musk's] Starlink network, as well as data from vital entities, notably military, in order to retransmit them to their country of origin, China\".It is not the first time suspected Chinese spies have been caught in south-western France.Last summer, a 51-year-old Chinese engineer was detained in the village of Boulogne-sur-Gesse, about 40 miles south-west of Toulouse. She had also installed a satellite dish and was suspected of trying to intercept signals from the Issus-Aussaguel ground station in the Toulouse suburbs.Meanwhile, in December, a mathematics researcher at the University of Bordeaux's Institute of Mechanics and Engineering was placed under judicial investigation for \"providing information to a foreign power\" after he allegedly allowed members of a Chinese delegation into a restricted area.\"We do not know precisely what the pair at Camblanes-et-Meynac were up to, but the list of potential targets in the south-west of France is very large,\" said Jeremy André, an expert in Asian espionage at Intelligence Online.In addition to Issus-Aussaguel - which communicates with satellites used by the French military and intelligence - there is a major airbase at Bordeaux-Mérignac. Defence industries like Airbus, Thales and Dassault all have installations in the area.\"Since World War One, the south-west has been a vital zone for French defence research,\" André said. \"The idea was to focus activity as far as possible from the frontline, and then it stayed.\"He continued: \"We know that the Chinese have spent a lot of energy developing co-operation with towns and other collectivities in the south-west, via legitimate diplomatic and economic channels.\"In itself, there's nothing wrong with that, but in doing so they create a tissue of links which can be activated on demand.\"According to intelligence experts, French authorities have recently decided to take cases like this to court. Previously, they would have chosen to deal with them covertly, suggesting a greater determination to publicise the espionage threat from China.In Camblanes-et-Meynac, locals were bemused by the story. \"Here we tend to get artists, not spies,\" said Mayor Jean-Philippe Guillemeot. \"Maybe they just wanted somewhere nice and quiet.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says he 'didn't see' racist clip depicting Obamas as apesUS President Donald Trump has said he \"didn't see\" the part of a social media video which showed a racist clip depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was at the end of a 62-second video he shared containing claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The video was later removed.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said \"I didn't make a mistake\" when asked whether he was going to apologise.He added he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was posted by a staff member and didn't know it contained that depiction of the Obamas. Republican Senator Tim Scott - who is black - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The White House initially defended the clip as an \"internet meme video\" and told critics to \"stop the fake outrage\".But after fierce backlash, including from several Republican senators, the post was removed from Trump's Truth Social account and a White House official said that a staffer had \"erroneously\" made the post.The clip - which recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys - appears to be taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October. That video also depicts several other high-profile Democrats as animals, including New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump's predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden, is also depicted as an ape eating a banana. The Obamas have yet to comment on the video. The video was one of dozens posted to Trump's Truth Social account overnight.\"I look at a lot of thousands of things,\" the president said while aboard Air Force One on Friday, adding that after watching only part of the video he \"gave it to the people who generally, they look at the whole thing\".He says he liked the video's message on voter fraud, but that if his staff had looked at the whole thing, \"probably they would have had the sense to take it down\".\"We took it down as soon as we found out about it,\" he added. ReutersSome criticism came from within Trump's own party. Senator Scott, a South Carolina Republican and an ally of Trump, posted that he was \"praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".\"The President should remove it,\" he added. Another Republican, New York representative Mike Lawler, called the post \"wrong and incredibly offensive - whether intentional or a mistake\" and said it \"should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.\" The criticism continued even after the post was taken down. John Curtis, a Republican Senator from Utah, posted on social media that the video was \"blatantly racist and inexcusable\". \"It should never have been posted or left published for so long,\" he wrote. According to CBS, the BBC's US partner, Florida representative Byron Donalds - a longtime supporter of Trump's who is running for governor - called the White House after the video was posted and was told that it was the work of a staffer who \"let the president down\". The BBC has contacted the White House for clarification on how many people have access to the president's account and what the approval process is for posts. In a statement sent to the BBC earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the clip is from \"an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King\". \"Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,\" she added. Before it was removed, Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, called the video \"disgusting and utterly despicable\" and accused Trump of attempting to distract the public from the Epstein case and a \"rapidly failing economy.\" Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications in the Obama White House, said: \"Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our country.\" In a short post of his own, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said that \"Donald Trump is a racist\". \"Disgusting behaviour by the president,\" the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X. \"Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - who himself accused Trump of racism last year after he shared an AI-image depicting Jeffries with a moustache and sombrero - responded to the recent video by calling Trump a \"vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder\". \"Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry,\" he added. The clip of the Obamas was added to the end of a minute-long video which included claims about a voting conspiracy in Michigan in the 2020 presidential election. Those claims were debunked as part of Dominion Voting System's successful civil legal actions against some media companies.Trump also has a long history of criticising and attacking Obama.Before his first term as president, Trump regularly made false claims that the Hawaii-born Obama was actually born in Kenya and therefore was ineligible to be president.He later acknowledged that Obama was born in the US.",

Some Zambians mockingly called it a \"blouse\".But Zambia's leader hit back by sharing his love for the design, saying he would be \"ordering more of that stuff\" for himself, in a video posted on X from the Ghana–Zambia Business Forum held in Lusaka this week.Ghana's foreign minister said the social media buzz was a sign that young people were keen to reclaim their cultural roots.In Ghana itself, a move to encourage traditional outfits has led to \"Fugu Friday\", which sees people wear African clothing.Following days of online back and forth between netizens of the two countries, President Hakainde Hichilema expressed his admiration for the Ghanaian outfit.\"We'll be ordering more fugu from Ghana following the social media conversations,\" Hichilema said on Friday in Zambia's capital, Lusaka.When Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama arrived for a three-day State Visit on Wednesday, he was proudly sporting a fugu - a traditional northern Ghanaian outfit made from hand‑woven, narrow strips of thick cotton fabric stitched together to form a structured, poncho‑style garment.In contrast, his Zambian counterparts was wearing a suit and tie to welcome him at the airport.This elicited a strong reaction from some Zambians online, for example there were dozens of mocking comments on the Zambian Scorpion Facebook group. Malama Mulenga referred to the fugu as a ''maternity blouse'', Mwangala Imbula posted: ''Am coming to get that blouse'', while Master G wrote  ''We love our blouse brothers''.Ghanaian officials attending the forum responded by highlighting the deep cultural significance of the fugu.Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa described it as not just an item of clothing but a symbol of African identity, dignity, and heritage.\"For the young ones on social media who want to know more about the attire… this is the attire that the founder of Ghana, Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah, wore when he declared independence on the 6th of March 1957 in Ghana,\" he said.A popular Ghanaian YouTuber also threw his hat into the debate. He added that ''it is unfortunate that many of you, despite having access to smartphones and the internet, still choose to remain ignorant''.More about Ghana from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "37 minutes agoKathryn ArmstrongAFP via Getty ImagesKyiv residents have been sleeping in metro stations to avoid Russian air strikesUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, adding that both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week.\"America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams – Ukraine and Russia – meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,\" he said.There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow, but US President Donald Trump has been pushing for an end for the conflict since he took office again more than a year ago. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure - causing further widespread blackouts during freezing conditions.In comments released on Saturday, Zelensky told reporters about what had taken place during the second round of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi, which ended on Friday with no reports of a breakthrough. Zelensky said \"difficult issues remained difficult\", including territorial concessions that Ukraine is under pressure to make.He said the parties discussed, for the first time, the possibility of a trilateral meeting between leaders, not simply representatives, but cautioned that \"preparatory elements are needed for this\". Asked whether a time frame had been given for an agreement, the Ukrainian leader replied: \"The Americans say that they want to do everything by June. \"Why before this summer?\" he added. \"We understand that their domestic issues in the US will have an impact.\" Zelensky did not elaborate on what these issues are.As the diplomacy continues, so too are Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities. \"Russian criminals carried out another massive attack on Ukraine's energy facilities,\" Ukraine's energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on Telegram. Substations, which control the flow of electricity, and overhead power lines that \"form the backbone of Ukraine's power grid\" were targeted, Shmyhal said. Power plants were also struck.Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said \"the power deficit in the power system of Ukraine significantly increased\" as a result of the latest attacks. Shmyhal said neighbouring Poland had been asked for emergency power supplies.Zelensky wrote on social media that Friday night's attack involved more than 400 drones and 40 missiles. Air-defence systems intercepted most, but not all, of them, the Ukrainian military said.\"The main targets were the energy grid, generation facilities, and distribution substations,\" he said, adding that damage had been reported in at least four regions.In the western region of Lviv, the Dobrotvir power plant came under attack, leaving thousands of people without electricity, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi. At least 6,000 people were without power as a result of hourly power outage schedules, he added.The Burshtyn power plant was also struck in the nearby Ivano-Frankivsk region.  DTEK, which runs both the Dobrotvir and Burshtyn plants said that it was the 10th \"massive attack\" on its power plants since October 2025.\"In total, DTEK thermal power plants have been attacked by the enemy more than 220 times since the beginning of the full-scale invasion,\" the company added on Telegram. This was launched by Russia nearly four years ago. One person was reported dead in the Rivne regions and several were injured in the Zaporizhzhia. Rivne's head, Oleksandr Koval, said there was also damage to homes and \"critical infrastructure\".In Kyiv, residents once again took shelter in metro stations. Among them, Oksana Kykhtenko, told the Reuters news agency: \"They [Russians] make us live in inhumane conditions. Without heating, without electricity.\" A drone strike in the city of Yahotyn, about 10km (62 miles) away, caused a fire at a warehouse complex, the Ukrainian emergency services said. Ukraine has also attacked Russia, striking a factory that makes missile fuel components in the western Tver region, according to media reports quoting Ukrainian security officials. Russia has not commented about any of the latest attacks.  State Emergency Service of UkraineA fire broke out at a warehouse in the city of Yahotyn as a result of a Russian drone strikeMoscow renewed its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Monday after a week-long pause that US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe due to the fierce cold in Ukraine.DTEK said the combined missile and drone strikes caused \"the most powerful blow\" to infrastructure so far this year. \"Moscow must be deprived of the ability to use the cold as leverage against Ukraine,\" Zelensky wrote on X on Saturday, responding to the latest strikes.It is not yet known who was behind the shooting.Some 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zelensky said earlier this week. The BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine.",

    "body": "20 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorWatch: BBC on the scene of Russian general shooting in MoscowA high-profile general in Russia's military has been shot several times and wounded in Moscow.Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of the capital, and is believed to be in a serious condition. The attacker fled the scene.Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence  and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.No-one has so far claimed the attack, but senior Russian officials immediately blamed Ukraine, saying it was trying to derail negotiations to end the war.\"The victim has been taken to one of the city's hospitals,\" said Svetlana Petrenko of Russia's Investigations Committee (SK), which said it opened a criminal case for attempted murder.Investigators are searching CCTV footage for clues and began interviewing potential witnesses of the attack on Friday morning on Volokolamsk Highway.Russian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligenceA neighbour of Alexeyev told the Reuters news agency she had been woken by the sound of \"several\" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.  \"This is all I heard. Other neighbours rushed out, too. They asked how they could help, should they call ambulance and police, but she had already called them.\"Alexeyev has played a significant role during the war in Ukraine, taking part in talks with Ukraine during the Russian siege of the city of Mariupol in 2022. Earlier he was awarded the title Hero of Russia for the role he played in Moscow's military intervention in Syria's civil war.He was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.He was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.His boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team at peace talks with Ukrainian and US teams in Abu Dhabi. The latest round ended on Thursday without a major breakthrough.It is not yet known who was behind the shooting - but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to accuse Ukraine.He said \"this terrorist act\" was aimed at \"disrupting the negotiation process\".Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin was being briefed on the shooting. \"We wish first of all that the general survives and recovers. We hope that will be the case,\" Peskov told reporters.Ukraine has not commented but has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past. Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time it was behind the attack.Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection troops.In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to Russia's SK.",

    "body": "9 hours agoRegan Morris,in Tucson, ArizonaandMax MatzaWatch: What we still don’t know about the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s motherPolice are investigating a new message sent to a local TV news station that might be linked to the suspected abduction of the mother of US news presenter Savannah Guthrie.Authorities on Friday said they were \"aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie\". They are \"inspecting the information provided in the message for its accuracy\".The new development comes amid public pleas from the Guthrie family for proof that their mother is still alive and after the first deadline in one of the alleged ransom letters passed on Thursday evening.The 84-year-old is believed to have been taken from her home in Tucson, Arizona, last weekend. Police are offering a reward of $50,000 (£36,000) for information.Watch: What's happened since Savannah Guthrie's mother disappeared?The statement from the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff's Department did not specify who received the note, or any details that it may have contained. A presenter for a local affiliate of CBS News told the BBC that her channel received the \"message\". It is unclear if it was sent to other media outlets. On Thursday, Camron Guthrie - the son of the missing woman - renewed the family's plea, and confirmed that the family had not had any direct contact with kidnappers.\"We have to know that you have our mum,\" Camron said in the family's latest video message. \"We want to talk to you.\"\"We haven't heard anything directly,\" he said in the video, posted on Thursday just after 17:00 local time in Arizona (00:00 GMT).\"We need you to reach out, and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward.\"The case has mystified the country and even US President Donald Trump has weighed in, ordering federal authorities to help investigate. On Friday, Trump said authorities had uncovered \"some clues\" and added that \"we could have some answers\" soon in the case. There has been a large police and media presence outside the Guthrie home for daysThe new message is one of several that authorities say they are investigating.At a briefing on Thursday, FBI Special Agent Heith Janke said his agency was reviewing one of the notes, which he called a possible ransom note. It gave a deadline for payment of 17:00 on Thursday, he said, without specifying which time zone, and had a second deadline for Monday.No further information was shared about what was threatened if the deadline was not met. \"We're not going to go into specifics,\" Janke said.It was announced the same day that authorities had made an arrest over a fake ransom note. Earlier in the week, Savannah Guthrie shared an emotional video message, along with her siblings. The host of NBC News' Today programme addressed the potential abductor or abductors directly, saying: \"We are ready to talk... We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and you have her... Please, reach out to us\".Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive.\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" he said. \"Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes.\" Neighbours have erected signs for the Guthrie familyDozens of reporters and camera crews have descended on the quiet Arizona suburb where Nancy lives.Authorities have closed access to her street, nestled below the Santa Catalina mountains on roads lined with the state's iconic Saguaro cactus.\"Investigators are conducting follow-up at the Guthrie home and in the surrounding areas,\" police wrote in a post on X, adding that the road is \"restricted to provide investigators space\".One man, when asked how he felt about security, shouted that he had already been interviewed four times today and wasn't doing any more. He then showed us a big stick, saying this is all the security he needs. He added he was not worried about kidnappers but he was worried about javelina, the hoofed mammals found in Tucson.Authorities have urged the public to call the sheriff's office with any information, vowing to look into all leads, and discouraging the spread of misinformation.Correction 7 February 2026: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Savannah Guthrie had been suspected of being abducted. This was later updated to say it was her mother, Nancy Guthrie, who had been suspected of being abducted.",

Dean Nyirenda was returning from a fishing trip with two friends on Wednesday when they bumped into the elephants. They ran away, with Nyirenda diving into a stream near the Luangwa River.\"That is when he was attacked by a crocodile by biting his right thigh,\" local police chief Robertson Mweemba told journalists. The southern African country has a thriving elephant population and clashes between humans and wildlife have claimed many lives in recent years.Police said Nyirenda had managed to escape the crocodile by hitting it with a stick which he had in his hands.\"He dragged himself from the stream,\" said MweembaHis two fellow fishermen, who had been watching from a distance, went to help him and carried him from the riverbank while he was bleeding heavily, state-run ZNBC news website reported.  \"They tried to stop the bleeding but unfortunately he died,\" added the police chief. Wildlife officers later visited the scene and found deep bite marks on the fisherman's right thigh, which had led to the fatal bleeding.The BBC has reached out to the authorities for comment.The Luangwa River, which flows through Zambia's South Luangwa National Park, is home to one of the highest concentrations of Nile crocodiles in Africa, according to conservationists. Of the 26 wildlife-related deaths recorded in 2023, 15 were caused by crocodile attacks, most of them along the Luangwa River, according to Resource Africa, a community-led conservation NGO.Zambian authorities have previously called on locals and tourists to exercise extreme caution when travelling through the country's wildlife hotspots.Wildlife authorities say they have been considering measures to reduce the human-animal conflicts, including building protective fences near wildlife areas.You may also be interested in: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "4 hours agoTabby WilsonBBC NewsEPAUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order threatening to impose additional tariffs on countries that continue to trade with Iran. The order, issued on Friday, does not specify the rate that could be imposed, but uses 25% as an example. It says the tariff could apply to goods imported into the US from any nation that \"directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires any goods or services from Iran\".Trump has not directly commented on the order but reiterated \"no nuclear weapons\" for Iran when speaking from Air Force One on Friday night.It comes as talks continue between senior US and Iranian officials in Oman, following several weeks of threats from both sides. Trump threatened a 25% tariff of countries doing business with Iran earlier this year, in a post to Truth Social. On 12 January, he wrote: \"Effective immediately, any country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America.\"At the time, no further detail was provided on how the tariffs would work in practice.The White House said that this latest executive order reaffirmed the \"ongoing national emergency with respect to Iran\" and noted that the president may modify it of circumstances change. It read: \"The President is holding Iran accountable for its pursuit of nuclear capabilities, support for terrorism, ballistic missile development, and regional destabilisation that endanger American security, allies, and interests.\" Separately, the US state department announced on Friday that it was sanctioning 15 entities \"that have traded in Iranian-origin crude oil, petroleum products, or petrochemical products\". There was no immediate comment to either announcement from Iran, which is already subject to extensive sanctions imposed by the US and other Western powers over the country's nuclear programme.Tehran insists this is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Under a 2015 nuclear deal with world leaders, Iran was not permitted to enrich uranium above 3.67% purity - the level required for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants - and was not allowed to carry out any enrichment at its Fordo plant for 15 years.However, Trump abandoned the agreement during his first term in 2018, saying it did too little to stop a pathway to a bomb, and reinstated US sanctions, which crippled the Iranian economy. Those measures - affecting oil exports, shipping and banks - included \"secondary sanctions\" on countries trading with Iran.Tehran retaliated by increasingly breaching restrictions under the deal, particularly those related to the production of enriched uranium.EPA/ShutterstockIran's economy is in deep trouble, with food inflation alone exceeding 70%Despite sanctions on certain products and industries, there are still more than 100 countries that trade with Iran.Its biggest export partner is China. In the year to October 2025, Beijing bought more than $14bn (£10.4bn) of products from Iran, according to figures from Trade Data Monitor based on official Iranian data. China is followed by Iraq, which received $10.5bn worth of goods from its neighbour. Iran also counts the United Arab Emirates and Turkey among its largest customers. Exports from Iran to Turkey jumped substantially from $4.7bn in 2024 to $7.3bn last year.Starting in Oman on Friday, the ongoing talks are the first involving US and Iranian officials since last June, when the US bombed Iran's three main nuclear facilities.The Iranian delegation was led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, while the US was represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One, Trump said Friday's talks were \"very good\", and that Iran \"looks like it wants to make a deal very badly\". \"If they don't make a deal, the consequences are very steep,\" the president said, adding that there will be another meeting early next week. Oman's Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the discussions, said they had been \"useful to clarify both Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress\".The president has said he would be prepared to strike the Middle Eastern nation if it refused to reach a deal on its nuclear programme. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.The US has also built up a significant military presence in the region, including what Trump describes as a \"massive armada\" in response to Iran's violent repression of nationwide anti-government protests last month. Human rights groups have said that many thousands of people were killed in the crackdown, but the full scale of the bloodshed remains unclear due to internet restrictions imposed by the government since 8 January.",

    "body": "Nearly a week since the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US news presenter Savannah Guthrie, police are investigating a new message sent to a local news station. It comes after the first deadline from an alleged ransom letter passed on Thursday evening. Guthrie's family continues to plea for proof that their mother, who is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona, is still alive. The BBC's Regan Morris is in Tucson and details the status of the investigation, and the questions that remain.",

    "body": "The retired Indian factory worker who built a library of two million books12 hours agoImran QureshiMandya district, KarnatakaAlphonse VimulrajAnke Gowda was passionate about books since he was a child and wanted to inspire others to read tooTwo million books, housed across a sprawling building, free for anyone to borrow and read.That's the wealth that Anke Gowda, a retired sugar factory worker from India's southern Karnataka state, has accumulated over the past five decades.The 79-year-old made headlines last month when he received the Padma Shri - a civilian honour awarded by the federal government - for his extraordinary contribution to promoting literacy and learning.Gowda - whose eye-popping collection includes rare editions of the Bible, along with books on every subject imaginable - comes from a farming family where books were a luxury.\"I grew up in a village. We never got books to read, but I was always curious about them. I kept thinking that I should read, gather books and gain knowledge,\" he told the BBC.Gowda's library is located in Pandavapura, a small municipality in Karnataka's Mandya district. It lacks the rigid organisation usually associated with libraries. In fact, Gowda's collection doesn't have a librarian and books are stacked on shelves and piled on the floor in a haphazard manner.Outside, under the library's awnings are sacks filled with an estimated 800,000 books, still waiting to be unpacked. The collection is still growing, through Gowda's purchases and donations from others.The place is frequented by students, their parents, teachers and book lovers. Regular visitors seem to know their way around the library and find the books they need with ease. And even if they can't, they say, Gowda can find anything.Gowda, his wife and son live in a corner of the library, which is open every day of the week - and for long hours.Alphonse VimulrajGowda's library has books on a vast array of subjects...Alphonse Vimulraj...and finding a book can be quite a challengeGowda spent his childhood juggling school and helping his father with farm work. He would often ask his parents and elder sister for money to buy books.  When he began reading books about Indian freedom fighters and spiritual leaders, he got hooked.\"They were like candy,\" he says.Inspired by a teacher, he started building a small collection of books so that other students from rural areas could also read.He often used the money his parents gave him for food to buy books instead.Soon after finishing school, he started working as a bus conductor.One day, about 10 months into the job, he bumped into a former teacher who was shocked to hear that he had quit studying. He insisted that Gowda resign and go to college. Gowda followed his advice and went on to get a postgraduate degree in Kannada (the official language of Karnataka), before joining the Pandavapura sugar factory as a timekeeper.He would spend two-thirds of his monthly salary on books, and use the remaining money for groceries and other necessities.\"Salaries were low then, but prices were also low,\" he says.Over the 33 years he worked at the factory, Gowda attended dozens of conferences of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat - a non-profit dedicated to developing the local language and literature - and would often buy discounted books from them.He also augmented his income by raising cows and selling milk, and working as an insurance agent.His next hurdle would be familiar to book lovers everywhere - finding space to house his overflowing collection.\"I started keeping the books in trunks [large metal boxes]. Then I installed bookshelves in my house. But at one point, there was no place left,\" he says.At the time, he had acquired around 50,000 books.Alphonse VimulrajGowda's collection includes rare editions of the BibleHelp came when some of his friends met Hari Khoday, the late liquor baron who was building a temple in Pandavapura.Khoday, recalls Gowda, couldn't believe that one man could own so many books.\"He came and saw the books for himself. Then he asked me what I needed. I told him I didn't want any money for myself. My only request was that he build a library,\" Gowda says.Khoday agreed and paid for the construction of a huge building, which is now part of Gowda's sprawling library which stretches across 15,800 sq ft (1,467 sq m).Some years later, a local lawmaker brought then Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy to see the library and he authorised money for the construction of two more structures attached to the first one.Today, students and teachers from across the state visit the library. Among them is Ravi Bettaswami, an assistant professor at a private college who says that he has also been inspired to build a collection of thousands of books.\"I have used Gowda's library to study and have taken my students there so they could read and also help organise the books,\" he says.Shilpashree Haranu, who teaches at a government college, says that the collection may look messy as it has not been organised by a professional librarian. \"But he [Gowda] knows exactly where each book is and can tell you in an instant,\" she says.When asked why he never hired a librarian, Gowda says no-one ever suggested that to him.As for the future of the library, Gowda strikes a philosophical note, suggesting that it is now up to others to take his legacy forward.\"I have fulfilled my responsibility. But I don't have the energy anymore. Maybe the government and the public can take over now? \"I have done my best, now it is up to others.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesStock image of a residential street in Suriname's capital, ParamariboNine people including five children have been stabbed to death on the outskirts of Suriname's capital, Paramaribo, police have said.Another adult and child were taken to hospital after sustaining serious injuries in the attack, city police said in a statement.Officers were called to an address on a road leading out of the capital on Saturday night, where they detained a male suspect after shooting him in the leg. He was also taken to hospital for treatment and is under police guard.Local media has suggested the man was suffering from mental health issues, citing officials and residents, while the South American nation's president said his family and neighbours were among the victims.\"At a time when family and friends should be holding on to and supporting each other, we are confronted with the harsh reality that there is another side to the world,\" Jennifer Geerlings-Simons said in a statement.\"I wish all the bereaved much strength, courage and comfort during this unimaginably difficult time.\"Police said further details about the circumstances of the incident would follow. Suriname is among nations with the lowest rates of stabbing deaths, making incidents such as this one relatively rare.However, it has endured several coups and a civil war since gaining its independence from the Netherlands in 1975.",

    "body": "The Albanian nationalist Vetevendosje party has won a landslide victory in Kosovo's parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results. With 90% of the votes counted, the party, whose name means \"self determination\", was on 50.8%, meaning a third term in power for its leader, Albin Kurti. The two main opposition parties, the centre-right Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), were on 20.98% and 13.89%, respectively.Vetevendosje won elections in February, but without a majority, and Kosovo has been without a functioning government since then. The impasse meant there was one big question hanging over this second parliamentary election of the year. Would voters punish Kurti for the long months of deadlock in the country's National Assembly – or the opposition parties who refused to countenance a coalition with Kurti's left-wing movement?The electorate has given a clear answer. This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.It is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.Kurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.Arben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.There is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.Repairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.The EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.The fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.One analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power. But he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".",

    "body": "Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has received a medical procedure to treat his chronic hiccups, his medical team has said.Saturday's treatment \"went well\", according to one of his doctors. Another, Claudio Birolini, added that the procedure - which he stressed was not a surgery - lasted for \"about an hour\".The far-right former leader is currently serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the Latin American nation's 2022 presidential election to left-wing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.This latest procedure comes after the 70-year-old successfully underwent surgery for a double hernia earlier this week, after being granted permission to be transferred to hospital.Ahead of the surgery, Bolsonaro also endorsed his son Flávio to run against Lula in Brazil's 2026 presidential election. His statement - a handwritten letter - was read out by the younger Bolsonaro outside the hospital.Following the successful surgery, his medical team deemed it necessary to treat his recurrent hiccups, which he had been suffering from for months.\"It's been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups,\" Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, said on Saturday.She explained in a social media post that her husband's procedure had \"blocked\" one of his phrenic nerves.The phrenic nerves contract and expand the diaphragm, which allows the lungs to inhale and exhale. Hiccups are caused by the involuntary spasming of the diaphragm, typically as a result of an irritated phrenic nerve.His doctors later confirmed they had treated the right phrenic nerve and had scheduled to work on the left nerve on Monday.Once discharged from hospital, the former president will return to a cell in the federal police headquarters to continue serving his sentence. Bolsonaro was found guilty of the coup plot in September. He was placed under house arrest pending appeals, but was taken into police custody last month after being deemed a \"concrete flight risk\".Court officials said he had attempted to break his ankle monitor and planned to use a rally outside his house as cover for an escape attempt. Bolsonaro insisted he had no intention of fleeing.Also on Saturday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest of 10 officials for participating in his coup attempt. All of them had served in his government.",

    "body": "A cruise ship has run aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on its first trip since the death of an elderly passenger in late October. The Coral Adventurer is currently under investigation over the death of Suzanne Rees, 80, who died on a remote Australian island after being left behind by the ship. On Saturday, the vessel suffered a \"grounding incident\" off the eastern coast of PNG, around 30km (18 miles) from the city of Lae, a spokesperson for the ship said. All passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship have been reported safe, and initial inspections have not revealed any damage to the hull. Further inspections will take place on Sunday. A spokesperson for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) told the BBC in a statement that it had not received a distress call from the Coral Adventurer.It added it was monitoring the situation and would support PNG authorities if necessary. No decisions have been made about the current 12-day voyage, which was due to finish on 30 December.There were 80 passengers and 43 crew members aboard the ship at the time of the incident.The Coral Adventurer is currently the subject of a joint investigation by Amsa and Queensland Police, Ms Rees was found dead on Lizard Island on 26 October.She had been hiking on the island with fellow passengers, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The ship was just two days into a 60-day voyage at the time of Ms Rees's death. The remainder of the cruise was cancelled with full refunds offered to all passengers.  The CEO of Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.Mr Fifield added that the cruise operator was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Amsa was not able to comment on the status of the investigation, and told the BBC that it was \"not in the practice of making the results of its investigations public\".

    "body": "12 hours agoThomas MackintoshGetty ImagesThe Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute issued alerts for strong winds across large parts of northern Sweden as Storm Johannes hitA third person has died in Sweden after a powerful winter storm swept across Nordic countries, causing travel disruption and power outages.Sweden's meteorological agency issued alerts for strong winds for large parts of the northern half of the country as Storm Johannes hit.One man in his 50s died after being struck by a tree at the Kungsberget ski resort in the country's south, local media and police reported. Further north, regional utility company Hemab said one of its employees died in an accident while out working.Police also said a man in his 60s was taken to hospital after being hit by a tree while working in a forest in Hofors, east-central Sweden, and later died of his injuries.Tens of thousands of homes in Sweden, Norway and Finland have been left without power as a result of the storm.In Sweden, more than 40,000 homes were affected by power outages and numerous rail services were cancelled, Swedish news agency TT reported.Several flights, rail and ferry services across parts of the Nordic nations have been cancelled. Roads and rail services have also been disrupted due to the storm conditions.In Norway's Nordland region, one of the most northerly counties in the country, the fire department responded to more than 200 weather‑related incidents, broadcaster NRK reported.Storm Johannes cut power to around 23,000 homes in Nordland and a further 9,000 were without electricity in the Inland region, according to NRK.In Finland, the storm - known there as Hannes - subsided on Sunday morning but had left more than 60,000 homes without power, according to public broadcaster Yle.Flights at Kittila airport in northern Finland were grounded after heavy winds pushed a passenger jet and a smaller plane off the runway and into a bank of snow, the Helsinki Times reported.The Swiss Air jet, carrying about 150 passengers, had just landed from Geneva and was taxiing when it veered off, the paper said. The smaller jet, a 400XT model, was on the ground at the same time and was also pushed off course by the wind, it added.There have been no reported injuries.",

    "body": "Italian police have arrested nine people accused of raising around €7m (£6m) for Hamas over more than two years.The money was ostensibly collected as humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians, a police statement said, but was instead sent to the militant group via a \"complex fundraising system\".Alongside the arrests, police say they have seized more than €8m (£7m) in assets as part of the investigation. Police say the suspects are \"specifically accused of carrying out financing operations believed to have contributed to terrorist activities\".The arrests were made as part of a joint initiative between Italy's counter-terror police and financial police.The investigation began after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack in southern Israel. Police say they analysed \"a series of reports of suspicious financial transactions\" involving some of the suspects in the lead up to the attack.Investigators uncovered a \"complex\" system of fundraising, which was headquartered in Genoa with branches in Milan, the statement adds.\"The suspects collected donations intended for the civilian population of Gaza, however, it emerged that over 71% of these funds were diverted to Hamas's coffers to finance its military wing and support the families of suicide bombers or those detained for terrorism,\" the police statement says.Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the most well-known of the arrested suspects was Mohammad Hannoun, the president of the Palestinian Association in Italy.Piantedosi thanked police for their work in a post on X, but also noted that \"the presumption of innocence... must always be recognised at this stage\".Mr Hannoun said that he is \"neither closely nor remotely\" related to Hamas but has always supported them. \"I have always declared with utmost transparency that I am a Palestinian citizen and publicly support the legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people,\" he told reporters.",

    "body": "13 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystWidespread tributes have been shared for Bahram Beyzai, a giant of Iranian cinema and theatre, who has died aged 87 in the US.The front pages of Iranian newspapers mourn his loss, with opposition voices and those who look back fondly on the Shah era also paying homage to Beyzai.Prince Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last Shah of Iran, described his passing as \"a great loss for the the art and culture of our country\".Although Beyzai's later films were banned in the 1980s by the Islamic regime that toppled the Shah, a number of senior figures in the current government have also paid tribute to his contribution to Iranian culture.Several of the current crop of Iranian filmmakers have acknowledged their debt to him, with Jaafar Panahi - whose latest film won the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival - saying that he taught them \"how to stand up to oblivion\".Beyzai avoided direct political references in his work, both as a playwright and a film director, and always said he tried not to trade in overt messages.But his work over many decades sets historical, even mythic figures in conflict with oppressive religious and political systems.From a family of celebrated poets, Beyzai was imbued in the deepest traditions of Persian culture from birth.He first found fame as a playwright, drawing on Persian legend and ritual.A lifelong fan of cinema, he moved into making films in the 1970s.He won renown as one of the key figures in the new wave of Iranian cinema.His most productive period straddled the era of the Shah and then the Islamic theocratic forces that deposed him - with both systems ever ready to sniff out hidden messages that could be interpreted as dissent.As Jaafar Panahi has put it in his tribute: \"Beyzai did not choose the easy way. He endured years of exclusion, imposed silence, and distance, but he did not give up his language and his beliefs.\"A few years after the Iranian Revolution, he produced what many regard as his masterpiece, Bashu, the Little Stranger, about a small boy who tries to take refuge from the Iran-Iraq war. It was banned in Iran - as were other films he made in that period - but later voted by film critics as the greatest Iranian film of all time.The film was shown in a restored version at this year's Venice Film Festival, winning an award for best film in the classics section.Beyzai finally left Iran in 2010, and spent his later years in the US where he taught Iranian culture.Although he left his homeland, his wife, the actress Mozhdeh Shamsai, said just hearing the word Iran would still bring tears to his eyes - and he remained ever hopeful of a new culture and future for his homeland.",

    "body": "1 day agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterThe head of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC has demanded $1m (£740,000) in damages from a musician who cancelled a concert after US President Donald Trump's name was added to the venue.Chuck Redd called off his Christmas Eve performance, which he has hosted annually since 2006, citing a vote by the board to rename the site the Trump Kennedy Center.The centre's president Richard Grenell wrote in a letter that the cancellation was a \"political stunt\" and \"has cost us considerably\". Redd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired several of the board members and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board.Grenell wrote in his letter to Redd that his no-show was \"classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution\".He added: \"Your dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support, combined with your last-minute cancellation has cost us considerably. \"This is your official notice that we will seek $1m in damages from you for this political stunt.\"Last week, the White House announced the centre's board had voted unanimously to rename the cultural institution as The Donald J Trump and John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.A day later, crews could be seen etching the president's name onto the building's façade. Its website and some social media accounts were also renamed.The White House said the renaming effort was in recognition of Trump's actions to renovate the building, but the move was criticised by Democrats, several artists and members of the Kennedy family. \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player, told the Associated Press news agency earlier this week.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesNew sign at the Kennedy CenterCongresswoman Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, recently filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name from the centre.She argued in her lawsuit that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, changing its name should require \"an act of Congress\".The lawsuit says Beatty had phoned into the meeting about the name change, but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. She is one of several lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. Work on a national performing arts centre began in the 1950s, and after Kennedy, the 35th president, was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to turn it into a living memorial to him.",

The five identical sisters, born in Ontario at the height of the Great Depression in 1934, were the first known quintuplets to survive past infancy. They quickly became a global sensation during their childhood - starring in feature films, appearing on the covers of magazines, and endorsing products from toothpaste to syrup. \"Much beloved, Annette had championed children's rights,\" the museum said in a statement announcing her death. Getty ImagesThe Dionne quintuplets on their fourth birthday in 1938The museum, which seeks to preserve their legacy and educate the public on the quintuplets' controversial upbringing, added: \"She believed it was important to maintain the Dionne Quints Museum and the history it provides for the future of all children.\"The quintuplets - Annette, Yvonne, Cécile, Émilie and Marie - were taken away from their parents by the Ontario government when they were infants.For several years, the authorities displayed the children in a compound dubbed \"Quintland\", which became a popular tourist attraction.The children were constantly examined and observed, and had limited contact with their parents and siblings.Their parents later regained custody of the quintuplets. Getty ImagesThe quintuplets on their second birthdayAs adults Annette, Cécile and Yvonne sued the Ontario government for compensation over the circumstances of their childhood, and they received a settlement totalling nearly C$3m (£1.6m; $2.2m) in 1998. Annette was the last surviving sibling out of the 14 Dionne children, the Dionne Quints Home Museum said.Prior to Annette and Cécile's deaths this year, Émilie died in 1954, Marie died in 1970 and Yvonne died in 2001.

    "body": "13 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystThe number of executions in Iran in 2025 is estimated to have more than doubled compared to the number that took place across the country in 2024. Norwegian-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) group told the BBC it had verified at least 1,500 executions up until the start of December, adding that many more have taken place since.Last year, IHR was able to verify 975 executions - although the exact number is never completely clear as Iranian authorities do not give official figures.However, the analysis shows another significant annual rise, and the figures chime with those provided by other monitoring groups.Iran's government has previously defended its use of the death penalty, saying it is limited to only \"the most severe crimes\".Execution figures were already on the rise before mass demonstrations broke out across the country in 2022 following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini.The 22-year-old Kurdish woman was detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab \"improperly\".That protest movement represented the biggest challenge to the legitimacy of Iran's theocratic leadership for many years.In response, authorities intensified the rate of executions from around 520 in 2022 to 832 the following year - according to the figures verified by IHR.There have been some executions for protesters or alleged spies - but 99% of those executed have been for murder or drug offences - a ratio which has remained constant.Activists have said that the rate of executions in Iran increases when the regime feels under threat and that the aim is to forestall internal opposition by instilling fear in the population.It seems to be borne out by the fact that since the 12-day war with Israel in June, as well as major setbacks for Iran's proxy forces across the region, there's been another big surge.",

    "body": "One general, one mathematician: The men competing for power in two African elections2 days agoPaul MellyWest Africa analystAFP via Getty ImagesVoters in Guinea and the Central African Republic will get to vote for president On Sunday, citizens of Guinea and the Central African Republic (CAR) will go to the polls to elect their presidents for terms of office of seven years.Both contests could, in theory, go on to run-off ballots. Yet in both, the incumbents are strong favourites, with observers predicting they will clinch victory outright in the first round with more than 50% of the vote.But that's where the similarities end.The CAR, vast and landlocked, is one of Africa's poorest countries, marred by chronic instability for decades, with a succession of armed groups motivated by a variety of local grievances, opportunities for racketeering or political ambitions.From 2013 to 2016 it was only the intervention of African, French and then UN peacekeepers that averted a slide into deeper inter-communal violence.The national government in Bangui, the riverside capital on the southern border, just across the water from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has often struggled to assert its authority in the distant outer-lying regions of the north or far east.Despite these enduring fragilities, multi-party politics has mostly survived, with a fair degree of tolerance for opposition and protest.There is a sense of national identity and this year has seen two of the most significant rebel groups drawn back into the peace process and starting to disarm and demobilise.The country has a pioneering special court for trying human-rights crimes, staffed with a blend of national and international judges.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Faustin-Archange Touadéra is hoping for a third term in officePresident Faustin-Archange Touadéra is a mathematician and former university vice-chancellor. He entered politics as prime minister under the putschist-turned elected head of state, François Bozizé. Later, after a chaotic interlude of rebel rule and an uncertain transition, he was elected head of state as a post-conflict and consensual civil-society figure.Today, approaching the end of his second term, Touadéra is seen as a far more political and partisan figure. He bulldozed through constitutional reform to scrap term limits, allowing him to stand again. This has provoked a boycott by much, though not all, of the opposition.Yet, contrary to widespread expectations, his most prominent electoral rival, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé, has been allowed to take part in the electoral race.This contrasts with the situation in Guinea, on Africa's west coast, where Gen Mamadi Doumbouya, leader of the September 2021 coup that deposed the 83-year old civilian President Alpha Condé, is now preparing to convert himself into a constitutionally elected ruler.Although Doumbouya will face eight challengers at the ballot box, he has dominated the campaign, with his image plastered all over the streets of Conakry, Guinea's capital city. The most prominent opposition figure of the past 10 years, Cellou Dalein Diallo, with a big personal following among the large Peul community who account for about 40% of the electorate, has been excluded from the contest.Despite these constraints on the political choice presented to voters, the return of an elected government will come as a great relief to the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that promotes economic integration, democracy, and military cooperation among its members.Almost a year ago, it suffered a blow with the withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after the military regimes that had seized power in a wave of coups between 2020 and 2023 refused to comply with the bloc's demands to commit to clear timeframes for the restoration of civilian rule.AFP via Getty ImagesFrom 2021 (L) to today (R) - Mamadi Doumbouya now wants to be a civilian presidentDoumbouya made a different choice.Although he kept good relations with the junta in neighbouring Mali, he has pursued a methodical constitutional review, which has laid the ground for Sunday's vote, even if this has been delayed for longer than Ecowas originally wanted.His approach to international relations also contrasts starkly with neighbouring regimes, who have cultivated close security ties with Russia and repudiated their previous close partnerships with France.Doumbouya has maintained good relations with Western governments, particularly Paris. Officials in Conakry praise the French Development Agency as one of their most supportive partners.Indeed, from the outset, the Doumbouya regime has been treated rather gently by both France and the West generally, and by Ecowas, despite a troubling human rights record.His overthrow of Condé - who had staged a dubious constitutional referendum to allow himself the chance to stand for a third term and had overseen frequent bouts of security force brutality - was celebrated on the streets of Conakry and barely criticised abroad.AFP via Getty ImagesGen Mamadi Doumbouya has dominated the build-up to the electionDoumbouya earned international goodwill when he pressed quickly ahead with the long-delayed trial of those accused of a notorious 2009 stadium massacre when about 150 opposition supporters were killed and many women raped.And even though his own rule saw youth protesters shot, and leading civil society activists Billo Bah and Foniké Mengué detained and never heard from since, regional and international reactions were muted.West Africa has been shaken by coups and the breakaway of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from Ecowas, as well as this month's attempted putsch in Benin. Guinea's decision to stay in the bloc and restore elected government - even if it breaches Doumbouya's earlier promise that no member of his junta would stand in the polls - has been greeted with quiet relief by many regional leaders and European governments, as a step towards reconsolidating normality.With jihadist groups now disrupting daily life and trade across the south of Mali and Burkina Faso, the gradual progress towards constitutional stability in Guinea, despite persistent civil-rights concerns, has been welcomed.The same goes for Touadéra's bid for a third term in the CAR, a country slowly emerging from years of insecurity. The UN peacekeeping force, Minusca, is helping the government to gradually restore basic administration and services, even to distant provincial towns.The CAR still significantly relies on Russian military advice, but the president has taken time to rebuild good relations with France and maintain a close partnership with the EU and the UN.With war-ravaged Sudan just over the north-eastern border, and deep fragilities still persistent at home, international partners are minded to support rather than criticise, despite the frustrations of those opponents who feel that a Touadéra third term would be illegitimate.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "12 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentBrigitte Bardot: From French cinema to international fameFrench actress Brigitte Bardot, who revolutionised 1950s French cinema and became a symbol of sexual liberation, has died aged 91.The cinema icon - \"BB\" as she was known in her home country - acted in almost 50 films, including And God Created Woman, but retired in 1973 to devote her life to animal welfare.French President Emmanuel Macron said the nation was mourning \"a legend of the century\", while the Brigitte Bardot Foundation remembered her as a \"world-renowned actress\".Later in life, Bardot's reputation was damaged after she made homophobic slurs and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred.Thomas Samson via Getty ImagesBrigitte Bardot - pictured here in 2006 - gave up acting to concentrate on animal welfare at the age of 39The Brigitte Bardot Foundation she established said in a statement that it was announcing her death with \"immense sadness\".The animal welfare organisation said she was \"a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation.\" It did not specify where or when Bardot died.Paying tribute, Macron wrote: \"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom.\"French existence, universal brilliance. She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century.\"Meanwhile, French far-right politician Marine Le Pen said France had lost \"an exceptional woman, through her talent, her courage, her frankness, her beauty\".Bardot's husband, whom she married in 1992, was Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the late far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen - the father of Marine.Herbert Dorfman/Corbis via Getty ImagesBardot tore up the rule book of French cinema in the 1950sBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris in 1934 to a wealthy family, who wanted her to become a ballerina.She was discovered in her teens after posing on the cover of Elle magazine, swiftly becoming a sensation in her home country, and was persuaded to enter the cinema world.She played iconic roles, most notably in the 1956 film And God Created Woman, directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim, in which she played a sexually liberated woman. The film scandalised the American public and was banned in some US states, while the French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as an icon of \"absolute freedom\".Through the late 1950s and 1960s, she became a global phenomenon with roles in The Truth, earning critical acclaim for her dramatic depth; Contempt, a Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece; and Viva Maria!, showcasing her comedic flair alongside Jeanne Moreau.Beyond her most iconic roles, Bardot showcased her versatility in films like Love on a Pillow, where she portrayed a complex, emotionally-torn character, and Two Weeks in September, a romantic drama that highlighted her ability to convey vulnerability.In The Bear and the Doll, she brought playful charm to a comedic role, proving her range across genres. These films, though less celebrated, underscored her ability to captivate audiences in diverse narratives.As well as her work in film, Bardot will also be remembered as a fashion icon, with her blonde tousled hair and bold eyeliner setting beauty trends worldwide. After wearing an off-the-shoulder number in Cannes in 1953, similar styles became known as the Bardot neckline.She was married four times and had one son, Nicolas, with French actor and film producer Jacques Charrier, who died in September.Nicolas later sued his mother for emotional damage after she wrote in an autobiography that she would have preferred to \"give birth to a little dog\".Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty ImagesBardot, Jacques Charrier and their three-day-old son Nicolas in 1960Ruthlessly marketed as a hedonistic sex symbol, Bardot was frustrated in her ambition to become a serious actress.At the height of her fame, she announced she was retiring at the age of 39 to devote her life to animal welfare.\"I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals,\" Bardot famously declared.In 1986, she launched the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which works to protect wild and domestic animals.She became a vegetarian, and in 2013 even threatened to apply for Russian citizenship in protest against plans to kill two sick elephants in a French zoo.Reacting to her death, France's oldest animal protection association - The Société Protectrice des Animaux - paid tribute to an \"iconic and passionate figure for the animal cause\".Charly Hel/Prestige/Getty ImagesBardot, pictured here in 2001, became an increasingly controversial figure in her later lifeBut for all her cinema successes and animal welfare work, Bardot leaves behind a controversial legacy, with a string of remarks later in life about Islam, gay people and the #MeToo movement impacting her reputation.From the late 1990s, Bardot was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred after comments she made online and in interviews about Muslims. She was fined €15,000 (£12,000) in 2008 after complaining on her website that Muslims were \"destroying our country by imposing their ways\".Bardot faced fierce criticism for her 2003 book, A Cry in the Silence, where she argued gay people, modern art, politicians and immigrants destroyed French culture. In 2018, Bardot also dismissed actresses who commented on sexual harassment via the #MeToo movement as \"hypocritical, ridiculous, uninteresting\".\"There are many actresses who flirt with producers in order to get a role,\" Bardot said in an interview with French magazine, Paris Match.",

    "body": "1 day agoVitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russia editorALEXEY NIKOLSKY/SPUTNIK/AFPPutin summoned business leaders to the Kremlin on the day he ordered the full-scale invasion of UkraineDuring the war with Ukraine, the number of billionaires in Russia has reached an all-time high. But in the 25 years Vladimir Putin has been in power, Russia's rich and powerful - known as oligarchs - have lost almost all their political influence.All this is good news for the Russian president. Western sanctions have failed to turn the uber-rich into his opponents, and his carrot-and-stick policies have turned them into silent backers.Former banking billionaire Oleg Tinkov knows exactly how the sticks work. The day after he criticised the war as \"crazy\" in an Instagram post, his executives were contacted by the Kremlin. They were told his Tinkoff Bank, Russia's second-largest at the time, would be nationalised unless all ties to its founder were cut.\"I couldn't discuss the price,\" Tinkov told the New York Times. \"It was like a hostage - you take what you are offered. I couldn't negotiate.\"Within a week, a company linked to Vladimir Potanin - currently Russia's fifth-richest businessman, who supplies nickel for fighter jet engines - announced that it was buying the bank. It was sold for only 3% of its true value, says Tinkov.In the end, Tinkov lost almost $9bn (£6.5bn) of the fortune he once had, and left Russia.Chris Graythen/Getty ImagesOleg Tinkov lost billions and left Russia after criticising the war against UkraineThis is a far cry from the way things were before Putin became president. In the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, some Russians became fabulously rich by taking ownership of massive enterprises formerly owned by the state, and by exploiting the opportunities of their country's nascent capitalism. Their newly acquired wealth brought them influence and power during a period of political turmoil and they became known as oligarchs.Russia's most powerful oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, claimed to have orchestrated Putin's ascent to presidency in 2000, and years later he appealed for forgiveness for doing so: \"I didn't see the future greedy tyrant and usurper in him, the man who would trample freedom and stop Russia's development,\" he wrote in 2012.Berezovsky may have exaggerated his role, but Russia's oligarchs were certainly capable of pulling strings at the highest echelons of power.A little more than a year after his apology, Berezovsky was found dead in mysterious circumstances in exile in the UK. By that time, Russian oligarchy was well and truly dead, too.Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesBoris Berezovsky went into exile in the UK where he later died in mysterious circumstances in 2013So when Putin gathered Russia's richest in the Kremlin hours after ordering the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, there was little they could do to object, even though they knew their fortunes were about to take a massive hit.\"I hope that in these new conditions, we'll work together just as well and no less effectively,\" he told them.One reporter present at the meeting described the assembled billionaires as \"pale and sleep-deprived\". The run-up to the invasion was very bad for Russia's billionaires, and so was its immediate aftermath. According to Forbes magazine, in the year to April 2022, their number fell from 117 to 83 because of the war, sanctions and a weakened rouble. Collectively, they lost $263bn - or 27% of their wealth each on average.But the years that followed showed that immense benefits were to be reaped from being part of Putin's war economy.Lavish spending on the war spurred economic growth of more than 4% a year in Russia in 2023 and 2024. It was good for even those among Russia's ultra-rich who were not making billions directly out of defence contracts.In 2024, more than half of Russia's billionaires either played some role in supplying the military or benefited from the invasion, says Giacomo Tognini, from Forbes's Wealth team.\"That's not even counting those who aren't directly involved, but do need a relationship of sorts with the Kremlin. And I think it's fair to say that anyone running a business in Russia needs to have a relationship with the government,\" he told the BBC.This year saw the highest ever number of billionaires in Russia - 140 - on the Forbes list. Their collective worth ($580bn) was just $3bn shy of the all-time high registered in the year before the invasion.While allowing loyalists to profit, Putin has consistently punished those who have refused to toe the line.Russians remember all too well what happened to oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once Russia's richest man, he spent 10 years in jail after launching a pro-democracy organisation in 2001.AFPMikhail Khodorkovsky was Russia's richest man but he was sent to jail and his oil company Yukos was nationalisedSince the invasion, almost all of Russia's mega-rich have stayed quiet, and those few who have publicly opposed it have had to abandon their country and much of their wealth.Russia's wealthiest are clearly key to Putin's war effort, and many of them, including the 37 business people summoned to the Kremlin on 24 February 2022, have been targeted by Western sanctions.But if the West wanted to make them poorer and turn against the Kremlin, it has failed, given the continuing wealth and absence of dissent among Russian billionaires.If any of them had considered defecting to the West with their billions, the sanctions made that impossible.\"The West did everything possible to ensure that Russian billionaires rallied around the flag,\" says Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). \"There was absolutely no plan, no idea, no clear path for any of them to jump ship. Assets were sanctioned, accounts frozen, property seized. All that effectively helped Putin to mobilise the billionaires, their assets and their money, and use it to support the Russian war economy,\" he tells the BBC.The exodus of foreign companies in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine created a vacuum quickly filled by Kremlin-friendly business people who were allowed to buy up highly lucrative assets on the cheap.This created a new \"army of influential and active loyalists\", argues Alexandra Prokopenko of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\"Their future wellbeing depends on continued confrontation between Russia and the West,\" while their worst fear is the return of the previous owner, she says.In 2024 alone, 11 new billionaires emerged in Russia in this way, according to Giacomo Tognini.Russia's leader has maintained a firm grip on the country's key movers and shakers, despite the war and Western sanctions - and in some respects because of them.",

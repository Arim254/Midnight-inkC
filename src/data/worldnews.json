    "body": "21 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesA Paris court has rejected an effort by the French government to suspend the website of fast-fashion giant Shein in response to it selling childlike sex dolls on its platform.The court said the request for a three-month suspension was \"disproportionate\" - but did order age verification for the sale of adult products.The action against Shein was taken after France's consumer watchdog last month reported it to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" and weapons. Shein said its priority remained protecting French consumers and ensuring compliance.The court acknowledged the seriousness of selling the childlike sex dolls and weapons in its judgement, but said these had been isolated incidents. It noted that the Chinese company had taken action to remove the offending items once it had been made aware of them, and that the issues related to a small number of the hundreds of thousands of products on sale on its site. In response to the initial controversy, Shein announced it would be banning the sale of all sex dolls on its site internationally. A request by the French government for Shein to be forced to suspend the sale of third-party items on its website - the source of the initial offending items - was also rejected. In ordering age verification measures to be put in place for the sale of adult items, the court said the fine for each breach would be €10,000 (£8,700; $11,700). The decision to suspend Shein's website in early November coincided with the company opening its first physical store in the French capital. Its launch drew both shoppers and protesters, with opposition related to the sale of childlike sex dolls, and also its profile as a fast-fashion retailer. Shein said in a statement: \"We remain committed to continuously improving our control processes, in close collaboration with the French authorities, with the aim of establishing some of the most stringent standards in the industry.\"Our priority remains protecting French consumers and ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoHarry SekulichEPAChris Minns, Premier of New South Wales, has pushed for tougher hate speech laws following the Bondi attacksThe Australian state where the Bondi shooting occurred plans to ban the phrase \"globalise the intifada\" as part of a crackdown on \"hateful\" slogans.New South Wales (NSW) premier Chris Minns has also called for a Royal Commission into the Bondi attack, marking the deadliest shooting in Australia in nearly 30 years.Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured last Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by \"Islamic State ideology\", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.Australia's state and federal governments have announced a raft of measures to counter extremism since the attack.Minns plans to recall the state parliament next week to pass through stricter hate speech and gun restrictions. Earlier this week, he also suggested he would tighten protest laws to scale back mass demonstrations to encourage \"a summer of calm\".The premier confirmed he would seek to classify the chant \"globalise the intifada\" as hate speech. Two pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly shouting slogans involving intifada at a demonstration in central London.The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.Earlier this week, Minns, along with the NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane, attended the funeral Matilda, 10, who was the youngest victim of the Bondi shooting. He read out a poem dedicated to the young girl at the event.Prime minister Anthony Albanese has announced a new gun buyback scheme to purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms. Hundreds of thousands of guns will be collected and destroyed, the government predicts.Around 1,000 lifeguards staged a tribute on Saturday, lining up arm-to-arm facing the ocean, on the shorelines of Bondi beach. Surf lifesaving teams at other beaches around Australia were photographed performing a similar memorial.Through the week, Bondi's surf volunteers have been commemorated as some of the heroes of the shooting. Lifeguard Jackson Doolan was photographed sprinting over from a neighbouring beach during the attack carrying a red medical supply bag.Hundreds of swimmers and surfers paddled out at Bondi beach yesterday to create a giant circle to pay tribute to the victims of the attack. On Sunday, Australia will hold a national day of reflection with the theme \"light over darkness\" marking precisely one week after the attack started with a minute's silence at 6:47 pm (0747 GMT).Flags will fly at half-mast and Australians are being asked to light a candle in their windows to honour the victims.\"Sixty seconds carved out from the noise of daily life, dedicated to 15 Australians who should be with us today,\" prime minister Albanese told reporters Saturday.\"It will be a moment of pause to reflect and affirm that hatred and violence will never define us as Australians.\"Bondi's attack was Australia's worst mass shooting since Port Arthur in 1996, where 35 people were killed and prompted then-prime minister John Howard to introduce strict gun control measures.",

    "body": "16 hours agoCachella SmithEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe Trevi Fountain is one of Rome's key attractions with around nine million visitors this yearTourists in Italy's capital Rome will soon have to pay a €2 (£1.75; $2.34) entrance fee if they want to see its famed Trevi Fountain up close.The new barrier for visitors to view the Baroque monument will come into force from 1 February 2026.While the coins tossed into the fountain are donated to charity, the fees collected will go to the city authority to pay for upkeep and managing visitors. The city expects to raise €6.5m a year from the fountain alone.Announcing the move on Friday, Rome's Mayor Roberto ‌Gualtieri was quote by news agency Reuters as saying that \"two euros isn't very much ... and it will lead to less chaotic tourist flows\".The Trevi levy is part of a new tariff system for certain museums and monuments in the Italian capital.Access to a number of sites that currently charge for entry will become free for Rome's residents, such as the Sacred Area of Largo Argentina.At the same time, tourists and non-residents will have to pay to see the Trevi fountain and five other attractions including the Napoleonic Museum.Children under the age of five, and those with disabilities and an accompanying person, will be exempt from the fees.Tourists will still be able to view the Trevi Fountain - built by Italian architect Nicola Salvi in the 18th Century - for free from a distance.The site currently sees an average of 30,000 visitors per day, according to the City of Rome.Following restoration work which took place last year, Gualtieri introduced a queuing system to prevent large crowds massing around the landmark.Access is capped at 400 people at the same time.",

    "body": "2 days agoHugh Schofield,ParisandLaura GozziA former anaesthetist has been jailed for life for intentionally poisoning 30 patients, 12 of them fatally.Frédéric Péchier, 53,  was convicted Friday at the end of a four-month trial in the eastern city of Besançon.In one of France's biggest ever medical malpractice cases, Péchier was found to have introduced chemicals like potassium chloride or adrenaline into the infusion bags of patients. His youngest victim, a four-year-old child, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"The chemicals Péchier added triggered cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients, which required emergency intervention in the operating theatre.This was often provided by Péchier himself, who was then able to pose as the patient's saviour.But in 12 cases he was unable to intervene, or it was too late, and the patient died.The prosecution argued that Péchier acted in order to discredit fellow anaesthetists against whom he bore a grudge.In most of the operations, he was not the primary anaesthetist. It was alleged he came in early to the clinic to tamper with the infusion bags.Then, when things went wrong, he was able to step in after diagnosing the problem and ordering an antidote.Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. The alert was raised in 2017 after a surfeit of potassium chloride was found in the infusion bag of a woman who had a heart attack while being operated on for a back complaint.Investigators found a pattern of \"serious adverse events\" at the Saint-Vincent private clinic in Besançon. While the national average for fatal heart attacks under anaesthetic was 1 in 100,000, at the clinic it was more than six times that.And in most cases nationally, an explanation for the heart attack was subsequently found, whereas at Saint-Vincent the cause remained a mystery.It was also found that the \"serious adverse events\" ceased when Péchier left for a short period to work at another clinic, which itself then saw an uptick. Then when he returned to Saint-Vincent, the emergencies resumed there. When he was disbarred from practising in 2017, the anomaly stopped.Péchier's first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. \"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.According to the trial prosecutor: \"His colleagues said he always seemed to have the answer. That he made himself out to be the best, that he created this character of the saviour, so that colleagues would instinctively turn to him.\"Péchier denied the charges and his lawyers argued that there was no hard proof linking him to the crimes. But his own testimony varied in the trial, and he ended up admitting there must have been a poisoner at large in the clinic, but it was not him.The son of two parents in the medical profession, Péchier was described by a court psychologist as having a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality – one side respectable, the other side capable of doing great harm. In 2014 and again in 2021 he made attempts to kill himself.A divorced father of three children, he told the court before the verdict that his sole concern was to protect his family. His children wept as the sentence was read but he remained impassive.\"It's the end of a nightmare,\" said survivor Sandra Simard. Another patient who survived, Jean-Claude Gandon, said: \"We can have an easier Christmas now.\"",

    "body": "The Australian government has announced a gun buyback scheme in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack - its deadliest mass shooting in decades.The scheme is the largest since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, which left 35 people dead and prompted Australia to introduce world-leading gun control measures.Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured on Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by \"Islamic State ideology\", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.On Friday, police also said there was no ongoing reason to detain a group of men who were arrested in Sydney over their \"extremist Islamic ideology\".Police allege Sunday's attack, which they have declared a terrorist incident, was committed by a father-son duo. Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.The day after the shooting, national cabinet - which includes representatives from the federal government and leaders from all states and territories - agreed to tighten gun controls.Speaking to media on Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there are now more than 4 million firearms in Australia - more than at the time of the Port Arthur massacre.\"We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns. \"If you're going to reduce the number of guns, then a buyback scheme has to be a piece of that puzzle,\" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett added.The new scheme will purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms, and will be funded on a 50-50 basis with the states and territories. Hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed, the government estimates.National cabinet has also agreed to impose limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual, restrict open-ended firearms licensing and the types of guns that are legal and make Australian citizenship a condition of holding a firearm licence. Work on a national firearms register will be accelerated and firearm regulators will have better access to criminal intelligence.On Friday, New South Wales Police said they were preparing to release seven men with extremist ideology, but that they would continue to be monitored.Tactical officers swarmed on the group, who had travelled from Victoria and were known to police there, in dramatic scenes in the suburb of Liverpool on Thursday. Officers found a knife, but no guns or other weapons.NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference there is \"no confirmed link\" between the alleged terrorists and the detained group, but that Bondi Beach was one of several locations the latter was intending to visit.\"Whilst this specific threat posed by the males is unknown, I can say that the potential [for] a violent offence being committed was such that we were not prepared to tolerate the risk,\" Commissioner Lanyon said.",

    "body": "16 hours agoMartin YipandSeher AsafWatch: Video shows smoke filling Taipei metro stationAt least three people have been killed and nine others injured as a knife-wielding attacker ‍went ‍on a ​rampage in the Taiwanese capital Taipei.The 27-year-old suspect set off smoke bombs at Taipei's main metro station, before running to another station in a busy shopping district, stabbing people along the way, Taiwanese Premier Cho Jung-tai said. The suspect, named by officials as Taiwanese man Chang Wen, later died after falling from a multi-storey building, Cho added. His motive remains unclear.Attacks of this kind are rare in Taiwan, which has low rates of violent crime. The last time a similar incident struck Taipei was more than a decade ago in 2014.Friday's attack took place at about 17:20 local time (09:20 GMT) during the city's evening rush hour.Videos shared on social media show people fleeing the scene in panic as an individual wearing a baseball cap and black clothing lobs smoke bombs across a busy road.He can then be seen carrying a large knife as he walks past several cars. Cho said the suspect had detonated smoke bombs and Molotov cocktails at Taipei's Main Station, which is connected to a busy underground shopping street. A man reportedly tried to stop the attacker but was struck with a blunt object and later died in hospital.The suspect then fled through an underground shopping centre to the nearby Zhongshan Station, about a 800m walk away. After a detour to his hotel, where he picked up a weapon, he ran back to the street outside Zhongshan Station and set off further smoke bombs. He also stabbed more people.The attacker went into a nearby bookshop and department store, but fell from the building after police surrounded him. He died shortly after in hospital.Cho said he had ordered increased security at metro and railway stations, as well as airports, in response to the attack.\"We will ‌investigate [the suspect's] background and associated relationships to understand his motives and ‍determine ‌if there are other connected factors,\" the Taiwanese premier was quoted by news agency Reuters as saying. Taiwan's President William Lai also promised a swift investigation. The suspect had a criminal record and was wanted by the authorities, according to local media reports.The last major incident of this kind, in 2014, saw a man kill four people on an underground train in Taipei, shocking people in Taiwan. The perpetrator of that attack was executed two years later.",

    "body": "The widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has said the Turning Point USA organisation he founded will help elect JD Vance as president in 2028, despite the current US vice-president having yet to announce he is running.Erika Kirk's endorsement on Thursday came on the opening day of Turning Point's annual America Fest conference, the organisation's largest gathering since her husband was shot dead in September.\"We are going to get my husband's friend, JD Vance, elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,\" Kirk said, referring to the 48th president. Trump is the 47th.Vance, meanwhile, is scheduled to speak at the event on Sunday.Turning Point has been credited with helping Republican President Donald Trump expand his coalition of support, leading to his 2024 presidential election victory.Her announcement ahead of Trump's one-year mark in office signals early jockeying to be his successor ahead of the 2028 election.After Kirk gave her opening remarks, the stage at the Phoenix Convention Center in Arizona turned into a political mudslinging contest as tensions within the conservative movement were laid bare.Podcaster Ben Shapiro lobbed attacks at media rivals Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly and Steve Bannon, calling them \"fraudsters and grifters\".  \"The people who refused to condemn Candace's truly vicious attacks - and some of them are speaking here tonight - are guilty of cowardice,\" Shapiro said.Owens, a former Turning Point employee who hosts a popular podcast, has been a thorn in Republicans' side and pushed various conspiracy theories, including baseless suggestions about Charlie Kirk's murder. It comes at a time when there has been growing speculation about Trump's hold on the Republican party and infighting among factions of the president's supporters about the future of the Maga movement.Shapiro also criticised former Fox News host Carlson for interviewing Nick Fuentes, a far-right political commentator and Holocaust denier, on his podcast in late October, drawing widespread condemnation. After Shapiro, Carlson took the stage and shot back at Shapiro.\"That guy is pompous,\" Carlson said. \"Calls to deplatform at a Charlie Kirk event? That's hilarious.\"  Charlie Kirk's Turning Point events were known for addressing controversial and divisive topics. Supporters saw it as necessary for free speech. Critics saw it as hate-mongering. Authorities said Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin - Tyler Robinson - told his romantic partner that he killed Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred\". Erika Kirk told the Turning Point conference: \"You won't agree with everyone on this stage this weekend. And that's okay. Welcome to America.\"Since the assassination, she said, \"we've seen fractures, we've seen bridges being burned that shouldn't be burnt\". Trump has recently encountered a series of setbacks within his Republican party, including a public falling out with his former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene and the impending release of the Epstein files, which a majority of Republicans voted for despite Trump's initial discouragement.The four-day America Fest conference was scheduled to continue through the weekend, with Vance and Donald Trump Jr scheduled as guest speakers on Sunday.

    "body": "2 hours agoCarrie Davies,BBC Pakistan correspondentandAnna LamcheFormer Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been sentenced to further jail terms following a fraud case involving state gifts.They were convicted of breaking Pakistan's rules on gifts after Bibi was given a luxury jewellery set by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman during a 2021 state visit.The pair are already serving time in prison for earlier convictions, and the new sentences - 10 years for criminal breach of trust and seven years for criminal misconduct, and a fine - will reportedly run concurrently to their earlier terms.Khan has described the charges as politically motivated and his lawyer told BBC News his team plan to challenge the verdict.Speaking to the BBC after the sentencing, the former prime minister's lawyer, Salman Safdar, said Khan's legal team had only been informed about the sentencing late on Friday night, after normal court hours.They planned to mount a challenge to the verdict in the high court, Mr Safdar said.This case is the latest in a series of charges laid against the cricket star-turned-politician, who has been detained since August 2023. In January, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison over a separate corruption case.He has faced charges in more than 100 cases, ranging from leaking state secrets to selling state gifts. The BBC has been unable to confirm the exact number brought against him.The jewellery case, referred to as Toshakhana 2 in Pakistan, concerns a Bulgari jewellery set given to Bushra Bibi by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a state visit in 2021, according to court documents. Under Pakistan's rules on state gifts, these items go to Pakistan's Toshakana department (state treasury), but politicians are able to purchase the items back.Khan is alleged to have asked a private firm to undervalue the jewellery set, before purchasing it back at a significantly reduced price.In addition to their jail terms, the pair were handed a fine of over 16 million Pakistani rupees (£42,600).Khan has previously been acquitted in a separate Toshakhana case.The former leader still has other cases outstanding against him.These include terrorism charges relating to violent protests that took place on 9 May 2023, when he was previously arrested.Khan was Pakistan's prime minister until April 2022 when he was ousted in a vote of no confidence.Although he has not been seen in public, his social media accounts have continued to operate with messages attributed to him on X often appearing after jail visits.These have been highly critical of Pakistan's current government and its politically powerful army Chief Field Marshall Asim Munir, including posts calling him a tyrannical dictator.In November, he was denied any visitors for nearly a month.After campaigning by his family and party, his sister was allowed to visit in early December; a few hours after she saw him, his account posted a comment credited to Khan calling the Field Marshall Asim Munir a \"mentally unstable person\". Khan has not been allowed any family visits since.The judgement states the judge was lenient in sentencing because of Khan's \"old age\".",

    "body": "19 hours agoBethany BellViennaGetty ImagesFernando P being escorted into the regional court in Aachen, western GermanyA court in the German city of Aachen has sentenced a man to eight-and-a-half years in prison for repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, filming the acts and then posting them online.The man, named only as Fernando P in line with German privacy laws, was found guilty of aggravated rape, grievous bodily harm and violation of personal privacy.The court found the 61-year-old, who is originally from Spain, guilty of sedating and raping his wife at their home for a period of several years from 2018 to 2024.A spokesperson for the court, Katharina Effert, said the man also filmed the abuse and shared it online. \"He uploaded videos of these acts to chat groups and internet platforms, making them available to other users,\" she said.Much of the trial was held behind closed doors to protect the identity of his wife.Her lawyer, Nicole Servaty, told journalists that she \"really had a voice in this proceeding\", adding: \"She was able to testify, to express her feelings and everything that has burdened her.\"She said the ruling could not make up for what happened. \"But it might help a bit to cope with things and process them.\"The verdict is still subject to appeal.Getty ImagesFernando P was seen with his hoodie obscuring his face as he awaited the verdict in courtGerman media say the case bears similarities to the high-profile case in France last year concerning Dominique Pelicot. He was found guilty of secretly drugging his wife, Gisèle, and inviting scores of men to rape her while she was unconscious for years.Gisèle's decision to waive her anonymity and hold a public trial turned her into a feminist icon, celebrated for her powerful testimony and courage.Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office, the BKA, says that the victims of sedation and subsequent sexual abuse are \"almost exclusively women\".It says such crimes \"usually take place by exploiting a relationship of trust\" in marriage, partnerships, families or among close acquaintances.",

Mrndzic was found guilty by a jury in October 2024 on several counts of criminal fraud and misrepresentation in relation to his successful application for a US passport and naturalisation certificate.He failed to disclose to immigration authorities the nature and timing of his military service, or that \"he persecuted Bosnian-Serb inmates as a prison guard\", the justice department said.Mrndzic was sentenced in January 2025 to more than five years in prison.

    "body": "21 hours agoMalu CursinoGetty ImagesNorway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit will likely need a lung transplant as her health has worsened in recent months, the country's royal household has said.The princess, 52, was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2018. The degenerative disease creates scar tissue that stiffens the lungs making it difficult to breathe and for oxygen to enter the bloodstream.Tests in autumn showed \"a clear worsening\" of her health, the palace said on Friday. \"We are reaching the point where a lung transplant will be necessary,\" Are Martin Holm, head of respiratory medicine at Oslo University Hospital, said.Princess Mette-Marit told public broadcaster NRK that her illness had developed \"faster than I'd hoped\".No decision has been taken yet on whether she will be placed on the transplant waiting list, Dr Holm said. The palace said her doctors had started the process towards an evaluation for lung transplant surgery.In Norway, there are usually between 20 and 40 patients on the waiting list for a lung transplant and Princess Mette-Marit will not be given preferential treatment if she is placed on the list, local media reports.Although she is not yet on a donor list, Dr Holm said her healthcare team was \"undertaking the necessary preparations to ensure that [a transplant] will be possible when the time comes\".The palace said Princess Mette-Marit had \"an increasing need\" for rest and a targeted exercise regimen.However, she had \"expressed a strong interest in continuing to carry out her duties\", it added in a statement on Friday. Her royal duties and engagements will adapted to her ongoing health issues.Dr Holm described pulmonary fibrosis to reporters as a \"dangerous disease\" that often could not be seen because it depended on how sick an individual was. At rest, they might be able to breathe normally, he explained, but when they exert themselves - through exercise, for example - their lungs \"can no longer keep up\".ReutersHiking or skiing - activities Princess Mette-Marit enjoys with her husband, Crown Prince Haakon (left) - are no longer possiblePrincess Mette-Marit's husband, Prince Haakon, Norway's future king, sat beside her for an interview with NRK, in which he explained that she may appear \"perfectly fine\" when sitting still, but said he had noticed her struggling more with breathing.He also said she had less energy and was getting ill more often.Hiking or skiing together - activities the pair enjoy - were no longer possible, the crown prince added.The thought of the transplant alone had been demanding, Mette-Marit said, as she knew it will involve risks. A successful transplant hinges on several factors, including finding the right match and ensuring the body does not reject the new organ.Transplant is seen as a last resort, Dr Holm explained, telling reporters that individuals must be significantly ill and have a limited life expectancy before a lung transplant can be deemed appropriate.News of the princess's deteriorating health comes months after her eldest son was charged with 32 offences, including four counts of rape.Marius Borg Høiby, 28, denies the most serious accusations against him, but plans to plead guilty to some lesser charges when the trial begins, his lawyer Petar Sekulic told news agency Reuters in August.Mr Høiby is the stepson of the heir to the Norwegian throne, but does not have any royal title or official duties.",

    "body": "12 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia Editor, MoscowReporters ask world leaders questions all the time.No big deal. Right?But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of \"the export of chaos\"?And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.\"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. \"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.Putin returns to my question.\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.",

    "body": "16 hours agoLucy HookerBusiness reporterThe ousted chair of Ben & Jerry's has accused the company which owns the brand of threatening to launch a public smear campaign against her. Anuradha Mittal, who chaired Ben & Jerry's independent board for seven years, told the BBC that Magnum had threatened to publish \"defamatory statements\" about her if she did not step down from her role.It relates to an increasingly bitter dispute between the Vermont-based activist ice cream maker and its owner over the independence of the board and its freedom to pursue its social missions.Magnum said in its view Mittal \"no longer met the criteria to serve\" on the board, following an investigation it had commissioned by external advisors.In a statement on Monday, Magnum outlined changes to the way the board operates including a nine-year limit for people serving on it. As well as Mittal, who said she had received a letter telling her she had been removed from the board, two other board members will be required to leave as a result.It also said that an audit of the Ben & Jerry's Foundation, a charitable organisation, had \"identified a series of material deficiencies in financial controls, governance and other compliance policies, including conflicts of interest\".Speaking to the BBC's World Business Report, Mittal said there had been an escalation of the friction between Ben & Jerry's board and its owner, over the brand's independence, social mission and integrity.\"For several years now, we have been resisting their overreach, including their efforts to muzzle us from speaking out for human rights, for peace,\" she said.The brand, which is also known for the playful puns in its flavour names, was owned by Unilever until earlier this month, when the household goods giant spun off its ice cream unit to create, Magnum Ice Cream Company.Ben & Jerry's was sold to Unilever in 2000 in a deal which allowed it to retain an independent board and the right to make decisions about its social mission.This was a frequent source of friction while owned by Unilever.In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel, resulting in its Israeli operation being sold by Unilever to a local licensee, and in October, Ben Cohen said it was prevented from launching an ice cream which expressed \"solidarity with Palestine\".This row has now been inherited by Magnum, culminating in this week's stand-off, and Mittal's removal.\"This October, Unilever-Magnum executives threatened me with defamatory statements in their forthcoming prospectus if I did not resign,\" Mittal said.\"At the same time, they offered me a prominent role in a multimillion dollar Unilever-funded non-profit if I gave in,\" she added.She said she had turned down that \"inappropriate\" offer.Magnum is now the world's largest ice cream maker, with its brands include Cornetto, Wall's and Carte D'Or.Mittal, founder of the Oakland Institute, a human rights and development focused think tank in California, described Magnum's approach as a \"public smear campaign\" and said the allegations were unfounded.One of the firm's original founders Jerry Greenfield left the firm in September saying he felt its social mission was being stifled. The other, Ben Cohen, has also hit out at Magnum saying it was \"not fit\" to own the firm.In a statement a spokesperson for Magnum said the steps it had taken were aimed at strengthening corporate governance and to \"reaffirm the responsibilities of the Board of Ben & Jerry's\".\"These actions aim to preserve and enhance the brand's historical social mission and safeguard its essential integrity,\" a spokesperson said.When Ben & Jerry's was created in 1978 it made its mark selling flavours such as Cherry Garcia named after the guitarist from rock band Grateful Dead, Bohemian Raspberry, a play on the Queen track, and the now discontinued Vermonty Python.Magnum said in its statement: \"We remain unequivocally committed to Ben & Jerry's three-part mission – product, economic and social – and its progressive, non-partisan values.\"Ben & Jerry's continues to advocate for a range of causes and be a bold voice for social justice, as a glance at its social media channels demonstrates.\"",

Russia has already launched legal action against the clearing house.Russian President Vladimir Putin accused EU leaders of attempted robbery on Friday and Kirill Dmitriev, his envoy in talks with the US, claimed their failure to agree on using the assets was a \"fatal blow\".However, Belgium's Bart De Wever said the deal eventually agreed after almost 17 hours of negotiations was a \"victory for Ukraine, a victory for financial stability... and a victory for the EU\". EU ⁠leaders had avoided \"chaos ‍and ‍division\", he added.Ukraine needs an estimated €137bn over the next two years to cover both its military and its public services, and the EU plan is to cover two-thirds of that.The €90bn that the EU will raise on the capital markets as part of the loan deal will be \"backed by EU budget headroom\" - the margin between actual EU contributions by member states in a year and the maximum the European Commission can spend as part of the budget. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to European leaders for the \"significant support that truly strengthens our resilience\".Germany's Friedrich Merz had been a strong supporter of the plan to use Russia's frozen assets. Although the idea has not been dropped, the decision to borrow the money against the EU budget instead is seen as a setback for him. Nevertheless, he declared that it \"sends a clear signal from Europe to Putin\".Two countries, Hungary and Slovakia, refused to back the compromise deal, while the Czech Republic said it would not guarantee the loan.Hungary's Viktor Orban, seen as Vladimir Putin's closest partner in the EU, has opposed handing any more money to Ukraine, arguing it prolongs the war, and he has condemned the deal.Viktor Orban/XViktor Orban posted a photo of him in the centre, with Slovakia's Robert Fico on the right and Czech PM Andrej Babis on the left\"It looks like a loan, but the Ukrainians will never be able to pay it back,\" he told reporters. \"It is basically losing money.\"Like Orban, Slovakia's Robert Fico refused to back more funding to allow Ukraine to continue its defence against Russia, but Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis was careful to point out he agreed to the summit's conclusions \"on condition we don't guarantee the loans\".Billionaire populist Babis only just formed a government this week, and his stance is a signficant departure from the previous government's staunch support for Ukraine.The EU summit took place as US talks with Russia were set to continue, spearheaded by US President Donald Trump, who said this week that a solution was closer than ever.Dmitriev is expected to meet Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Miami at the weekend, according to reports.Meanwhile, a Ukrainian delegation is also due in Miami for talks with their US counterparts, days after Kushner and Witkoff met them and European leaders in Berlin.European allies have made a series of proposals to end the war that include a multinational force as part of \"robust security guarantees\" for Ukraine.Putin has criticised the European approach, saying he had already agreed to several compromises at his meeting with Trump in Alaska in August. Praising Trump's \"serious efforts to end this conflict\", the Russian leader said \"the ball is entirely and fully in the court of our Western opponents... the head of the Kyiv regime and its European sponsors\".Putin's demands were largely reflected in an initial US peace plan and include Ukraine handing over large areas of its own territory.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the deal agreed by the EU boosted the Ukrainian position: \"There ​is a chance that these negotiations will be ‌about peace not ‍on ‌Russian terms, but on terms that can somehow be accepted and considered ‍acceptable by all parties ‍to this conflict.\"Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed it would be \"useful\" for Europe to re-engage with Putin.\"I believe that it's in our interest as Europeans and Ukrainians to find the right framework to re-engage this discussion,\" he said, adding that Europeans should find the means to do so \"in coming weeks\".",

    "body": "1 day agoPeter Hoskins,business reporterandLily Jamali,North America technology correspondentWatch: What does TikTok's deal mean for America's users?TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has signed binding agreements with American and global investors to operate its business in the US, the video platform's boss told employees on Thursday.Half of the joint venture will be owned by a group of investors including Oracle, Silver Lake and the Emirati investment firm MGX, according to a memo sent by chief executive Shou Zi Chew.The deal, which is set to close on 22 January, would end years of efforts by Washington to force ByteDance to sell its US operations over national security concerns.It is in ​line with a deal unveiled in September, when US President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a law that would ban the app unless it was sold.TikTok said in the memo that the deal would enable \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part of a vital global community\".Under the agreement, ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, while Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will hold 15% each.Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo.The White House previously said that Oracle, which was co-founded by Trump supporter Larry Ellison, will license TikTok's recommendation algorithm as part of the deal.The deal comes after a series of delays.In April 2024, during President Joe Biden's administration, the US Congress passed a law to ban the app over national security concerns, unless it was sold.The law was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked out a deal to transfer ownership.Trump said in September that he had spoken on the phone to China's President Xi Jinping, who he said had given the deal the go-ahead.The platform's future remained unclear after the leaders met face-to-face in October.The app's fate was clouded by ongoing tensions between the two nations on other matters including trade.\"TikTok has become a bargaining chip in the wider US-China relationship,\" said Alvin Graylin, a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\"With recent softening tensions, Beijing's sign-off on the structure and algorithm licensing now looks less like capitulation and more like calibrated de-escalation, letting both capitals claim a win at home.\" The White House referred the BBC to TikTok when contacted for comment.Oracle and Silver Lake declined to comment. The BBC has contacted MGX for comment.The deal drew critiques from Senate Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, who said it would not do \"a thing to protect the privacy of American user\".Under the terms, TikTok's recommendation algorithm is set to be retrained on US user data to ensure feeds are free from external manipulation.\"It's unclear that it will even put TikTok's algorithm in safer hands,\" said Wyden.He opposed the 2024 law and was among US lawmakers who lobbied to extend the TikTok deadline in January in a bid to give Congress more time to mitigate threats from China.Some users also expressed caution at the prospect of new investors.Small business owner Tiffany Cianci, who has more than 300,000 followers and nearly four million likes on the platform, said she hopes the incoming investors will maintain the same user experience for entrepreneurs like her.\"I hope small business owners are protected,\" she said.TikTok has said that more than seven million small businesses market their products and services on TikTok in the US.\"I reserve judgement on whether or not we have saved the app for those small businesses,\" Ms Cianci said.She added that she chose TikTok for promotion because the platform offered profit-sharing on terms that are more favourable than what competitors like Meta offered.Over the last year, Ms Cianci has been active in organising protests in Washington and on TikTok aimed at saving the app.",

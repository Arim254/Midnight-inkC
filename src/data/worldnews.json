    "body": "Australian PM apologises after calling child sex abuse survivor and advocate 'difficult'4 hours agoLana LamSydneyGettyGrace Tame says Anthony Albanese used \"misogynist's code\" in calling her \"difficult\"Australia's prime minister has apologised for calling a former Australian of the Year and sexual abuse survivor \"difficult\", saying it was only in reference to the hardships she has faced.During a one-word response game, Anthony Albanese used the adjective to describe Grace Tame, who was named the 2021 Australian of the Year for her advocacy for child sexual abuse survivors.Tame, 31, said the description was \"misogynist's code for a woman who won't comply. History tends to call her 'courageous'.\"It prompted Albanese to apologise \"if there was any misinterpretation\" and that Tame \"has had a very difficult life, but she deserves great credit for turning that into a benefit for others\".But hours later, Tame dismissed Albanese's apology, taking to Instagram to post: \"Spare me the condescension, old man. We all know what you meant.\"Greens leader Larissa Waters posted on X that calling Tame difficult was \"completely unwarranted\".\"Labelling women as difficult won't silence us. It won't stop us speaking truth to power. Next time try 'unbreakable' or 'warrior' or 'fierce', Prime Minister,\" she wrote. On Wednesday, other answers that Albanese gave during the rapid-response quiz included \"president\" for Donald Trump, , \"leader\" for the new head of the opposition coalition Angus Taylor and \"divisive\" for Pauline Hanson, leader of anti-immigration party One Nation. When asked for a response to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, he said \"grub\" which drew applause from the audience.Tame was awarded Australian of the Year in recognition of her tireless efforts to overturn laws in the state of Tasmania that made it illegal for victims of sexual abuse to speak publicly about their experiences. From the age of 15, Tame was groomed and raped by her 58-year-old maths teacher Nicolaas Ockert Bester. He was later found guilty and served one year and nine months in jail for sexually abusing Tame when she was his student in 2011. In 2022, videos and images of Tame refusing to smile at an official event with the then-prime minister Scott Morrison went viral.She had been openly critical about Morrison over his government's response to sexual assault allegations and a toxic workplace culture in parliament in the wake of  political staffer Brittany Higgins' allegation that she was raped in her boss's office in 2019.The phrase is currently under consideration to be banned as part of new laws cracking down on \"hateful\" slogans after the Bondi Beach shootings. The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.",

    "body": "16 hours agoPaulin KolaEPAMost of the victims were young and relatives are still struggling to comprehendThe Swiss government has announced an emergency payout of 50,000 francs ($65,000;  £48,000) for the victims of the deadly fire at the ski bar resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve.The so-called solidarity contribution will go to each of the 115 injured and the families of the 41 who died, the Federal Council said. Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire at Le Constellation bar began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foam that lined the ceiling of the bar's basement, which was packed with people.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and 58 people are still being treated in hospital for severe burns.The announcement of the payout was made by Swiss President Guy Parmelin and Finance Minister Beat Jans.They said the one-off sum would be in addition to the emergency aid of 10,000 francs offered by the regional government of the canton of Valais where Carns-Montana is situated and \"intended to offer rapid, un-bureaucratic assistance to those affected\". The federal government is also pledging to provide funding of up to 20m francs in addition to facilitating talks between the victims, officials and insurers to reach amicable compensation agreements, Jans said. \"The Federal Council shares with the victims and their families the desire for truth and justice,\" Parmelin told a press conference. \"We, too, want to know what happened, why, and how it could have been prevented.\"Local authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.The owners of the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Criminal proceedings have also been brought against the municipality's head of public safety and a former council fire safety inspector.",

He was found dead on Monday.Local media say the alleged attack may have been aimed at a family with links to organised crime.The two men were refused bail and will appear in court on Thursday.Investigators say more arrests are likely as they believe others are involved in the alleged kidnapping and murder.The two men, aged 24 and 29, were arrested earlier on Wednesday, as forensic testing confirmed that a body located near a golf course on the city outskirts belonged to Baghsarian.They were charged with murder and detaining a person with intent to ransom and occasion actual bodily harm.Both were previously known to authorities for minor matters.Police said: \"Early inquiries established that Chris Baghsarian was not the intended target of the kidnapping and had been taken in a case of mistaken identity.\"Baghsarian's family have welcomed news of the arrests, and requested the media respect their privacy. New South Wales Robbery and Serious Crime Squad Commander Andrew Marks described the attack as \"somebody's worst nightmare\".\"The fact that an innocent man was taken from his home is not acceptable,\" he said, quoted by AFP.\"These people need to be held to account for that.\"In the days after the kidnapping, police made several pleas for those who had taken Baghsarian to safely return him as he had health issues and needed daily medication.Police have said the discovery of two burnt-out cars and a raid on an abandoned property in Dural, an outer suburb of Sydney, led them to an area in nearby Pitt Town where they found the remains.Authorities have urged any witnesses who saw anything near the golf course on 14 February - the day after the kidnapping - to contact police.",

    "body": "7 hours agoKelly NgAFP via Getty ImagesTommy Schaefer and his then-girlfriend Heather Mack were jailed for the shocking murder of Mack's mother Indonesia has deported a US man who spent 11 years in jail for the high-profile \"suitcase murder\" of his girlfriend's mother on the resort island of Bali. In 2014, Tommy Schaefer was on holiday in Bali with his then-girlfriend Heather Mack and her mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack. The couple conspired to kill Wiese-Mack, reportedly to gain access to a $1.5m (£1.17m) trust fund.Her body was later discovered stuffed inside a suitcase. Schaefer was released from a Bali jail on Tuesday morning after receiving a number of remissions for good behaviour. But the 33-year-old will still face federal charges in the US and is due to appear before the court in Chicago on Thursday, according to reports.Shortly before boarding his flight back to the US on Tuesday night, Schaefer apologised for his actions. \"I'm sorry. I'm always sorry. I'm always sorry,\" Schaefer told AFP news agency.\"I was thrust into this situation, but I take full responsibility for everything I have done and I hope Sheila's family finds peace.\"In 2015, an Indonesia court sentenced Schaefer to 18 years in jail and Mack to 10 years, for what the presiding judge called a \"sadistic\" killing.Prosecutors had said that Mack - who was 18 at the time of the murder and pregnant - covered her mother's mouth while Schaefer struck her in the head with a fruit bowl. The body was stuffed inside a suitcase and left it in the boot of a taxi, prosecutors said. The driver later alerted police.The couple was later discovered staying at another hotel in Bali.Schaefer, then 21, said on trial that he had been defending himself after Wiese-Mack became angry after learning that her daughter was pregnant. Mack was given a shorter sentence due to her lesser role and because she gave birth to a baby while on trial, the Bali court heard. She too was released early and deported in 2021. She was arrested immediately upon arriving in the US and charged with conspiracy to kill a US national and obstruction of justice - and eventually sentenced to 26 years in jail. Mack originally pleaded not guilty to the US charges on conspiring to kill a US national, but changed her plea after the prosecutors offered to ask for a shorter sentence.Mack has given media interviews over the years from prison, where she recounted the incident and her troubled relationship with her mother.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKoh EweandDanny Vincent,Hong KongGetty ImagesJimmy Lai was sentenced to nearly six years in jail in 2022 for a fraud offenceJimmy Lai, Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon, has won an appeal against a fraud conviction in 2022, which had seen him sentenced to nearly six years in jail. On Thursday, Hong Kong's Court of Appeal quashed the convictions of Lai and another defendant who had been accused of illegally subletting office space.But the 78-year-old will remain in prison. Earlier this month, he was sentenced to 20 years in jail for colluding with foreign forces under the city's national security law.Lai, a British citizen, is a fierce critic of Beijing and is one of the biggest figures in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. He has been detained since 2020.Lai's daughter Claire described the ruling on Thursday as \"nothing more than a PR move by the Hong Kong authorities\". \"No one should be fooled into thinking.. [it] is anything more,\" she told the BBC.\"The rule of law is broken there, and my father is still unjustly imprisoned and will remain so for nearly 20 years unless urgent action is taken to secure his release.\"Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, who leads Lai's international legal team, echoed this, saying the decision \"changes nothing\" and that Lai risks dying in prison because of ill health.\"No one should be fooled into thinking that this fraud appeal belatedly succeeding suggests the Hong Kong system operates fairly or justly,\" she told the BBC.In 1995, Lai founded Apple Daily, a local tabloid that was critical of Beijing and became Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy paper. The paper was shuttered in 2021 after Lai and other key staff members were arrested.The paper was at the heart of Lai's fraud trial. Prosecutors argued that Lai breached lease terms by allowing his private consultancy firm to operate in office space that Apple Daily had rented.Wong Wai-keung, a former executive at Lai's media company, was also charged in the same case and jailed for 21 months.Critics say Lai's trials and detention are a sign of the shrinking civil liberties in Hong Kong, especially after the introduction of a Beijing-imposed national security law.This month, the UK and the US governments said the national security law has been used to \"silence\" activists like Lai.But Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have argued that the law is necessary to maintain stability and deny it has weakened the territory's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China. Rights groups and Lai's family have raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison. Last December Claire Lai told the BBC that her father's teeth were rotting and his fingernails \"sometimes fall off\".But Chinese authorities maintained that Lai was \"in good health\" and received \"appropriate\" care.Supporters claim that Jimmy Lai has long been facing political persecution through the courts. The overturning of the sentence on Thursday has been met with some scepticism by some.\"Even if [he] is released at 96 rather than 98, it doesn't make much difference,\" one supporter who attended court told the BBC.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Spain declassifies files on 1981 attempted coup in effort to dispel conspiracy theories13 hours agoGuy Hedgecoe,BBC Madrid correspondentandRobert Greenall,BBC NewsGetty ImagesCoup leader Antonio Tejero Molina died on the very same day as the files were declassified.Spain's government has released dozens of documents related to an attempted coup that took place 45 years ago - regarded as a key moment in the country's history.A group of armed officers burst into parliament and threatened MPs, aiming to overthrow the country's fledgling democracy and return it to dictatorship. Their efforts failed when King Juan Carlos refused to support them. However, conspiracy theories have abounded since, including that the king may have had prior knowledge of the coup or even that he may have been actively involved. The release of the files also came on the same day as the death of the coup's leader, Antonio Tejero Molina, at the age of 93. Tejero's lawyer described him as a \"man of honour, unwavering faith, and great love for Spain\".\"May God grant him the peace that men denied him,\" he wrote on X on behalf of his family.On 23 February 1981, a group of officers led by Tejero burst into the main chamber of the national parliament, wielding guns and threatening the politicians as a new government was being sworn in. Their aim was to return authoritarianism - six years after the death of the country's dictator Francisco Franco.A photo of Tejero brandishing a handgun in the parliament as MPs take cover is perhaps the most famous image of the coup.Getty ImagesKing Juan Carlos ascended the throne two days after the death of Gen Francisco FrancoThe release of the 153 classified files generated enormous expectation - so much so that the government web page where the documents were to be posted collapsed temporarily. They include police and judicial reports, transcriptions of conversations between officials, and the reactions of foreign governments to the events.But the files themselves appear to contain no explosive revelations. Franco - Spain's brutal dictator - died in 1975, paving the way for the introduction of a parliamentary monarchy.Six years later, Spain's fragile democracy appeared to hang in the balance for several hours as the coup attempt took place. Eventually, it failed, after the young king addressed Spaniards - and the armed forces - via a televised message, expressing his opposition to the rebels and ordering all military to remain in their barracks.For many Spaniards, the episode sealed Juan Carlos's status as the saviour of their young democracy and the country's rejection of Francoist values.However, in the decades since, many have cast doubt over the supposedly heroic role of the king. Other theories claimed the uprising was a set-up by the political establishment aimed at providing a test that would reinforce the country's democracy.The current, Socialist-led government of Pedro Sánchez said having documents related to this event under lock and key was an \"historical anomaly\" that needed to be corrected and that their release posed no risk to anyone. It also said their declassification would serve to undermine those peddling false theories about the coup.However, there were some interesting revelations in the files, including that six members of the intelligence services were involved in the plot. Another document showed the security forces estimated that, if a police special unit attempted to break into the parliament building, it might lead to \"between 80 and 110 deaths\".Among the documents were also messages of support from foreign governments once the coup had failed. A message in Spanish from Queen Elizabeth II to King Juan Carlos read: \"All of us in Great Britain are reassured to know the final result.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoHarry SekulichBBC News Getty ImagesHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says he has stationed soldiers at key energy facilities across the country after he blamed Ukraine for disrupting energy supplies.Orban has accused Kyiv of imposing an \"oil blockade\" on Hungary by deliberately delaying the reopening of the Druzhba pipeline, the main route for delivering Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia.Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia through the pipeline have been cut off since 27 January, with Kyiv saying it was closed after Russian strikes. Orban said the suspension of the critical oil flow was purely political and that Ukraine was \"preparing further actions\".Ukraine did not immediately respond to Orban's comments.Orban's critics say he has been stepping up the war of words with Ukraine in order to convince the public that Hungary is under attack in the run-up to elections in April. His ruling Fidesz party is trailing in most opinion polls, suggesting he could lose power after 16 years. The Hungarian leader, who is seen as Russia's closest partner in the EU, has vetoed a  €90bn (£78bn) EU loan to Ukraine and blocked the 20th package of sanctions on Moscow.Kyiv has repeatedly attacked Russian oil facilities, including the section of the Druzhba pipeline running through Russian territory, with a Ukrainian drone strike hitting an oil pumping station earlier this week.The attacks forced Russia's oil operator to reduce the amount of crude oil it takes into its system by about 250,000 barrels a day, according to Reuters.Ukraine has been dealing with acute power shortages due to sharply intensified Russian attacks on its power and gas networks.It has had to increase imports from Europe, some of which come from Hungary and Slovakia. Both countries have threatened to halt emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine until the oil pipeline has been reopened.Earlier this week, Hungary vetoed a vital €90bn European Union loan (£78bn) to Ukraine, citing anger over the Druzhba pipeline dispute.An EU spokesperson told AFP on Wednesday that Hungary and Slovakia do not currently run the risk of a shortage of oil despite the interruption of Russian deliveries from the pipeline, as alternative sources are supplying both countries. \"Croatia confirmed at the meeting that non-Russian crude oil is being transported through the Adria pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia,\" European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said after experts met to discuss the situation. \"It remains the main alternative pipeline for Hungary and Slovakia to cover their needs, and the pipeline has sufficient capacity to increase volumes to fully cover the Hungarian Slovakian requirements,\" she said. Following a meeting of the Hungarian Defence Council on Wednesday, Orban uploaded a video on social media announcing measures that he said were to protect the country's critical energy infrastructure.Soldiers have been deployed to energy stations, police will patrol power stations, and drones are banned in Hungary's north-east border region with Ukraine, the Hungarian PM announced. \"The Ukrainian government is exerting pressure on the Hungarian and Slovak governments through an oil blockade,\" he said, adding that \"they are preparing further actions to disrupt Hungary's energy system\".Zelensky did not immediately respond to the accusation, and there was no indication that Ukraine was planning such an attack.

    "body": "13 hours agoFiona Nimoni,in LondonandIone Wells,in São Paulo, BrazilAPMarielle Franco was 38 years old when she was shot dead Brazil's Supreme Court has voted to convict two politicians of ordering the murder of the prominent Rio de Janeiro councillor and activist, Marielle Franco. Brothers Domingos Inácio Brazão and João Francisco Inácio Brazão were sentenced to more than 76 years each for masterminding the drive-by shooting that killed Franco alongside her driver Anderson Gomes in 2018. Franco, a gay black woman, was an emerging figure in Brazil's socialist party, with her death at the age of 38 sparking nationwide protests.Four justices concluded unanimously that the Brazão brothers targeted Franco because she was considered a threat to their interests.Franco had worked with Rio de Janeiro's city council to oppose housing developments in poorer neighbourhoods that were a source of income for militia groups.The case exposed links between politicians and organised crime.The brothers \"didn't just have contact with the militia. They were the militia,\" Judge Alexandre de Moraes said.The only woman on the Supreme Court, Carmen Lucia, said the process had caused her \"great spiritual and psychological harm\", asking how many more \"Marielles will Brazil allow to be murdered?\"In a post on Instagram, Franco's sister Anielle Franco - who serves as minister for racial equality - paid tribute to Brazil's judicial system, saying it had \"honoured the memory of Marielle and Anderson\". She added: \"It has been eight years of struggle to find out who ordered Marielle's murder and why. Eight years of fighting for full justice. \"Brazil begins a new historic chapter in confronting political violence based on gender and race. Impunity cannot be part of our democracy.\"In 2024, two former police officers were jailed in 2024 over Marielle's murder. Ronnie Lessa confessed to firing the shots and was sentenced to 78 years and nine months, while Élcio de Queiroz received 59 years and eight months for being behind the wheel.The Brazao brothers were arrested in 2024 after Lessa named them as the masterminds behind the murders as part of a plea deal with prosecutors.Getty ImagesAnielle Franco, pictured with her father and mother, was in the Supreme Court on Wednesday to hear the verdict ",

The chart-topping band has been locked in a bitter feud with its label Ador, a Hybe subsidiary, since it sacked Min as the label's CEO in August 2024.NewJeans, who saw Min as a mentor, announced they would leave the agency following her dismissal, but a South Korea district court ruled last October that they must honour their contract with Ador, which runs until 2029.In a separate ruling earlier this month, the court sided with Min in a put option dispute with Hybe, ordering the entertainment giant to pay her 25.6bn won.A put option is a contract that gives its owner the right to sell an asset at a future date at a predetermined price.Hybe has appealed against the ruling.\"I'm here because there are values I desperately want more than a large sum of money,\" Min said on Wednesday, noting that NewJeans was the main reason behind her decision to give up the payout.Min has called for the withdrawal of all ongoing civil and criminal lawsuits against NewJeans members, as well as external partners, former Ador employees, and fans who have been drawn into the conflict.\"Only then will the artistes, their families, and their fans be free from further unnecessary noise,\" she said.Hybe has yet to respond to her offer.NewJeans, who became the eighth biggest-selling act in the world a year after their debut in 2022, were seen as a game-changer by critics for their blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies. Their dramatic row with Hybe has rocked the K-pop world. Fans around the world have taken to social media urging the agency to \"free NewJeans\".\"It's not fair at all. Free NewJeans [all 5 members],\" a fan wrote on Instagram after Marsh's termination last year. \"All they wanted to do was to be [artists] and make their fans happy.\"Min's statement on Wednesday echoed these sentiments. She concluded it by addressing Hybe's chairman Bang Si-hyuk: \"Let us now meet not in the courtroom, but in the space of creation\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoGavin ButlerandJake Kwon,Seoul CorrespondentAFP PHOTO/KCNA VIA KNSKim Jong Un's comments came during North Korea's five-yearly party congress in PyongyangKim Jong Un has declared his intent to expand North Korea's nuclear arsenal and operational range - calling on the United States to respect his country's nuclear power, in a rare message to Washington.The United States and North Korea could \"get along\", Kim added, but only if the US accepts that North Korea's nuclear weapons are here to stay.His comments, which were made at a five-yearly party congress held in the capital Pyongyang, are seen as leaving a door open to talks with US President Donald Trump ahead of Trump's visit to China in April.However, Kim dashes hopes of any diplomatic thaw with South Korea, calling them the North's \"most hostile entity\". If Washington \"respects our present [nuclear] position as stipulated in the Constitution... and withdraws its hostile policy... there is no reason why we cannot get along well with the United States,\" Kim said at the Ninth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, according to state media outlet KCNA.The future state of US-North Korea relations \"depends entirely on the US attitude\", Kim said.\"Whether it's peaceful coexistence or permanent confrontation, we are ready for either, and the choice is not ours to make.\"He also addressed its neighbour South Korea, saying that it would \"permanently exclude Seoul from the category of compatriots\", adding that \"as long as South Korea cannot escape the geopolitical conditions of having a border with us, the only way to live safely is to give up everything related to us and leave us alone\".One analyst told AFP that Pyongyang's latest remarks signalled \"an intention to pursue relations with the US independently, without going through South Korea.\"Kim also highlighted Pyongyang's nuclear programme, saying: \"We will focus on projects to increase the number of nuclear weapons and expand nuclear operational means.\"Despite long-standing international sanctions, North Korea has continued to build its nuclear capabilities, regularly testing banned intercontinental missiles.State-run KCNA said this week that under Kim's leadership North Korea \"radically improved\" its \"war deterrence\", \"with the nuclear forces as its pivot\".The secrecy of the regime, however, makes it difficult to evaluate how much progress its military has actually made.Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), an independent think tank, estimated last year that North Korea had around 50 assembled nuclear warheads and enough fissile material to produce up to 40 more.Kim also previously called for a \"limitless\" expansion of the country's nuclear programme in November 2024.Last year, US President Trump released a global security road map that conspicuously did not mention the denuclearisation of North Korea as a goal - despite that being a constant in the National Security Strategy of every US president since 2003, when Pyongyang's nuclear programme emerged.The omission fuelled speculation that talks between Trump and Kim, last held in 2019, could soon be revived.Trump's previous road map, issued during his first term in 2017, mentioned North Korea 16 times - describing it as a threat and a rogue state that could \"use a nuclear weapon against the United States\".Kim, however, has long insisted that denuclearisation is not something Pyongyang is considering.\"The concept of 'denuclearisation' has already lost its meaning. We have become a nuclear state,\" he told parliament in September. \"I say 'denuclearisation' is the last, last thing to expect from us.\"\"If the United States, freeing itself from its absurd pursuit of others' denuclearisation and recognising the reality, wants genuine peaceful coexistence with us, there is no reason for us not to come face to face with it.\"ReutersKim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, was photographed alongside him at the party congressPhotos from the closing stages of this year's party congress also showed Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, standing alongside her father in a matching black leather jacket at a military parade in Pyongyang.Earlier this month South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers Kim had selected Ju Ae - who is believed to be 13 - as his heir.The National Intelligence Service said it would would keep close tabs on whether she attended the party congress.",

    "body": "Pope Leo to visit four African countries in April14 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéAFP via Getty ImagesPope Leo visited Africa several times before he became the leader of the Catholic ChurchPope Leo XIV will begin a 10-day visit to four African countries on 13 April, marking his first pastoral trip to the continent, the Vatican has announced.He will travel to Algeria, Cameroon, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea.In Cameroon, the Pope will visit the capital Yaoundé, the economic hub Douala, and the Anglophone city of Bamenda in the restive Northwest region, where an armed conflict has been raging for nearly 10 years.This is the first time that a pope will visit Algeria, whose population is mostly Muslim.In December, he expressed his desire to visit the continent, citing Algeria, the birthplace of St Augustine of Hippo, as a potential destination. The pontiff belongs to the Augustinian religious order and had previously called for interfaith dialogue in the North African country.While it will be the Pope's first pastoral visit to Africa since assuming the leadership of the Catholic Church, he is no stranger to the continent. As Cardinal Robert Prevost, he visited several countries including Kenya and Tanzania. His decision to travel to the continent highlights Africa's growing importance to the church - it is home to about 20% of the world's Catholics.In January, Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, Archbishop of Kinshasa and President of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar hinted at the Pope's plans to visit Africa in April.\"When the Pope visits a country, especially countries in crisis like ours, it is also to give hope to the people, especially people who are suffering,\" the cardinal said in an interview with Vatican News after meeting the pontiff.The Pope's visit to Africa follows his first foreign trip to Turkey and Lebanon late last year, where he called for peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.The last papal trip to Africa took place in February 2023, when Leo's predecessor, Pope Francis, visited the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.The official programme of the Pope's activities during his tour is yet to be released.However, Vatican News reports that the tour from April 13 to 23, will include stops in Algiers and Annaba in Algeria; Yaoundé, Bamenda and Douala in Cameroon; Luanda, Muxima and Saurimo in Angola; and Malabo, Mongomo and Bata in Equatorial Guinea, the continent's only Spanish‑speaking nation.Additional reporting by Jean OtalorMore about Pope Leo XIV from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Cuba says it shot dead four people on US-registered speedboat20 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporterandMax MatzaWatch: \"I'm not going to speculate\", says Marco Rubio on Cuba boat shootingFour people shot dead by Cuban border guards in a US-registered speedboat were Cuban nationals living in the United States, Cuba's government said. In a statement posted online, Cuba's interior ministry said that the speedboat's passengers - the four who were killed and six others who were wounded, also Cuban citizens - opened fire on a coast guard vessel that approached them near an island off the country's northern coast on Wednesday.The 10 individuals, some with previous criminal records, were armed and intended to \"carry out an infiltration for terrorist purposes\", the statement said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was also investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident.The incident comes amid increased tensions between the US and Cuba, which is facing a deepening fuel crisis that has been worsened by the US blocking oil shipments from Venezuela.Cuban authorities said the speedboat had entered its territorial waters. The island nation's interior ministry identified the six surviving passengers, who have since been detained, and one passenger who was killed. They added that most of them \"have prior records involving criminal and violent activity\". Handguns, assault rifles and improvised explosive devices were recovered on the speedboat, according to the statement, along with other tactical gear.The interior ministry also identified an eleventh person they said had been arrested and had confessed to being part of the alleged plot.In an earlier statement posted on X, the ministry said the Florida-registered vessel - with the registration number FL7726SH - was detected near Cayo Falcones, in the country's central Villa Clara province on Wednesday morning. When a Cuban boat carrying five members of the ministry's border guard approached the vessel for identification, \"the crew of the violating speedboat opened fire\" and wounded the Cuban commander, the statement said.\"As a consequence of the confrontation, as of the time of this report, four aggressors on the foreign vessel were killed and six injured.\"Those injured were evacuated and given medical assistance, the statement added. Before the Cuban government released some of the passengers' identities, Rubio confirmed the boat was not carrying US government personnel and that an investigation was ongoing to \"clarify\" the event and what the passengers were doing in the area. Rubio spoke from Saint Kitts and Nevis, where he had travelled to meet Caribbean leaders amid the Trump administration's push to ramp up pressure on Cuba's government, as well as other regional issues. \"We're going to find out exactly what happened, who was involved, and we'll make a determination on the basis of what we find out,\" he told reporters.He vowed that US investigators would move \"quickly\" to gather the key facts, and that the US Coast Guard had travelled to the \"vicinity\" of the attack.But he added that the US would not rely on information provided by the Cuban government, and that Washington would independently verify the facts of the case.  \"It is highly unusual to see shootouts on the open sea like that. It's not something that happens every day,\" Rubio said.The US-Cuba relationship has grown increasingly tense following the seizure by American forces of Venezuela's leader Nicolás Maduro on 3 January. Venezuela has been a long-standing ally of Cuba, but in recent weeks the US has effectively stopped it from shipping oil to the Caribbean nation, and threatened tariffs on other nations if they do so.  Trump has urged Cuba to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences.The first Cuban interior ministry statement alluded to these tensions, saying that \"in the face of current challenges, Cuba reaffirms its determination to protect it territorial waters\" and safeguard its sovereignty. On Wednesday, the US Treasury said it would ease some small private sector transactions, including oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people, for commercial and humanitarian use\".The incident also happened one day after Cuban-American groups in Miami commemorated the 30th anniversary of the Brothers to the Rescue shootdown, which killed four people.Wednesday's incident sparked Florida lawmakers and state to call for an investigation and to criticise the Cuban government.Florida Congressman Carlos Giménez, a Cuban-American former mayor of Miami, said he would demand an investigation into what he called a \"massacre\".James Uthmeier, Florida's attorney general, said he would direct local law enforcement to investigate the incident. \"The Cuban government cannot be trusted, and we will do everything in our power to hold these communists accountable,\" he said. In the US Senate, Florida Republican Rick Scott demanded \"a full investigation into this deeply concerning situation and to determine what happened.\" \"The Communist Cuban regime must be held accountable!\" he added.",

    "body": "10 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanNew YorkZohran Mamdani responds after NYPD officers hit during snowball fightWhat started as an innocent snowball fight during the New York City blizzard has, in fact, snowballed, landing Mayor Zohran Mamdani and the city's police leadership in a row. Video taken Monday afternoon in Washington Square Park shows a snowball fight following an epic snowstorm devolving into some parkgoers apparently targeting police with snowballs.Mamdani said afterwards that those involved shouldn't face charges, instead urging New Yorkers to treat officers with respect. But his response has him at odds with police leaders, who called his statements \"disgraceful\".On Tuesday, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) released photos of four people they say assaulted officers with snowballs, injuring them.Getty ImagesDozens of people gathered for a pre-planned snowball fight in Washington Square Park on Monday. A confrontation erupted after police arrived\"I want to be very clear,\" Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch wrote on social media the day of the fight. \"The behavior depicted is disgraceful, and it is criminal.\"Viral clips of the snowball fight have made the rounds on TikTok and X in the days since a storm dumped nearly 20 inches of snow on the city. Washington Square Park in Manhattan's Greenwich Village often hosts large crowds for snow-day activities and snowball fights, including another one just weeks ago during the city's last big storm. But the tone of Monday's snowball fight changed. After NYPD officers arrived in response to 911 calls, video shows people yelling profanities and throwing snowballs as officers walk back to their vans. The police department is now seeking four men who they describe as approximately aged 18 to 20. Getty ImagesThe NYPD released four images of men they say were involved in assaulting police officersAn NYPD spokesperson said they \"intentionally struck the police officers multiple times with snow and ice in the head, neck, and face causing injuries\". The officers were taken to the hospital and are in stable condition. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Mamdani said he saw video of the incident and doesn't think there should be charges. \"From the videos that I 've seen, it looked like kids at a snowball fight,\" Mamdani said. In a post on social media later, the mayor encouraged residents to respect officers and other city employees.\"Officers, like all city workers, have been out in a historic blizzard, keeping New Yorkers safe and cars moving. Treat them with respect,\" he said. \"If anyone's catching a snowball, it's me.\" Mamdani on Wednesday said again that what he saw \"was a snowball fight\", acknowledging that it \"got out of hand, but that's what it was\".The mayor jokingly encouraged city school kids to throw snowballs at him for re-opening school after the blizzard. But for some critics, his attempt to lighten the mood hasn't worked.\"The mayor's response is a complete failure of leadership. This was not just a 'snowball fight.' This was an assault — by adults throwing chunks of ice and rocks — that landed two police officers in the hospital with head and face injuries,\" Police Benevolent Association (PBA) President Patrick Hendry said in a statement on Tuesday.\"The mayor has sent a disgraceful message to every police officer who serves this city, and a dangerous message to every person who might be looking to attack a police officer in the future.\"The Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA) agreed: \"Today it is snowballs. Tomorrow it could be rocks, bottles, or worse,\" said union President Vincent Vallelong.It's the unions' first major row with the mayor who, before taking office, apologised for previous comments calling the NYPD \"racist\" and \"a threat to public safety\". During his run for mayor, his opponents repeatedly characterised him as unfriendly to police and weak on public safety. Once elected in November, Mamdani asked Tisch, an appointee of former Mayor Eric Adams, to continue serving. Retaining Tisch, largely popular with moderates and business leaders, was viewed by some as Mamdani's way to allay concerns he would be soft on crime. Tension between mayors and the police union is not a new phenomenon, said Basil Smikle, a political strategist and former executive director of the state Democratic Party, especially when those mayors have a history of advocating for criminal justice reform. \"The mayor is trying to walk a fine line between not giving into narratives about young people of colour in this city, which is important,\" he said, but added, \"The police officers themselves and the PBA are always going to be sensitive to the mayor not standing up for police.\" For example, former New York mayor Bill de Blasio's relationship with police unions became hostile after he called out racial disparities in policing, Smikle said. The then-president of the PBA accused de Blasio of having \"blood\" on his hands after two officers were shot and killed during his tenure.Mamdani's previous rhetoric puts any comments he makes about the police under a microscope, said Smikle. \"Some may look at this incident as being somewhat playful, but it's hard to dissociate what could very easily be construed as animosity toward the police,\" he said. \"He will always be viewed through those prior statements.\" ",

    "body": "17 hours agoShingai NyokaHarareGetty ImagesThe US funding would have gone towards supporting programmes for HIV/Aids treatment and prevention, tuberculosis and malariaZimbabwe has rejected a US health deal that would have provided $367m (£272m) in funding over five years because of Washington's demand for sensitive data.The decision has come to light after a government memo from December was leaked, revealing that President Emmerson Mnangagwa felt the deal was \"lopsided\".A government spokesman has since explained the US was demanding access to biological samples for research and commercial gain but said it was not willing to share the benefits for future vaccines and treatments.\"We will now turn to the difficult and regrettable task of winding down our health assistance in Zimbabwe,\" US ambassador to Zimbabwe Pamela Tremont said in a statement.Her embassy said the US had provided more than $1.9bn in health funding to Zimbabwe over the last two decades.A doctors' association in Zimbabwe has called for further dialogue to find a deal acceptable to both sides so the country's HIV programme can continue.The agency had administered aid for the US government, but Trump argued its spending was \"wasteful\" and his administration was pursing government-to-government deals to boost transparency and accountability.It said the money for Zimbabwe would have gone towards \"HIV/Aids treatment and prevention, tuberculosis, malaria, maternal and child health, and disease outbreak preparedness\".\"We believe this collaboration would have delivered extraordinary benefits for Zimbabwean communities especially the 1.2 million men, women and children currently receiving HIV treatment through US-supported programmes,\" Tremont said.But government spokesperson Nick Mangwana said the arrangement was \"asymmetrical\".\"Zimbabwe was being asked to share its biological resources and data over an extended period, with no corresponding guarantee of access to any medical innovations - such as vaccines, diagnostics, or treatments - that might result from that shared data,\" his statement said.\"In essence, our nation would provide the raw materials for scientific discovery without any assurance that the end products would be accessible to our people should a future health crisis emerge.\"He also said the US's withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) and its pursuit of bilateral health agreements were upending structures already set up through the global health agency.Mangwana gave as an example its Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing scheme to deal with future pandemics.\"This system is designed to ensure that when a country contributes its data, the benefits - including vaccines and treatments - are shared equitably, not commercialised exclusively by those with the resources to develop them.\"Zimbabwe's reservations over the US deal \"should not be misconstrued as anti-American sentiment\", he added.\"We welcome continued dialogue with our American counterparts on how future co-operation might be structured in a manner that respects the sovereignty and dignity of both nations.\"The Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians (ZCPHP) said it understood the government's concerns, but suggested negotiations should continue given that much of the country's HIV programmes relied on external financing.\"Where technical issues exist, including those relating to data governance or implementation frameworks, these can often be addressed through technical clarification and negotiated safeguards,\" it said.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "8 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemReutersThe last round of indirect talks took place at the Omani ambassador's residence in Geneva on 17 FebruaryUS and Iranian officials are due to meet in Geneva on Thursday for a third round of indirect talks, as President Donald Trump threatens to strike Iran if a nuclear deal is not reached.The discussions come amid the largest US military build-up in the Middle East since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and with Iran vowing to respond to an attack with force.The talks are seen as a last-ditch effort to prevent a conflict, but the chances of an agreement remain unclear.While Trump has said he prefers to solve the crisis through diplomacy, he has also said he is considering a limited strike on Iran to pressure its leaders to accept a deal.The president, however, has done little to explain what he is demanding in the negotiations and why there could be the need to take military action now, eight months after the US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities during a war between Israel and Iran.Iran has rejected the US demand to stop the enrichment of uranium in its territory, but there have been indications that it is prepared to offer some concessions about its nuclear programme.As in the previous two rounds of discussions, which were mediated by Oman earlier this month, the Iranian delegation will be led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, while the US will be represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.In recent weeks, the US has sent thousands of troops and what Trump has described as an \"armada\" to the region, including two aircraft carriers along with other warships, as well as fighter jets and refuelling aircraft.Trump first threatened to bomb Iran last month as security forces brutally repressed anti-government protests, killing thousands of people. But since then, his focus has turned to Iran's nuclear programme, which has been at the centre of a long-running dispute with the West.For decades, the US and Israel have accused Iran of trying to secretly develop a nuclear weapon. Iran insists its programme is only for peaceful purposes, though the country is the only non-nuclear-armed state to have enriched uranium at near weapons-grade level.Oman Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Handout via REUTERSOmani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi (R) has called on both sides to \"go the extra mile towards finalising the deal\"In his State of the Union speech to Congress on Tuesday, Trump briefly and vaguely talked about the tensions with Iran, without clearly laying out the case for strikes.He said Iran was working to build missiles that would \"soon\" be capable of reaching the US, without giving details. He also accused the country of trying to \"start all over again\" with a nuclear weapons programme following last year's strikes, and said he could not allow the \"world's number one sponsor of terror... to have a nuclear weapon\".The US struck three nuclear sites in Iran last June, as it joined Israel in its bombing campaign. At the time, Trump said the facilities had been \"obliterated\". Iran says its enrichment activity stopped after the attacks, although it has not allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspectors to access the damaged sites.\"They want to make a deal,\" Trump said, \"but we haven't heard those secret words: 'We will never have a nuclear weapon'.\"Hours before the speech, however, the Iranian foreign minister posted on social media that Iran would \"under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon\". Araghchi also said there was an \"historic opportunity to strike an unprecedented agreement that addresses mutual concerns and achieves mutual interests\".Reacting to Trump's address, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman accused the US of repeating \"big lies\" regarding its nuclear programme, ballistic missiles and the number of protesters killed in the crackdown.ReutersForeign Minister Abbas Araghchi says Iran \"will under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon\"Iran's proposals have not been made public, but the discussions in Geneva could include the creation of a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, which has been raised in previous negotiations, as well as ideas about what to do with Iran's roughly 400kg (880lb) stockpile of highly enriched uranium. In return, Iran expects the lifting of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Opponents of the regime say any relief would give the clerical rulers a lifeline.But it remains unclear which conditions Trump could find acceptable for a deal. Iran has already rejected discussing limits to the country's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for proxies in the region - an alliance Tehran calls the \"Axis of Resistance\" that includes Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, militias in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen.Reports in US media, quoting unnamed administration officials, have suggested that Trump was considering an initial strike in the coming days on Iran's Revolutionary Guards or nuclear sites to pressure the country's leaders. If negotiations failed, according to the reports, the president might go as far as ordering a campaign with the aim of toppling the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is also said to have warned that strikes against Iran could be risky, potentially drawing the US into a prolonged conflict, although Trump has insisted that Gen Dan Caine believes it would be \"easily won\".Iran, meanwhile, has threatened to respond to any attack by striking American military assets in the Middle East and Israel.EPAPresident Donald Trump hit out at reports his top military adviser had urged caution on strikes against IranUS-allied countries in the region are concerned that an attack on Iran could lead to a wider conflict, and have warned that air power alone will not be able to change the country's leadership.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has warned against a deal that does not include Iran's ballistic missiles and its proxies. Netanyahu has long described Iran as a key threat for Israel, and a source of instability in the region. Analysts believe that the prime minister, who visited the White House earlier this month, may be pushing for a campaign with the goal of toppling the Iranian regime.The US has the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal. Israel is also believed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies this.Ahead of the State of the Union, Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered a classified briefing to the so-called \"gang of eight\", composed of the leaders of both parties in the Senate and House of Representatives and the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees of both chambers.Following the briefing, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, gave a brief statement, saying: \"This is serious, and the administration has to make its case to the American people.\"",

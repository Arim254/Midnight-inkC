    "body": "8 hours agoChiamaka DikeBBC Africa, Makoko, LagosGift Ufuoma/BBCA mother of five, Anna Sobie's wooden home is one of many that has been demolished in a shanty town in a lagoon in Lagos, with critics describing it as a \"land-grab\" by the authorities to gentrify the prime waterfront spot in Nigeria's biggest city.Lagos State government officials deny the allegation, saying they are demolishing parts of Makoko - the country's biggest informal waterfront settlement - because it is expanding near high voltage power lines, posing a major health and safety risk.Sobie and her children now sleep on the narrow broken platform where their house stood until a few weeks ago on Lagos Lagoon. This is the biggest of 10 lagoons in a mega-city that is facing an acute housing crisis - and where life is becoming increasingly expensive, pushing more people to the margins of society. As Sobie spoke to the BBC, canoes - steered with paddles or long bamboo poles - moved through the narrow waterways, carrying mattresses and sacks of clothes belonging to the displaced people.Residents say the demolitions began two days before Christmas, when excavation teams accompanied by armed police moved into sections of the waterfront settlement facing the Atlantic Ocean.In a joint statement last month, 10 non-governmental organisations said that \"armed thugs, security personnel and demolition teams with bulldozers descended repeatedly on the community\" to tear down homes, and burn them.\"Homes were set on fire with little or no notice, in some cases while residents were still [inside],\" the NGOs added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCAnna Sobie's family are living on the the ruins of their houseWhen the BBC visited Makoko, smoke, from the rubble of torched homes or from fires that people had lit, burning damp wood to dry their clothes, was hanging in the air.Excavators were at work along the shoreline - houses built on wooden stilts over the lagoon were still being pulled down, their planks collapsing into the water below.  Corrugated metal sheets were falling from roofs and drifting between boats. Makoko was founded in the 19th Century by fishing communities who have lived in the settlement ever since, along with other low-income families and migrants who come to Lagos in search of better opportunities. Ownership of the lagoon is fiercely contested. The state government claims ownership of it under federal law, saying Makoko has been built without planning permission or occupancy rights. Older residents dispute this, saying the settlement predates modern Lagos, and they have what they call a customary right to it.Estimates of Makoko's population vary, from 80,000 to 200,000, but much of the settlement now lies in fragments.The NGOs said that more than 10,000 people have been displaced after the destruction of more than 3,000 homes, as well as schools, clinics and churches. The state government has not given any figures of the buildings demolished.Sobie's home was among those that have been destroyed. \"I was inside when it started,\" she says. \"The noise was very loud. When we came out, we saw the excavator.\"She says there was little time to move her family's belongings. Her son Solomon's school in Makoko was demolished the same day. Sobie's family moved briefly into a building nearby. That, too, was later pulled down. \"We're sleeping in an open space under the rain, and they're currently setting properties ablaze,\" Sobie says, adding:  \"We don't have another place.\" Like many other children, Solomon no longer goes to school. He now helps his mother gather firewood from collapsed houses, pulling loose planks from the debris to sell.Even as the excavators work, canoe-borne business activities continue, with traders peddling their way between the remaining homes to sell fish and goods. But many other traders can no longer do business, as they lost their goods when their homes were demolished or torched.With the lagoon central to their lives, they have protested against the move to force them out of Makoko. Gift Ufuoma/BBCThe state government says it will give financial compensation to families whose homes have been destroyedMore than 1,000 angry residents marched last week to the state legislature, the House of Assembly, demanding an audience with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, whose offices are nearby.But police responded by firing tear gas, with protesters saying that at least one person was injured in the ensuing chaos.Community leaders and residents say that tear gas was also fired during the demolitions a few weeks ago, causing the death of five people, including children. \"Children were weeping, some died, some were unconscious, and were taken to the hospital as a result of the tear gas,\" Sobie tells the BBC.The Lagos State government says it is unaware of their personnel using tear gas or of deaths linked to the demolitions. Speaking to the BBC, the state's commissioner for information, Gbenga Omotoso, says that any such claims would be investigated.\"We would determine the actual cause of death,\" he says. \"Our personnel will not knowingly kill anybody.\"The state government has defended the demolitions, saying they are targeting homes built beneath high voltage power lines.\"No responsible government anywhere in the world can allow people to live directly under high-tension cables or obstruct vital waterways,\" the governor's special adviser on urban development, Olajide Abiodun Babatunde, said in a statement. Governor Sanwo-Olu said that affected families would be provided with financial grants and other assistance, and it was wrong to accuse him of \"destroying\" Makoko. He raised concern that shanties were \"sprawling\" at an \"incredible speed\", getting closer to the Third Mainland Bridge, the longest and busiest of three bridges connecting the mainland to the islands - the commercial heart of the city and its wealthier neighbourhoods.For the governor this spells danger.\"So, what we have done is that we just pushed them back,\" he added.Gift Ufuoma/BBCSome residents suspect their homes have been demolished to pave the way for an upmarket development Lagos-based real estate developer Peacemaker Afolabi tells the BBC that demand for land in the city is huge.\"Everywhere in Lagos is prime land,\" he says. \"And waterfront is always prime.\" Some residents suspect that the demolitions are aimed at clearing the area for private developments, including luxury homes.This has been repeatedly denied by the state government, but suspicion remains.\"This is not the slow, decades-long gentrification often seen in Western cities. It's a rapid, almost violent reshaping that is already forcing millions of residents to the margins,\" he writes. \"In the next few years, Lagos may look more polished and globally appealing. But for many of its people, it will also become profoundly unliveable.\"In their joint statement, the NGOs said that demolitions in Makoko, and other settlements last year, were part of a \"sinister agenda to grab land\". \"These actions against thousands of peaceful, hardworking residents represent a deliberate pattern of state-enabled violence against the urban poor, carried out to clear valuable land for elite interests and private mega-developments,\" the NGOs said. \"The housing deficit has thus grown from approximately 2.95 million units in 2016 to 3.4 million in 2025, a 15 per cent increase,\" Nigeria's Punch newspaper quoted the report as saying.Rapid population growth, rising rents and limited access to formal housing have pushed many low-income residents into informal settlements, particularly along waterfronts and transport corridors.The authorities have demolished homes in Makoko in the past - most recently in 2017, when residents obtained a court order to prevent forced evictions without adequate notice, compensation and resettlement.Megan Chapman, co-director of the Justice and Empowerment Initiatives campaign group, says the government has failed to provide residents affected by the latest demolitions with alternative accommodation. \"They have to identify everyone who will be affected and make arrangements before homes are lost,\" she tells the BBC\"When people are removed like this, it affects livelihoods, family structures and how communities function over time.\"When the BBC was in Makoko, boys were sitting along the lagoon, repairing their broken fishing nets. Children moved between piles of debris, collecting firewood from collapsed structures. A tractor pulled away from what was once a house. Only a small number of buildings remained standing, including the homes of traditional leaders.Elizabeth Kakisiwe says she sleeps nearby.Each evening, she lays wooden boards on damp ground for her children and packs them away again in the morning.\"We were at the market when it started,\" she says. \"When I came back, my house was gone.\"She says there was no clear warning and no time to remove belongings. Clothes, cooking utensils and mattresses were lost. When rain fell days later, they were drenched.\"At night, we sit in the cold,\" she says. \"If the children feel sick, we give them paracetamol.\"Cooking has become difficult, she says, because rain has made the ground wet and rats move through the debris. \"Yesterday, we only drank garri,\" Kakisiwe says, referring to a popular cassava-based meal that is often made as a drink. \"There is nothing to cook.\"Expressing a similar view, Sobie says: \"The suffering is much. A lot of people have been dying. We just don't know what to say. It's only God that can help us.\"Additional reporting by Gift UfuomaMore BBC stories about housing in Lagos:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "'Superhuman' teen swims hours to save family stranded off Australian coast19 hours agoKerena CobbinaGetty ImagesThe family were stranded 4km off the coast in Geographe BayA 13-year-old boy has been praised for his determination after he swam through rough waters in fading light to save his mother and two siblings who had been swept out to sea off Australia's coast.The family had been paddleboarding and kayaking at Geographe Bay in the south of Western Australia, on Friday when strong winds pushed their inflatables off course, police said.The teenager began to paddle back to shore to raise the alarm but his kayak took on water - so he swam the remaining 4km (2 nautical miles).\"The bravery, strength and courage shown by this family were extraordinary, especially the young fella who swam 4km to raise the alarm,\" Naturaliste Volunteer Marine Rescue Group said.The organisation's commander Paul Bresland described the efforts of the teenager as \"superhuman\".\"He swam in, he reckons, the first two hours with a life jacket on,\" he told ABC News. \"The brave fella thought he's not going to make it with a life jacket on, so he ditched it, and he swam the next two hours without a life jacket.\"The boy was able to raise the alarm by 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Friday evening, sparking a huge search for the missing relatives from Quindalup beach, near Busselton, WA Police said in a statement on Monday.The boy's 47-year-old mother, her other son, 12, and daughter, eight, were located at around 20:30 by a rescue helicopter clinging to a paddleboard about 14km offshore. \"A volunteer marine rescue vessel was directed to their location and all three were successfully rescued and returned to shore,\" the force said.Insp James Bradley said the incident was an important reminder of how rapidly ocean conditions can change. \"Thankfully, all three people were wearing life jackets, which contributed to their survival,\" he told local media.\"The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough - his determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.\"The family were assessed by paramedics before being taken to a nearby hospital, police said.The family were later discharged and visited the marine rescue crew to say thank you, the ABC reported.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNardine SaadGetty ImagesA federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end  deportation protections for more than 350,000 Haitian immigrants, who are allowed to live and work in the US legally under Temporary Protected Status (TPS).A day before the TPS was set to lapse, US judge Ana Reyes said the Department of Homeland Security boss doesn't have the facts or law on her side.\"Plaintiffs charge that Secretary [Kristi] Noem preordained her termination decision and did so because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants. This seems substantially likely,\" Reyes wrote.The administration has argued that TPS schemes attract illegal immigration and have long been abused and extended by Democrats.TPS prevents US officials from deporting immigrants to countries deemed unsafe whether from natural disasters, armed conflicts or other crises.In a scathing 83-page ruling, Reyes denied the Trump administration's motion to have the lawsuit dismissed, granting the plaintiffs' request for the deportation protection to remain while the case makes its way through the courts. The plaintiffs in the case are five Haitian TPS holders.\"They are not, it emerges, 'killers, leeches, or entitlement junkies,'\" Reyes wrote, quoting missives by Noem. Haiti was designated as eligible for TPS after the Caribbean nation suffered a devastating earthquake in 2010. The status has been extended repeatedly, most recently in 2021 under the Biden administration. The Trump administration has argued that TPS for Haitians has transformed into permanent residency and has become incongruous with Congress' original intention in creating the program. The Trump administration has pushed for the dismantling of most TPS programmes, raising the possibility of deportation for hundreds of thousands of migrants in the US from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela, among others.Meanwhile, the administration has also moved to end deportation protections for around 2,500, Somalis. Starting 17 March, they will lose their work authorisations and legal status, making them eligible for deportation.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPeter HoskinsAFP via Getty ImagesChina has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.It comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.Under the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media. The new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle. Inside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.  Cars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.Hidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.They feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.Although the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.Tesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.In November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.The NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.In four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

    "body": "9 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesFederal immigration agents deployed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, will soon receive body cameras, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says.The announcement comes as the government faces a backlash over the deaths last month of two US citizens - Alex Pretti and Renee Good - following a surge of federal immigration officers into the Minneapolis area as part of an immigration crackdown.\"Effective immediately we are deploying body cameras to every officer in the field in Minneapolis,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X on Monday. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner has ruled Pretti's 24 January death a homicide. Homicide refers to the killing of a person by another person. It does not necessarily signify that a crime has occurred.Monday's report by the medical examiner said Pretti had suffered \"multiple gunshot wounds\" fired by one or more law enforcement officers.It added that he died in the emergency room at the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. No further details were noted.According to US Customs and Border Protection, the two agents involved in Pretti's death wore body cameras. They have been placed on leave, the agency said.The US Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into Pretti's death.Noem said once funding is available, the body camera programme will be expanded nationwide. The US is currently on day three of a partial government shutdown as Democrats continue to demand immigration reforms, including body cameras, as part of any funding deal to reopen the government.Immigration and Customs Enforcement is currently the highest funded US law enforcement agency, after Congress authorised $80bn (£59bn) for the agency last year.Asked about Noem's announcement, President Donald Trump said that body cameras \"generally tend to be good for law enforcement because people can't lie about what's happening\". \"Generally speaking, I think it's 80% good for law enforcement,\" he said. In the wake of Pretti's shooting, the Trump administration removed Gregory Bovino, the US border patrol chief, from Minneapolis and replaced him with border tsar Tom Homan. Last week Homan met local leaders, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Michael Frey, to discuss calming tensions in the wake of Pretti and Good's deaths. Walz and Frey have called for a withdrawal of federal agents entirely from the state's capital region.After his arrival, Homan said that authorities were working on a plan to \"draw down\" federal agents in Minneapolis, but that changes in the operation would depend on how much state and local officials co-operate with federal authorities. The administration has criticised Minneapolis for having a \"sanctuary city policy\" that bars city employees from enforcing immigration laws.Frey told the New York Times that he wants Minneapolis police officers \"doing the important work of keeping Minneapolis residents safe\". But he has said the city will work with federal authorities in certain situations.More than 3,000 federal immigration officers have been in the state of Minnesota for weeks as part of a federal immigration surge ordered by Trump, who campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration.",

He has campaigned for more autonomy for Tibet, but Beijing considers it an integral part of China.In a message on social media the Dalai Lama, who is also a Nobel peace laureate, said: \"I receive this recognition with gratitude and humility.\"I don't see it as something personal, but as a recognition of our shared universal responsibility.\"The award was collected on his behalf by musician Rufus Wainwright, who was among the artists to feature on the audiobook.Getty ImagesRufus Wainwright collected the award on behalf of the Tibetan spiritual leaderLast year the Dalai Lama confirmed plans to name a successor, which has caused further friction with China. According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after death - a process deeply rooted in spiritual customs, not political authority.He has previously said his reincarnation will take place in the \"free world\", meaning outside of atheist and communist China but Beijing swiftly rejected his authority to determine a successor.Chinese officials insist that any succession must follow Chinese laws, religious rituals and historical conventions - and ultimately be approved by the government in Beijing.The announcement has reignited fears among Tibetans in exile that China will attempt to name a successor to tighten control over Tibet, the region it occupied in 1950 and has ruled ever since.",

    "body": "20 hours agoTom BennettGetty ImagesThe South African comedian was hosting the music awardsUS President Donald Trump has threatened to sue comedian Trevor Noah after he joked about Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at the Grammy Awards.Hosting the event, Noah said: \"Song of the Year - that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein's island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton.\"Trump is known to have been an associate of Epstein for years, but says he had no knowledge of his crimes and that they fell out in about 2004. There are no suggestions he ever visited Epstein's private island and he has not been accused of any crime by Epstein's victims.  The US justice department has said allegations about him are unfounded and false.Trump responded to Noah's joke by saying he would be \"sending my lawyers to sue\". Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!!\"I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.\"Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.\"He added: \"Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!\"Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor.He had purchased his private island in 1998. Multiple survivors have alleged that they were trafficked there and abused. Trump has engaged in legal action with multiple media organisations in recent years, including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.In December, he filed a multi-billion dollar lawsuit in a Florida court accusing the BBC of defamation and of violating a trade practices law over the editing of a Panorama programme.Noah is a South African-born comedian who hosted The Daily Show on Comedy Central in the US for seven years.

    "body": "SpaceX to take over Elon Musk's AI firm7 hours agoKali Hays,Technology reporterandLily Jamali,North America Technology correspondentReutersElon Musk's SpaceX is taking over his artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, as the billionaire continues to unify some of his many business interests. SpaceX confirmed the deal to acquire xAI, a smaller firm known for its Grok chatbot, posting a memo from Musk about the merger on its website.In the note, Musk said the combination would form an \"innovation engine\" putting AI, rockets, space-based internet, and media under one roof. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, a source familiar said it valued xAI at $125bn (£91bn) and SpaceX at $1tn, making it the most valuable private company ever.Last month, Musk's electric car company, Tesla, also announced it had invested $2bn into xAI. Musk told Tesla investors at the time that he envisioned xAI functioning as an \"orchestra conductor\" for Tesla factories employing autonomous robots. At the same time, Musk also said Tesla would stop the manufacture of two car models in favour of producing robots - one of the most significant pivots the company has made.Tesla moved forward with the xAI investment despite objections from some shareholders, who had questioned the decision to divert resources to another Musk firm. In a vote last year, abstentions and votes against the idea outnumbered those who approved.SpaceX is also reported to be working on plans to list its shares for public trading.Emily Zheng, a senior analyst at Pitchbook, said the deal for xAI has all the markings of a company preparing for a public listing. \"The sheer cost of compute, infrastructure, and energy is why we are seeing many of venture's most valuable startups like SpaceX prepare to go public this year,\" Zheng said. \"Consolidating these companies ahead of an IPO allows SpaceX to present a differentiated, capital-efficient growth narrative to public investors.\"IPO stands for Initial Public Offering, and this is when a private company first sells its stock to the public on a stock exchange.In the SpaceX memo announcing the xAI merger, Musk said he thought space would provide the solution to the energy needs faced by AI firms. \"In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,\" he wrote.He said launching AI satellites from Earth would be the \"immediate focus\", but added that the deal would also help advance his bigger ambitions. \"The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe,\" he wrote.Neuralink and The Boring Company now appear to be the only two smaller Musk companies that have not been brought under one of his larger operations.xAI started out as a segment of X, formerly known as Twitter, after Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, using its access to real-time text and information as AI training data.By spring of 2025, xAI was independently incorporated and valued more highly by investors than X. The AI company acquired the social media platform in an all-stock deal, with Musk saying the merger would \"combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent\".xAI's main product is Grok, which has come under scrutiny several times over its AI image generation feature.In recent weeks, the European Commission and UK watchdog Ofcom both launched investigations into X over concerns Grok was used to create sexualised images. xAI said in January it had imposed restrictions on Grok users that limit image editing.",

    "body": "20 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesTsugaike Kogen Mountain Resort is a popular skiing destination in JapanAn Australian woman has died after becoming trapped in a ski lift at a resort in central Japan, officials have said.The 22-year-old woman had been using a chairlift at Tsugaike Mountain Resort in Otari, Nagano prefecture, when part of her backpack became caught in the lift mechanism, leaving her suspended in midair.The woman then suffered a heart attack and was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead, officials said.The Tsugaike Mountain Resort and Tsugaike Gondola Lift Co issued a joint apology and said an investigation had been launched into the incident, which occurred around 09:00 local time (0:00 GMT) on Friday. The resort's chief executive Tsuneo Kubo expressed his \"deepest condolences to the bereaved family\" and said safety measures would be strengthened.He said in a statement that an unfastened buckle on the woman's backpack had become hooked to the chair while the bag's chest strap was still fastened, causing her to be dragged along with it after trying to disembark.The lift was stopped by an attendant who pressed the emergency button, after which first aid was administered and the woman was transported to hospital by ambulance, Kubo added.The accident took place at the top of the two-person Tsuga No.2 Pair Lift. The woman had been riding the lift with another person, police told local media.The lift operator said it was co-operating with police and other authorities as the cause of the accident was investigated and safety procedures reviewed.\"We will take concrete measures to prevent recurrence,\" Kubo said. \"We take this situation very seriously and will strive to operate the ski resort in a safe manner so that our customers can use it with peace of mind.\"Police are questioning resort staff and inspecting the lift equipment as part of their inquiry, according to local media.Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that one of its citizens had died in Japan and said it was providing consular assistance to the family.\"We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time. Owing to our privacy obligations we are unable to provide further comment,\" a spokesperson said.Tsugaike Mountain Resort in Hakuba Valley is one of Nagano's largest ski areas, popular with both domestic and international visitors.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Why is no one being prosecuted over the Epstein files?Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, have agreed to testify in the congressional investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It comes days before a vote on whether to hold the couple in criminal contempt for refusing to appear before the House Oversight Committee after a months-long standoff.  Bill Clinton was acquainted with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, but has denied knowledge of his sex offending and says he cut off contact two decades ago. It's unclear when the depositions will take place, but it will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.The House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans, approved the measure to hold the Clintons in contempt late last month, with the support of several Democrats.On Monday evening, Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña posted on X confirming the couple would appear before the panel.\"They negotiated in good faith,\" Ureña wrote in a tweet directed at the House Oversight Committee. \"You did not. \"They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"Both Clintons say they previously provided the committee with sworn statements and have already provided the \"limited information\" they had on Epstein.The couple had dismissed the legal summonses as \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.US Department of JusticeBill Clinton in a hot tub, in the Epstein filesEpstein's private jet logs show that Clinton took four international flights in 2002 and 2003.The former president also appears at the late financier's estate in photos that were among a batch of records released by the justice department to comply with a law passed by Congress mandating the disclosure of all investigative material relating to the late convicted paedophile.One picture shows the former president swimming in a pool, and another shows him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Ureña, Clinton's spokesman, said at the time the photos were released in December that they were decades old and Clinton had stopped associating with Epstein before his crimes came to light.Watch: What's in the latest batch of released Epstein files?The Clintons wrote a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer last month criticising his handling of the Epstein investigation. \"The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government's role,\" the letter said. They added: \"There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics.\"Comer previously noted the subpoenas to the Clintons were approved in a bipartisan vote and said \"no-one is above the law\".\"We communicated with President Clinton's legal team for months now, giving them opportunity after opportunity to come in, to give us a day, and they continue to delay, delay, delay,\" said the Kentucky Republican.",

    "body": "Ukraine hails 'real results' after Musk restricts Russian Starlink use17 hours agoLaura GozziReutersElon Musk's efforts to stop Russia from using Starlink satellites for drone attacks have \"delivered real results\", a Ukrainian official said.Praising the SpaceX founder as \"a true champion of freedom and a true friend of the Ukrainian people\", defence minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Musk had swiftly responded when he was told Russian drones with Starlink connectivity were operating in the country.\"Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorised use of Starlink by Russia have worked,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Let us know if more needs to be done.\"The Russian drones are difficult to shoot down, Fedorov said, as they fly at low altitudes, cannot be countered with electronic warfare, and are controlled by operators in real time from a distance.The Institute for the Study of War warned in mid-January that since Russia had begun equipping the cheap kamikaze Molniya-2 drones with Starlink, their battlefield efficiency had increased \"dramatically\".While neither Fedorov nor Musk elaborated on what the response had been, the defence ministry's official website ArmiyaInform reported that SpaceX had introduced a speed limit of 75kph on Starlink terminals moving over Ukraine.\"Russian drones move much more quickly, so the enemy operators will not be able to control them in real time,\" the website said.Telegram/Serhiy BeskrestnovEarlier in January Serhiy Beskrestnov, an adviser to Mykhailo Fedorov, said a Starlink terminal had been found on a BM-35 kamikaze droneOn Monday Fedorov said the Ukrainian government was also preparing to implement a white list of approved Starlink satellite terminals which could operate in Ukraine. All unregistered terminals will be disconnected, Fedorov said.\"We are implementing this in cooperation with SpaceX,\" Fedorov stated, adding that instructions on registering the terminals would be forthcoming.Russian war bloggers warned the implications could go beyond drones, as the Russian military uses Starlink to provide the front line with internet.Fedorov - then deputy prime minister - asked for Musk's help soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. By the end of the day Musk said Starlink had been enabled in Ukraine and promised more satellite dishes.But shortly after supplying Ukraine with Starlink, Musk's relationship with Kyiv became turbulent. Later in 2022 he denied the Ukrainian military access to Starlink in Crimea, where Russia has been stationing military equipment since illegally annexing in 2014.At the time, Musk justified the decision by saying that Ukraine would have used Starlink access to \"sink most of the Russian fleet\", making SpaceX \"complicit in a major act of war\".Musk has since repeatedly criticised Western countries for providing Ukraine with funding and weaponry. \"It is insane to keep sending so much money to Ukraine with no accountability and no end game,\" he said.However, he has also stated that \"no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals.\"\"My Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off,\" Musk said in March.Despite these tensions, Fedorov last week again praised Musk's timely decision to provide his country with access at the start of the full-scale invasion, saying Starlink had been \"critically important for the stability of our state\".The 35-year-old former digital transformation minister was appointed to head the ministry of defence by President Volodymyr Zelensky last month.Fedorov favours a data-driven strategy and advanced cyber-warfare. He has also vowed to work closely with Silicon Valley companies, arguing that integrating partners would make Ukraine's defence system stronger.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring",

    "body": "21 hours agoMadina MaishanuBBC Africa, AbujaBBCThe chairs strewn across the floor of one of the churches raided last month hints at the panic the attack caused Dozens of worshippers kidnapped by gunmen in Nigeria's northern Kaduna state have returned home weeks after their abduction, police have confirmed.They were among 177 people seized last month from three churches in the remote village of Kurmin Wali.The 80 people escaped on the day they were taken but hid in neighbouring villages for a fortnight \"due to fear of being captured again\", state police spokesman Mansur Hassan told the BBC.The authorities say efforts are ongoing to secure the release of the remaining 86 people still being held. The attack was part of a wave of kidnappings for ransom affecting many parts of Nigeria, but no group has said it was behind the abductions.The raid was initially denied by police, who only confirmed the kidnappings on 21 January after local residents had reported to the BBC that 177 worshippers were abducted, with 11 escaping shortly afterwards.The official response drew criticism from Amnesty International, which accused Nigerian authorities of \"desperate denial\".The rights group urged officials to \"take immediate and concrete measures to prevent rampant abductions that are gradually becoming the norm in Nigeria.\"In November, more than 300 students and teachers were taken from a Catholic school in Niger state, which neighbours Kaduna, before being released in two groups.Nigeria faces multiple, overlapping security challenges beyond kidnappings, including an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and frequent clashes between herders and farmers in central regions over land and water.Security experts say efforts to tackle these crises are hampered by corruption, poor intelligence sharing, and underfunded local police forces.The security situation has drawn international attention. In December, the US conducted airstrikes in north-western Nigeria on Christmas Day, targeting two camps run by an Islamist militant group.Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is home to more than 250 ethnic groups and is roughly divided between a predominantly Muslim north and a largely Christian south, with significant mixing in central regions. The government maintains that people of all faiths have been victims of the widespread violence.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "US and India reach trade deal, Trump says after Modi call12 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesAccording to Trump, India has agreed to purchase over $500bn worth of US goods. US President Donald Trump has announced a trade deal with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to slash US tariffs on the nation's goods to 18% from 50%.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said India would reduce trade barriers to zero and stop buying Russian oil.The announcement comes less than a week after India and the European Union announced a landmark trade deal that capped nearly two decades of on-off talks. Modi said on X that he is \"delighted\" that an agreement with the US had been reached. Trump said a morning phone call with Modi included discussions of trade and the Russia-Ukraine war. \"He agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and to buy much more oil from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.He added that he, at Modi's request, immediately \"agreed to a trade deal\" that would see tariffs lowered and India's tariffs and non-tariff barriers reduced to zero. Additionally, Trump said Modi committed to buying more than $500bn (£366bn) worth of American goods including energy, technology, agriculture and coal products.The trade relationship between the US and India has been strained since August, when the US imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India - the highest for a country in Asia. This included a 25% penalty linked to India's purchase of Russian oil.A White House official confirmed to the BBC that the Russian oil-linked tariffs will be dropped as part of the agreement and other tariffs lowered to put the rate at 18%.\"Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement,\" Modi said on X.\"When two large economies and the world's largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation,\" he added.Indian exports to the US plummeted sharply as Trump's tariffs took effect.Officials in Delhi have been seeking partnerships with other countries also grappling with Trump's tariffs.Last week, India and the European Union announced a free trade agreement that is set to lower taxes on nearly all goods between India and the bloc of 27 European states, as both sides seek to deepen ties in the face of increasing tensions with the US. The agreement, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called \"the mother of all deals\", is poised to double EU exports to India by 2032, according to the EU.Terry Haines, founder of Pangaea Policy, an analysis and forecasting firm, called the Washington-Delhi deal \"an answer to those thinking the EU is flanking or gaining speed on the US on trade.\"He said he expected US markets to \"cheer\" the agreement. We Pay the Tariffs, a coalition of 800 US small businesses, criticised the announcement, noting that before Trump's tariffs policies were implemented, American importers paid an average of 2.5% on goods from India. \"This 'deal' locks in a rate six times higher than what we were paying a year ago,\" the organisation's director, Dan Anthony, said. \"That's not relief, it's a permanent tax hike that will be in place for a long time.\" US stocks inched higher after Trump announced the trade deal with Delhi on Truth Social.

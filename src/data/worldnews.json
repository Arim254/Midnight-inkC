    "body": "1 day agoLyse DoucetChief international correspondentWatch: BBC asks Trump if breakup of Nato is price he is willing to pay for GreenlandOn day one, he put the world on notice. \"Nothing will stand in our way,\" President Donald Trump declared, to thunderous applause, as he ended his inauguration speech in a cold Washington winter on this day last year, at the start of his second term. Did the world fail to take enough notice?Tucked into his speech was a mention of the 19th Century doctrine of \"manifest destiny\" – the idea that the US was divinely ordained to expand its territory across the continent, spreading American ideals.At that moment, the Panama Canal was in his sights. \"We're taking it back,\" Trump announced.Now that same declaration, expressed with absolute resolve, is directed at Greenland. \"We have to have it,\" is the new mantra. It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk.US history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will.No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two.There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity.Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing.\"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name.EPA/ShutterstockFrench President Emmanuel Macron spoke at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday but avoided any direct mention of TrumpThere is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force.Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order.When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing.\"Fine introduced a bill called \"Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act\" in Congress last week.How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way?Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief.\"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue.It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again.\"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump (left) was seen chatting to Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte at a Nato summit at the Hague in JuneHe doesn't talk like a traditional politician,\" explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. \"He says and then he does,\" is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents.Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office.But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right.\"He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power,\" says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine.\"He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that.\"And he doesn't hide it.\"Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit,\" Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \"We're tremendously feared.\"If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases.\"I need to own it,\" is how Trump flatly puts it.And he often makes it clear, \"I like to win.\" There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about.His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling.ReutersMerchandise opposing a US takeover of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, have appeared in shops in CopenhagenIn the Saudi capital Riyadh in May, we watched how his major speech on his first foreign trip of his second term met a rapturous reception.Trump took aim at the American \"interventionists\" whom he excoriated for having \"wrecked far more nations than they built... in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\"In June when Israel attacked Iran, Trump reportedly warned Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to put his diplomacy at risk with his military threats against Tehran. By the end of the week, when he saw Israel's success in assassinating top nuclear scientists and security chiefs, Trump exclaimed: \"I think it's been excellent.\"\"Sane-washing\" was the phrase coined months ago by Edward Luce of the Financial Times to describe the world's polite portrayals of Trump, the succession of leaders landing at his door with glittering gifts and gilded praise to try to win him over to their side.\"Trump's apologists – a more numerous crowd than true believers - work round the clock to sane-wash his policies into something coherent,\" Luce wrote in his latest column.ReutersTrump met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh in May 2025It was on full display last October when leaders the world over were summoned to join him at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh to celebrate his ringing declaration that \"at long last we have peace in the Middle East\" for the first time in \"3,000 years.\"The first significant phase of his peace plan had brought about a desperately needed ceasefire in Gaza and the urgent release of Israeli hostages. It was Trump's muscular diplomacy that forced Netanyahu, as well as Hamas, to agree to it. It was a major breakthrough only Trump could achieve. But it wasn't – sadly - the dawn of peace. No-one there said the quiet part out loud.Last year Trump's approach was framed as manifest destiny. This year it's the early 19th Century Monroe Doctrine now updated, since the Venezuela invasion, as the \"Donroe Doctrine.\" President Trump now owns it, bolstered by his fervent backers on his team, with his belief that America can act at will in its backyard, and beyond, to protect American interests.ReutersIn October, Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White HouseSometimes he is called an isolationist, sometimes an interventionist. But there's always that slogan which returned him to power - Make America Great Again.And his letter to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre highlighted his obsessive pique over not winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Trump informed Støre: \"I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\"\"It's a good day to have a Nordic temperament,\" Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide diplomatically remarked to me when I asked about this moment. Norway has been calm, with ice-hard firmness, in its defence of Greenland and Denmark and collective security in the Arctic.European responses still stretch across this slippery political ice.Macron has vowed to launch the EU's \"trade bazooka\" of counter-tariffs and restricting access to the EU's lucrative market.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, one of the American president's closest European allies, has vaguely spoken of a \"problem of understanding and miscommunication.\"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has strongly and publicly defended Greenland's territorial integrity but wants to protect the strong personal bond he's built over the past year by avoiding retaliatory tariffs.ReutersSir Keir Starmer has maintained a largely cordial relationship with Trump since he started his second term as presidentThe gloves are off for Trump as he posts the private messages he's receiving from leaders using the old tools of statecraft to try to keep him on side.\"Let us have a dinner in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the US,\" suggested the French president who also queried, in the midst of praise for other foreign policy successes, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland\".\"Can't wait to see you\", wrote Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who once called Trump \"daddy\" for his forceful handling of the Iran-Israel 12-day war last year.Nato boss commends 'daddy' Trump's handling of Israel-Iran conflictRutte, and others, have credited Trump's blunt threats for forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called for by previous US presidents and started by Nato members themselves in the shadow of Russian threats.On the other side of the Atlantic, the country which has long lived in America's shadow has been trying to forge a different path forward, albeit with challenges of their own.\"We have to take the world as it is, not the way we want it to be,\" was the candid reflection of Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney on his trip to China last week.It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear signal of this fast changing world.Watch: Canada-China trade relationship \"more predictable\" than with US, says CarneyTrump's astonishing threat to annex his neighbour to the north surfaced again this week in a post on social media which showed the western hemisphere, including Canada and Greenland, covered in stars and stripes. Canadians know there's still a risk they could be next.Carney, the former central banker, rose to Canada's highest office last year buoyed by Canadians' belief he was the best prepared to take on Trump. He responded \"dollar for dollar\" from the start, imposing retaliatory tariffs – until it became too painful for the much smaller Canadian economy, which sends more than 70% of its trade south of its border.When Carney took to the stage at Davos on Tuesday, he also focused on this jarring juncture.\"American hegemony in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes,\" he said, adding bluntly: \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.\"On Wednesday Trump will speak from that same podium with the world watching.Asked by the New York Times this month what could stop him, Trump replied: \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.\"That's what lies behind an armada of allies now seeking to persuade, flatter, force him – to change his mind.This time, it's not certain they will succeed.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "2 days agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US \"has to have\" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't \"gonna push back too much\". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato.President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "4 hours agoTabby WilsonBBC/Getty ImagesBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni have been at loggerheads since starring together in It Ends With UsBlake Lively referred to Justin Baldoni as a \"doofus director\" and a \"clown\", according to newly unsealed court documents from the actress's legal case.The pair starred together in It Ends With Us, but Lively sued Baldoni in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and waging a smear campaign against her. Baldoni strongly denies the claims and is defending the lawsuit, which named him and his production company, Wayfarer studios, which was behind It Ends With Us. Text messages from 2023 between Lively and people close to her appear to show that Lively called Baldoni a \"rabid pig\", while her friend Taylor Swift suggested Baldoni knew the lawsuit was coming \"because he's gotten out his tiny violin\".Baldoni's $400m (£295m) counter-suit was dismissed by a judge last June. Lively's case is set to go to trial in May.  The newly unsealed documents show both Lively and Baldoni venting to friends and colleagues about filming It Ends With Us, and the subsequent press tour, ahead of the film's release in August 2024.In the messages, Lively referred to Baldoni as \"this doofus director of my movie\" and described him as \"a clown\" who \"thinks he's a writer now\".In their filing earlier this week, Lively's team did not deny the language she had used but said the text messages were missing context.They referred the court to the \"complete\" text exchange, including subsequent messages from Lively to Baldoni which said \"we all benefit\" from her relationship with Swift and her husband Ryan Reynolds, and \"you will too, I can promise you\".Sigrid McCawley, a member of Lively's legal team, said in a statement to the BBC the newly unsealed evidence \"shows the concerns of Ms. Lively and others were documented in real-time as early as Spring 2023, and Wayfarer understood them as \"sexual harassment\" concerns.\"McCawley's statement continued, \"The evidence also documents how Wayfarer refused to investigate, but instead attempted to \"bury\" Ms. Lively and others who spoke up through retaliation.\"Baldoni's legal team has not responded to the BBC's request for comment, but Bryan Feldman, a lawyer for Baldoni and Wayfarer, told CNN, \"the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law. A simple read of the newly released message exchanges make the truth abundantly clear. We remain confident in the legal process and clearing the names of all of the Justin Baldoni parties.\" Text messages between Lively and singer Taylor Swift (pictured) appear to be among the unsealed documentsThe messages also show Lively saying of Baldoni: \"Despite his repeated disturbing behaviour and acts, I still feel bad for him.\"To be reminded multiple times daily that he's smearing me for... asking him not to sexually or emotionally harass me? For making his movie better? For calling in all the favours to turn out all the biggest musicians and entertainers to contribute to making his movie better? For leading a marketing campaign for free?\"She continued: \"I literally don't know a single thing I've done that he can smear me about. Ryan [Reynolds] says [Baldoni] should be writing me apology and thank you letters every day. And instead he chooses to make a monster outta me.\"But what's my crime. I've only ever stayed focused on the work and given him every opportunity to make it better. And he just keeps behaving like a rabid pig.\"The messages also appear to show Lively texted Baldoni's former The Man Enough Podcast co-host, Liz Plank in May 2023, and told her that \"today I came home and cried\" following an \"SOS set visit\". Plank responded by saying that she \"thought maybe things had gotten better\", and that it was \"astounding they have gotten away with so much\". It is unclear who \"they\" refers to.The documents note that Plank recalled working on Baldoni's set as \"truly one of the worst days of [her] life\". Later that year, Lively also sent texts to actress and co-star Jenny Slate, and said she was \"dreading\" going back to set and \"getting hits of the experience in really upsetting ways\".In her deposition, Slate also alleged misconduct on the set of the film, with court documents revealing that she had made complaints against Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath during the course of filming It Ends With Us.Heath is the CEO of Wayfarer Studios.Similarly, texts sent by Baldoni also suggest friction between him and Lively. In February 2024, Baldoni told Heath that he was concerned that Lively would use the allegations she had made against him as leverage. He wrote: \"She had the nuclear bomb. If she doesn't promote the movie she can leak that I'm a bad person or that she felt unsafe with me and 'all the stuff' she has on me. Then she's the victim.\"Her legal filing accuses Baldoni and Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\", in addition to a hostile working environment.The text messages were unsealed on Tuesday before a summary judgement hearing in Lively's ongoing lawsuit that is scheduled for 22 January.",

    "body": "A tribunal in Colombia has sentenced a former paramilitary leader, Salvatore Mancuso, to 40 years in prison for murders and forced disappearances committed at the height of the country's armed conflict.Mancuso was a commander in the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing paramilitary group originally created to defend landowners from attacks by Marxist guerrilla groups, which became involved in drug trafficking.The tribunal found that under his command, AUC members committed more than 100 crimes in La Guajira povince between 2002 and 2006.Mancuso was sent back to Colombia in 2024 after serving a 15-year prison sentence in the US for drug trafficking. The 61-year-old was sentenced on Monday by a special tribunal created to deal with cases arising from Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which at least 450,000 people were killed between 1985 and 2018 according to figures compiled by a truth commission.The tribunal said that Mancuso's 40-year-long sentence could be reduced to eight years if he agreed to work with the transitional justice and took part in reparation activities. Mancuso's name became a byword for the atrocities committed by AUC groups in the 1990s and early 2000s.The tribunal said that under his leadership the AUC had targeted members of the indigenous Wayuu group who live in La Guajira, in the far north of Colombia.It documented 117 crimes, including murders, forced disappearances and gender violence, committed by the AUC in the area.Indigenous groups were often caught in between warring factions of Colombia's armed conflict.Marxist rebel groups forcibly recruited many indigenous children into their ranks, holding them against their will in rebel camps where they had to perform chores and were sometimes forced to fight.The AUC and other paramilitary groups, which suspected the indigenous groups of siding with the rebels, drove them off their land and waged a campaign of terror and intimidation against them. The AUC negotiated a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2005 but offshoots of the group refused to lay down arms and became even more heavily involved in the trafficking of drugs, which they had already been engaging in to raise funds for their fight against the guerrilla. Mancuso was extradited to the US in 2008, where he was put on trial on drug trafficking charges. He was sentenced in 2015, after having been found guilty of smuggling large quantities of cocaine into the US \"to arm a paramilitary force of more than 30,000 fighters and cement his control over regions of Colombia\", the US justice department said at the time. After he had served his sentence in the US, Mancuso, a dual Colombian and Italian national, asked to be allowed to move to Italy. But his request was denied and he was deported to Colombia. There, he offered to provide testimony into how Colombian politicians, business leaders and other members of the country's establishment allegedly cooperated with the AUC.Pleased with his offer of co-operation, the government of Colombian President Gustavo Petro named Mancuso a \"promoter of peace\", saying he would act as a mediator between the administration and illegal armed groups still active in the country. The move was vehemently criticised by human rights groups who pointed to the atrocities his group carried out under his command. With additional reporting by BBC Monitoring's Latin America team. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoThomas MackintoshandRachel HaganThe US military has begun the transfer up to 7,000 Islamic State (IS) group detainees from prisons in north-eastern Syria to Iraq, as Syria's new government takes control of areas long run autonomously by Kurdish-led forces.US Central Command (Centcom) said it had already moved 150 IS fighters from Hassakeh province to a \"secure location\" in Iraq.It said the move aimed to prevent prisoners breaking out and regrouping.The transfer follows a ceasefire agreement that has brought much of Syria's north east under Damascus control, after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) withdrew from key areas, including detention sites holding thousands of IS suspects and their relatives.CENTCOM said its commander Admiral Brad Cooper discussed the transfers with Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, stressing the need for Syrian forces to uphold the ceasefire and avoid any action that could interfere with what he described as an \"orderly and secure transfer\" of detainees.Rights group Reprieve warned that detainees transferred to Iraq could face torture and execution and urged the UK government to establish whether any British nationals were among those being moved.The charity said it believed there were no more than 10 British men held in the prisons, though exact numbers were unclear. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said.Despite the ceasefire there have been fresh clashes, with Syria's defence ministry saying seven soldiers were killed in a drone attack in Hassakeh on Wednesday, describing the incident a violation of the ceasefire.The SDF denied carrying out the strike and accused Damascus of also launching attacks, including near the town of Kobane on the Turkish border.The government and SDF had earlier blamed each other over the escape of suspected IS fighters from an SDF-run prison in Shaddadi, in southern Hassakeh.Syria's interior ministry said on Monday night that its special forces and army soldiers had entered the town following \"the escape of around 120 [IS] terrorists\" from the prison. It said security forces later recaptured 81 of the fugitives.The SDF said it had lost control of the prison following clashes with \"Damascus-affiliated factions\", warning of a \"serious security catastrophe\".SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members may have escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency. The SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is also holding IS members and leaders.The SDF helped US-led forces defeat IS during Syria's 13-year civil war and, backed by the US, went on to jail around 12,000 IS members, including thousands of foreigners, while detaining tens of thousands of relatives in camps across the north east.However US special envoy Tom Barrack has said the US alliance with the SDF had \"largely expired\" and that his country was currently focused on securing IS detention facilities and facilitating talks between the SDF and al-Sharaa's government.\"This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime,\" he wrote on X.",

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has agreed to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files.Committee chairman James Comer, who is leading the investigation, says Maxwell will depose virtually on 9 February. Maxwell's legal team has previously said she would decline to answer questions under her constitutional right to remain silent unless she is granted legal immunity. Comer, previewing the deposition, said, \"her lawyers have been saying she is going to plead the Fifth,\" referring to the US Fifth Amendment right to decline to speak to authorities.The announcement from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee comes as the Trump administration continues to face fierce scrutiny for its handling of the Epstein case.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking  teenage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein.  In July, the committee declined to offer Maxwell legal immunity in exchange for her testimony.In August, the committee issued legal summons to Maxwell, requiring her to submit evidence under oath. Maxwell's legal team said that requiring her to both testify from jail, and without any legal immunity, were \"non-starters\".The lawyers said she \"cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity\" as speaking from prison \"creates real security risks and undermines the integrity of the process\".House lawmakers cannot force Maxwell to waive her Fifth Amendment protections.On Tuesday, Maxwell's legal team said in a letter to the committee that she would continue to refuse to testify.\"Put plainly, proceeding under these circumstances would serve no other purpose than pure political theater and a complete waste of taxpayer monies,\" the attorneys wrote. \"The Committee would obtain no testimony, no answers, and no new facts.\"Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021, had appealed against the conviction to the  Supreme Court last October but the top court declined to hear the former British socialite's appeal.Her only route to leave prison early would be a presidential pardon, unless she is able to persuade a federal judge in New York to vacate or amend her sentence. The White House has denied that Trump is considering granting her clemency, however, Trump has also said he has not ruled it out.Separately, the Department of Justice faced a deadline of 19 December last year to release all remaining Epstein files in its possession. So far only a fraction of them have been made public.The department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the number of redactions in the files, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations.Meanwhile, the House committee is also meeting to discuss former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton's refusal to appear before the panel to answer questions related to the investigation into Epstein.The committee has said it is considering filing contempt charges against the two.

    "body": "14 hours agoJames Waterhousein Córdoba, SpainBBC/Moose CampbellYamilei's brother-in-law Victor was among the victims of Sunday night's crashEduardo Morán, a doctor at Córdoba's Reina Sofía Hospital, suspected it was serious.He and his wife, also a medic, had been asked to head to work after reports that two high speed trains had collided nearby.\"We were preparing different parts of the hospital,\" he recalls. \"Not just the emergency room, but the intensive care unit, all the surgery theatres and the regular floor. Everybody was there.\"As the patients arrived, their injuries ranged from scratches to missing limbs. Staff prioritised who to treat. Some were operated on, others monitored.Eduardo had never seen such an influx of casualties in his 20-year career, and yet the hospital was not overwhelmed.\"We were expecting more,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, there were a lot of people who didn't make it and died on the railway.\"Social MediaAmong the victims was María del Carmen Abril, returning from a surprise birthday partyIn dense woodland 36 miles from Córdoba lies the tangled wreckage of the two trains that collided on Sunday evening.A gap in the straight section of track is thought to be what investigators are focusing on.At least 43 people lost their lives here, and as sniffer dogs weave between the empty seats and shattered windows, there is still a hunger to unearth answers as to what caused Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.As officials called for patience, news broke of a second derailment in almost as many days.Unlike Sunday night's disaster, the train that crashed near Barcelona was not a high-speed model, and the accident involved a wall that collapsed onto the track in heavy rain.Nevertheless, it has led to the Spanish train drivers' union calling a strike over the \"unacceptable constant deterioration of the railway\".For the families and friends of those missing and killed in southern Spain, these events have only added to their unanswered questions.BBC/Moose CampbellJose Manuel Muñoz lost his friend Abril in Sunday's high-speed rail crashThroughout Saturday afternoon and into the night in Córdoba, Jose Manuel Muñoz and his friends were holding a surprise 50th birthday party for María del Carmen Abril, a teacher.The party was barely over when Abril, as she is known, made her way back north to Madrid. She thanked her hosts on their WhatsApp group, and they later frantically replied to see if she was OK.Abril was sitting on one of the carriages that came off the tracks into an oncoming train. Her death was confirmed the next day.Carlos Alvarez/Getty ImagesAn Iryo train was the first to derail at Adamuz, crashing into an oncoming train\"It's very difficult to explain the contrast of emotions,\" says Muñoz, sitting in the tranquil surroundings of Córdoba's Jardines de la Victoria, a park next to his workshop where he makes picture frames.\"We spent one day celebrating life with our friend, then there were two days of uncertainty, without knowing anything about what happened to her, then we get the confirmation that she's dead.\"He describes Abril as a \"lovely, generous, affectionate person who loved flowers and was always trying to solve other people's problems\".And yet Muñoz does not blame anyone for her death; instead, he puts it down to bad luck.Under the low winter sun and next to the city's bull ring is Córdoba's Civic Centre. Outside are two makeshift tents where the families of the missing give DNA samples in the hope their relatives can at least be identified.BBC/Marianne BaisnéeYamilei shows a picture of her brother-in-law, Victor Luis TeránBecause of a last-minute change in travel plans, Jamilet's brother-in law, Victor Luis Terán, took an earlier train and became caught up in the crash as he travelled south from Madrid to Huelva.It was not until Tuesday night that confirmation came that Victor, a Bolivian national, was among the 43 victims.Yamilei is looking for answers: \"That's all we want. Because we can't do it any more.\"The truth she seeks is likely to take weeks to arrive, and official calls for patience have only been hampered by a devastating three days on Spain's rail network.Additional reporting by Marianne Baisnée and Marta Jimenez",

In a post on X, the second lady said she is looking forward to welcoming a boy in late July. \"Usha and the baby are doing well,\" a statement posted on Tuesday to the second lady's social media account read. Vance and his wife, Usha, 40, have three young children: Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel.Usha Vance (née Chilukuri) was born and raised in the working-class suburbs of San Diego, California, to a mechanical engineer father and a molecular biologist mother who had moved to the US from Andhra Pradesh, India.She met JD Vance as a student at Yale Law School in 2010, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".Before becoming second lady, Usha Vance had a legal career, including a job as a corporate litigator at firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in San Francisco. She also worked for conservative judges, Chief Justice John Roberts on the Supreme Court and appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh, before he was appointed by Trump to the Supreme Court. Usha Vance is the first to have a baby as second lady, though other first ladies have had children while their husbands were in office. First lady Frances Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland, gave birth to daughter Esther in the White House in 1893, followed by a second child, Marion, who was born outside the White House. JD Vance has been one of the most vocal members of the Trump administration in calling for higher birth rates in the US. \"Let me say very simply: I want more babies in the United States of America,\" he said in 2025.

    "body": "Shock and confusion as Spain struggles for answers after deadly train crash19 hours agoGuy Hedgecoein Adamuz, southern SpainReutersSpain's King Felipe (far right) visited the crash site with Queen Letizia on TuesdaySunday's high-speed train crash in southern Spain, the worst in over a decade, has been a devastating tragedy for the country, with the loss of at least 42 lives.And amid the grief, many are asking what could have caused such a failure on one of Europe's most admired rail systems.The CIAF rail investigatory commission has started analysing why a train travelling north from Málaga was derailed on a straight section of the route, causing it to collide with an oncoming train, which was also derailed. The Spanish government has described the accident as \"extremely strange\".Three bodies already located in the wreckage were recovered on Tuesday afternoon, and a 42nd victim was also found at the crash site near Adamuz.The shock felt in this sleepy town has been compounded by confusion at how a rail route that ran efficiently for so long suddenly failed.After its inauguration in 1992, Spain's high-speed rail, or AVE, network was seen as a symbol of the country's modernisation. Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe.A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.Watch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decadeSeveral officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause.Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".EPAGrieving Spaniards want answers about what caused the deadly crashHowever, investigators are also examining the section of track where the derailment occurred and intend to analyse parts of it in a laboratory. The revelation that part of the track at the crash site was broken has encouraged speculation that this might be the culprit. The government has been keen to play down such conclusions, pointing out that the track may have been damaged by the force of the collision.Some observers have drawn attention to possible underlying factors on the network. It has emerged that rail infrastructure administrator Adif drew attention to eight technical issues on the line near where the accident happened on social media over the last year. Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150km (93 mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit.Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to \"fear for my safety and that of my daughter\".In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing \"a lack of comfort and reliability\" for those travelling. It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and \"to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers\".As a result of Sunday's crash, and the separate derailment of a Rodalies train which killed a driver near Barcelona on Tuesday, Semaf has called a strike. Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years.\"When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz.That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.",

    "body": "8 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterReutersUS President Donald Trump appeared on course for a setback at America's top court on Wednesday over his unprecedented move to fire a central bank governor.Supreme Court justices from the left and right asked why they should speed through such an impactful decision, citing concerns about process and implications for central bank independence and the wider economy.  Trump in August said he was removing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which she has denied.Cook has argued she did not receive due process to dispute those claims, which Fed defenders say were a pretext to allow Trump to assert more control over the bank. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who was appointed by Trump, was among the justices to express sympathy with Cook's arguments, asking: \"What's the fear of more process here?\"He later warned the administration's interpretation of the law would \"weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve\".'Quite a big mistake'By law, a president can only remove governors of the Federal Reserve \"for cause\".That requirement was intended to shield the central bank from political pressure and allow it to make policy independently.The White House contends it has met that bar, accusing Cook of filing mortgage forms claiming two different principal residences at the same time. Banks typically offer lower interest rates for primary homes. The Trump administration has asked the court to allow the president to remove Cook, a move lower courts had blocked while the case played out. \"Even if it's inadvertent or a mistake, it's quite a big mistake,\" said solicitor general D John Sauer, who was arguing the case for the administration.He said such conduct could undermine confidence in the bank and that courts were bound to defer to the president's judgement when it comes to finding a cause. He dismissed questions about process, noting that Trump had alerted Cook to the issue on social media before formally firing her.\"There was a social media post,\" he said. \"And the response was defiance.\"'Nothing criminal whatsoever'Cook has denied committing fraud.In a November letter to the Justice Department, her lawyers said the claims were based on \"cherry-picked, incomplete snippets of the full documents\". They said there was \"one stray reference to primary residence\" in a mortgage application for an apartment in Alabama, but noted that the file also contained \"truthful and more specific disclosures about the property's use\".\"There is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud,\" her lawyers wrote.Arguing on behalf of Cook, Paul Clement said people in her position should have the chance to present their evidence and be shielded from having a decision made in advance. He said the administration's interpretation of the law would make the protection that Congress intended by inserting the \"for cause\" requirement \"toothless\".Some justices indicated that they shared those concerns. The \"position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines - that would weaken if not shatter the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Kavanaugh said. The lawsuit is seen as high stakes, given swirling debate about Trump's efforts to influence the Fed, which he wants to lower interest rates more aggressively to boost economic growth.Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was among the officials expected to attend. He is facing his own criminal probe related to cost overruns during renovations of Fed properties - concerns he has called \"pretexts\".In other recent cases, the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has allowed the White House to proceed with firings. But it has signalled that it views the Federal Reserve, which was designed to set policy independently from the White House, as different.In a statement after the hearing, Cook's lawyers said they were \"hopeful\" the court would recognise the importance of the Fed being able to operate free from political interference. In her own statement, Cook, who attended the hearing, said: \"This case is about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure. \"For as long as I serve at the Federal Reserve, I will uphold the principle of political independence in service to the American people.\"Several justices, including conservatives, indicated they were hesitant to greenlight Cook's removal without courts having resolved issues like whether the mortgage filings, which were made before Cook was appointed, would meet the bar for a \"for cause\" firing. \"We know that the independence of the agency is very important and that that independence is harmed if we decide these issues too quickly and without due consideration,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal. \"So to me, waiting to have at least the lower courts look at these issues first makes the most sense.\"\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody... in such a hurried manner?\" asked Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, pressed Sauer to explain what harm the president would suffer by waiting, noting that the court had been warned of potentially dire economic consequences of a decision that could weaken belief in the central bank's independence. \"There's a risk,\" she said. \"Doesn't that counsel... caution on our part?\"",

    "body": "Oldest cave painting of red claw hand could rewrite human creativity timeline13 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentA stencilled outline of a hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is the world's oldest known cave painting, researchers say.It shows a red outline of a hand whose fingers were reworked, researchers say, to create a claw-like motif which indicates an early leap in symbolic imagination.The painting has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago – around 1,100 years before the previous record, a controversial hand stencil in Spain.The find also strengthens the argument that our species, Homo sapiens, had reached the wider Australia–New Guinea landmass, known as Sahul, by around 15,000 years earlier than some researchers argue.Over the past decade, a series of discoveries on Sulawesi has overturned the old idea that art and abstract thinking in our species burst suddenly into life in Ice Age Europe and spread from there.Cave art is seen as a key marker of when humans began to think in truly abstract, symbolic ways – the kind of imagination that underpins language, religion and science.Early paintings and engravings show people not just reacting to the world, but representing it, sharing stories and identities in a way no other species is known to have done.Professor Adam Brumm of Griffiths University in Australia, who co-led the project, told BBC News, that the latest discovery, published in the journal Nature, adds to the emerging view that there was no awakening for humanity in Europe. Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved.\"When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain\".The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old. In 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University.\"We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years\".The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock.One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world.Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say.Ahdi Agus OktavianaMore recent elongated hand stencils found elsewhere in Suluwesi shows how prevalent the red claw image was among these ancient artists.After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is \"a very us thing to do\".  He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method.Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region.Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed \"hundreds of new rock art sites\" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years.Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived.For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN).\"It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia.\"Many archaeologists once argued for a European \"big bang\" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before.Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News.\"What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that\".",

The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones.Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos.Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far.The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.Getty ImagesProtesters on a street in Tehran on 9 January BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as \"seditionists\".Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out.Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify.We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. \"It was just too much,\" they said.Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. Crowds of anti-government protesters in TehranThe slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.",

    "body": "17 hours agoEmer Moreau,Business reporterandSimon Browning,Transport producerRyanair boss Michael O'Leary has thanked Elon Musk for all the additional publicity that their online spat has brought his airline, saying sales have risen two to three percent in the last five days.Musk has suggested he could buy the budget airline and called O'Leary \"insufferable\" and \"an idiot\", after O'Leary rejected the idea of using Musk's Starlink technology to provide wifi on flights.At a press conference on Wednesday, O'Leary said he takes \"no insult\" at Musk's jibes, and that he is regularly insulted at home by his four teenage children and many others.He also said Musk is \"free\" to invest in Ryanair shares, but under EU laws, Musk could not own a majority of a European airline.Musk is the world's richest man with an estimated net worth of $769bn (£573bn), and O'Leary runs Europe's busiest airline. Both are known to court media attention with strong language and provocative statements.O'Leary said at the press conference that his team is going to X's office in Dublin to give Musk a free Ryanair ticket to thank him for the \"wonderful boost\" in publicity he's had.\"If he wants to call me an idiot, he wouldn't be the first, and he certainly won't be the last ... But if it helps to boost Ryanair sales, you could insult me all day, every day.\"The squabble between the two intensified after O'Leary called Musk an \"idiot\" and said using Starlink to provide Ryanair passengers with free wifi would not be cost-effective.O'Leary added that the cost of installing Starlink would be €250m (£218m) to fit all necessary equipment — and would increase fuel costs by €100m (£87m) per year.He said he thinks only 5% of Ryanair passengers would pay for wifi, so there would be poor return on investment. On the prospect of Musk buying the Irish airline, O'Leary said: \"We're a publicly owned company. He's free to [buy shares] at any time, but non-European citizens cannot own a majority of European airlines.\"\"If he wants to invest in Ryanair, we would think it's a very good investment.\"O'Leary called all social media \"a cesspit\", but conceded it was important for Ryanair's marketing.The company is known to take an irreverent approach to social media, often mocking customers for complaining about the airline's cost-cutting measures.O'Leary said he'd had no direct contact with Elon Musk.Musk has floated the idea of buying Ryanair several times on X in the past week, but EU-based airlines must be majority owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.Last week, after German airline Lufthansa announced it would install Starlink on its planes to provide all passengers with free wi-fi, O'Leary said Musk knew \"zero\" about flight aerodynamics.",

    "body": "8 hours agoDavid GrittenandDan Johnson,JerusalemThree Palestinian journalists have been killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza, first responders say.Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said their car was hit in the al-Zahra area and named them as Mohammed Salah Qashta, Anas Ghneim and Abdul Raouf Shaat. They are understood to have been working for an Egyptian relief organisation.The Israeli military said it struck \"several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas... in a manner that posed a threat\" to its troops. It added that the incident was under examination.Another eight people, two of them children, were killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire across Gaza on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.Medics said three people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli tank fire elsewhere in central Gaza, and that a 13-year-old boy and a woman were killed by Israeli gunfire in the southern Khan Younis area, according to Reuters news agency.The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning that its troops had killed a \"terrorist who crossed the Yellow Line and approached\" them, without mentioning a location. The Yellow Line demarcates territory in Gaza still under Israeli control under the ceasefire deal.At least 466 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on 10 October, according to the health ministry.The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups over the same period.The three photojournalists killed on Wednesday were reportedly working for the Egyptian Relief Committee in the Gaza Strip to film its camps for displaced people.A spokesperson for the humanitarian organisation said the car that was struck was marked with its logo and that it was \"targeted during a humanitarian mission, resulting in the martyrdom of three individuals\".Hamas called the strike a \"dangerous escalation of the flagrant violations of the ceasefire agreement\".The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said it constituted a war crime and evidence of what it called \"a systematic Israeli policy aimed at silencing the Palestinian voice, obstructing the transmission of facts, and concealing crimes committed against civilians\", according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.Abdul Raouf Shaat was regular contributor to French news agency AFP, which expressed \"immense sadness\" at his death and demanded a \"full and transparent investigation\".The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also said it was \"appalled\".\"Israel, which possesses advanced technology capable of identifying its targets, has an obligation under international law to protect journalists,\" regional director Sara Qudah said.The CPJ has documented the killing of at least 206 journalists and media workers by Israeli fire in Gaza since the start of the war - the deadliest conflict for journalists ever documented.Before Wednesday, two journalists had been killed in Israeli strikes during the ceasefire, and a third had been killed by members of a Palestinian armed group, according to the US-based organisation's data.International news outlets, including the BBC, rely on local journalists in Gaza, as Israel does not allow them to send foreign journalists into the territory independently. Some journalists are taken into Gaza by the Israeli military under controlled access.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,550 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBethany BellVienna correspondentReutersEgisto Ott is accused of collecting large amounts of data and handing information to Russian intelligenceFormer intelligence official Egisto Ott goes on trial in Vienna on Thursday, accused of spying for Russia in what is being dubbed Austria's biggest spy trial in years.Egisto Ott, 63, is charged with having handed over information to Russian intelligence officers and to Jan Marsalek, the fugitive executive of collapsed German payments firm Wirecard.Ott denies the charges.Jan Marsalek, who is also an Austrian citizen, is wanted by German police for alleged fraud and is currently believed to be in Moscow, having fled via Austria in 2020.The subject of an Interpol Red Notice, he is alleged to be an intelligence asset for the FSB, Russia's secretive security service.The spy scandal has revived fears that Austria remains a hotbed of Russian espionage activity and observers will also be watching closely for details that could emerge about Marsalek.Prosecutors in Vienna say Egisto Ott \"abused his authority\" as an Austrian intelligence official by collecting large amounts of personal data, such as locations, vehicle registration numbers, or travel movements.They say he did this between 2015 and 2020 without authorisation, often using national and international police databases.Prosecutors also charge him with supporting \"a secret intelligence service of the Russian Federation to the detriment of the Republic of Austria\" by collecting secret facts and a large amount of personal data from police databases between 2017 and 2021.They say Egisto Ott gave this information to Jan Marsalek and unknown representatives of the Russian intelligence service, and received payment in return.In 2022, prosecutors say, Jan Marsalek commissioned him to obtain a laptop containing secret electronic security hardware used by EU states for secure electronic communication. The laptop, they say, was handed over to the Russian intelligence service.He is also suspected, reports say, of having passed phone data from senior Austrian interior ministry officials to Russia.Austria's Standard newspaper says Egisto Ott apparently obtained the work phones after they accidentally fell into the River Danube on an interior ministry boating trip. He is alleged to have copied their contents and passed them on to Jan Marsalek, and Moscow.Egisto Ott is charged with abuse of authority and corruption and espionage against Austria and faces up to five years in prison, if he is found guilty.When he was arrested in 2024, Austria's then Chancellor, Karl Nehammer, described the case as \"a threat to democracy and our country's national security\".Munich PoliceJan Marsalek, former executive at Wirecard, is believed to have escaped to MoscowIn a separate development, prosecutors in the Austrian town of Wiener Neustadt have told the BBC that a former MP, Thomas Schellenbacher, has been charged with helping Marsalek to escape following the collapse of the Wirecard company in 2020, when it emerged that €1.9bn was missing from its accounts.Schellenbacher is alleged to have helped Jan Marsalek fly to Belarus, from Bad Vöslau in Austria, in June 2020.Schellenbacher was an MP for the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), which has been accused by Austria's Green Party, now in opposition, of enabling Russian espionage, of acting as \"an extension of Russia's arm\" in Austria.The FPÖ and its leader Herbert Kickl have denied the allegations - and have not faced any legal action in connection with any of them.Marsalek, who was the Wirecard's Chief Operating Officer, has since been charged with fraud and embezzlement, suspected of having inflated company's balance sheet total and sales volume.He is also believed to have been the controller of a group of Bulgarians who were convicted in London in 2025, of spying for Russia.Messages from that trial reveal Marsalek has had plastic surgery to alter his appearance as well as details of his life as a fugitive.\"I'm off to bed. Had another cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently, and I am dead tired and my head hurts,\" he wrote to one of the Bulgarians, Roussev, on Telegram in February 2022.In another, dated 11 May 2021, Roussev congratulated Marsalek for learning Russian.\"Well I am trying to improve my skills on a few fronts. Languages is one of them,\" the Austrian responded.\"In my new role as an international fugitive I must outperform James Bond.\"",

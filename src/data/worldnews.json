    "body": "More than 100 people have had to shelter in a shrine on a mountain top in Japan after heavy snowfall cut off access by road.Around 130 people were forced to spend the night in the halls and lobbies of the Mitsumine Shrine in the Saitama prefecture on Friday after the roads around it were closed due to safety concerns, public broadcaster NHK reports.The local authority confirmed the occupants of around 50 cars had stayed in the shrine building, and said no one had fallen ill.Japan is experiencing heavy snowfall at present, with up to 40cm forecast to fall in some parts on Saturday.Up to 80cm of snow has fallen in some parts of the country in the past 72 hours, data from the Japan Meteorological Agency shows, with more predicted to fall as a cold front persists.Several accidents around the Mitsumine Shrine including cars slipping had prompted the road closure, NHK reported, citing local police.Up to 4cm of snow has fallen in the region, while temperatures as low as -15C have made for icy conditions.Located 1,110m (3,640 ft) above sea level in the mountains near the city of Chichibu, the Mitsumine Shrine is a popular centre for Shinto worship and is dedicated to Izanami and Izanagi, the divine couple credited with creating the Japanese islands.The shrine is said to have been founded in the 1st Century by Prince Yamato Takeru no Mikoto, son of Emperor Keikō.",

    "body": "A hiker is believed to have been killed by at least one mountain lion in the US state of Colorado on Wednesday, according to wildlife officials.If confirmed, it would be the first fatal attack there since 1999.A group of hikers found the woman's body on a remote trail and spotted a lion nearby. After scaring off the predatory cat, they checked the body and could find no pulse, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Kara Van Hoose said.It was unclear whether one or multiple animals were involved in the attack, she added. Two mountain lions have been euthanised after an extensive search, and investigators are currently studying them for signs of human DNA.The hikers had thrown rocks at the mountain lion to drive it away, Ms Van Hoose told a news conference. CPW officers responding to the scene shot the lion, which ran off. They then tracked it to euthanise it.A second lion was found in the area and was also euthanised.If neither lion appears to be the culprit, the search will resume for a possible attacker. Under CPW rules, wildlife that kills a human being must be euthanised for public safety reasons.The woman's body showed signs of a mountain lion attack, according to Ms Van Hoose.The local sheriff's office has notified her next of kin, and will later disclose her identity, Ms Van Hoose told the BBC. She is believed to have been hiking alone.The Crosier Mountain Trail is north of Denver, near the Wyoming border, and close to Rocky Mountain National Park. It could be considered secluded, Ms Van Hoose said, adding that hikers often lose their phone signals there.The Larimer County sheriff, police from the nearby city of Estes Park and volunteer firefighters have been assisting in the search.A biologist conducting a deer survey by helicopter in the area helped look for the animal and transport personnel, according to CPW. Meanwhile, houndsmen brought dogs in to track scents, which Ms Van Hoose said was an often-effective way to locate mountain lions.Mountain lion attacks - both fatal and not - are rare in the state, with CPW recording 28 total since 1990.Mountain lions, also called pumas, cougars, catamounts or panthers, can be found throughout North America, but now are mostly in 15 western states, according to the Mountain Lion Foundation. They are mostly solitary animals, who spend most of their time hunting, the foundation says.",

    "body": "1 hour agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonSwiss prosecutors say the French managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people have been placed under criminal investigation.The blaze at Le Constellation in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve injured 119 other people, officials have said. With many of the injured identified, families now face an agonising wait for information about those still missing.The bodies of two Swiss women aged 21 and 16, and two Swiss men aged 18 and 16 were the first to be indentified and returned to their families, police said earlier.The likely cause of the fire was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation of how the fire began found. The French managers of Le Constellation are suspected of having committed homicide by negligence, causing bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in the canton of Valais said in a statement on Saturday afternoon.Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin called it \"one of the worst tragedies\" experienced by the country.Further details about the identified victims, including names, have not been released.On Friday, police said 113 of the injured have been identified, and include 71 Swiss, 14 French and 11 Italian citizens.Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process was continuing on Saturday and should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

    "body": "Two people including a three-year-old child have been killed and around 28 others injured in a Russian strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A multi-storey residential apartment block was almost completely destroyed in the dual missile attack on Friday afternoon, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called \"heinous\". Russia's Defence Ministry denied reports of an attack, suggesting the blast had been caused by Ukrainian ammunition detonating.The strike comes ahead of crunch talks on a US-brokered peace plan in Kyiv on Saturday.Zelensky says around 15 countries are expected to attend the talks, along with representatives from the EU and Nato, with a US delegation joining the meeting via video link. Leaders of the so-called coalition of the willing are then set to meet in France on 6 January.Officials in Kharkiv said the bodies of a woman and a three-year-old child were found in the rubble, with preliminary information suggesting the pair may have been a mother and son. \"Unfortunately, this is how the Russians treat life and people – they continue killing, despite all efforts by the world, and especially by the United States, in the diplomatic process,\" Zelensky wrote on X.Of the 28 injured, which included a six-month-old baby, 16 have been taken to hospital. A search and rescue operation is ongoing, with more than 80 volunteers working at the scene, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that its armed forces \"neither planned nor launched attacks using missile weapons or aircraft weapons within the city of Kharkiv\".It added that footage from before the attack showed \"heavy smoke of unknown origin\", which it cited as evidence of ammunition detonated by Ukrainian armed forces.The ministry also alleged that the reports were seeking to distract attention from a New Year's Eve strike on a hotel in a Russian-held part of the southern Kherson region of Ukraine.Russia has accused Ukraine of killing at least 27 people and injuring more than 30 others in the drone strike on a New Year's party in the village of Khorly on the Black Sea.The BBC has not been able to independently verify either these claims or the number of casualties.Ukraine told the BBC it would not directly respond to sources of information such as claims from governors of occupied regions.It added that it adhered to the norms of international humanitarian law and conducted strikes exclusively against military targets.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened an investigation into the attack, while the Russian foreign ministry accused Zelensky of \"seeking to intimidate the populations of the reunited Russian regions, who have forever linked their fates with Russia through referendums\".",

    "body": "Italian pasta is set to be spared from high-level US tariffs that the Trump administration had threatened against 13 producers. The move could have resulted in American importers being taxed at a rate greater than the value of the actual pasta itself, and prices rising sharply for US consumers.But on Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry said the proposed rate had now been drastically cut back.In a statement of its own, the US said the 13 firms had addressed many of its concerns. It previously accused the companies of selling their products at unfairly low prices and threatened tariffs of almost 92%.Tariffs are a type of tax paid by a consumer who imports a product. Since returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has unleashed a wide-ranging programme of these taxes, though some have since been softened. The president has sought to address trade practices that he sees as harmful to the US and boost American manufacturing. But economists have consistently warned that such moves can ultimately drive up costs for consumers, worsening cost-of-living issues.In the case of pasta, the US alleged that Italian-made goods were being sold at \"less than normal value\" in the US, which undercut local producers. This pricing policy is sometimes known as dumping.The commerce department was planning to charge a tariff rate of 91.74% for American imports of pasta made by the 13 Italian producers. Given that there is now an underlying 15% tariff on most products bought into the US from the European Union, the plan would have resulted in the rate of tax on pasta exceeding 100% of its value. It sparked fears of consumers experiencing major price increases, although the produce made by the 13 companies represents only a small share of total Italian pasta imported into the US.The plan would have also represented a political headache for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who enjoys a relatively close relationship with Trump among European leaders.On Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry announced that the US had wound back its plan, saying this represented \"an acknowledgement by the US authorities of the constructive co-operation shown by Italian companies\".In the case of one brand, La Molisana, the tariff rate had been dropped as low as 2.26%, the Italian statement added. Others will face slightly higher rates, up to 13.98%.In a statement of their own, which was given to the BBC's US partner CBS News, a US commerce department spokesperson said: \"[Our] post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination. \"Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination.\"Other Trump tariffs that have recently been softened include a planned increase in the tax charged on imports of furniture items - which was postponed for 12 months shortly before it was due to take effect on New Year's Day.And in November, the president signed an order that allowed certain key food products - including coffee, bananas and beef - to escape his tariffs.",

Police sources told the BBC the charges included causing death by dangerous driving.Joshua's personal trainer, Latif Ayodele, and strength coach, Sina Ghami, died on Monday after the vehicle they were travelling in crashed into a stationary truck on a highway in Ogun state, near Lagos.The former heavyweight champion was taken to hospital with injuries after the crash and was discharged on Wednesday.Prosecutors brought four charges against Mr Kayode - causing death by dangerous driving, reckless and negligent driving, driving without due care, and driving without a valid driver's licence, a police source told the BBC.The defendant was granted bail in the sum of 5,000,000 Naira (£2,578) and was remanded pending his bail conditions being met.The case has been adjourned until 20 January.Joshua, 36, was a passenger in a Lexus SUV that collided with a parked truck on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway, in south-west Nigeria, on Monday.Mr Ghami and Mr Ayodele were both pronounced dead at the scene, while Joshua was pictured being helped from the wreckage.Federal Road Safety CorpsNigeria's road safety authority shared this image of the crash site on MondayOgun and Lagos state officials said in a statement that the British boxer was \"heavy hearted\" over the deaths of the two men, who were both his close friends.After being discharged from hospital, Joshua visited the funeral home where their bodies were \"being prepared for repatriation\", the statement added.Just hours before the crash, Joshua posted a video to Instagram of him playing table tennis with Mr Ayodele.On Wednesday, Eddie Hearn, who has been Joshua's promoter for more than a decade, paid tribute to the team members.\"Rest in peace Latz and Sina,\" Hearn posted on Instagram.\"Your energy and loyalty among so many other great qualities will be deeply missed. Praying for strength and guidance for all their family, friends and of course AJ during this very difficult time.\"Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town in Ogun state, near the crash site.He was on his way to visit relatives for New Year celebrations in the town at the time of the crash, a family member told the BBC. The boxer had been spending time in Nigeria after his recent victory over American YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on 19 December.Paul posted on X after the crash: \"Life is much more important than boxing.

    "body": "39 minutes agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesNetiv Haasara is a village just on the northern border of Gaza and was hit during the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023The BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family who survived the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks, after a team of journalists entered their badly-damaged home without permission.A BBC News crew, including International Editor Jeremy Bowen, entered the home of an Israeli family on the Gaza border and filmed inside the property in the days after the deadly attacks.They filmed personal photographs of the family's children at a time when many of their friends and relatives still didn't know whether they had survived, the Jewish News reported. A BBC spokesperson said that while they did not generally comment on specific legal issues they were pleased to have reached an agreement in the case.Tzeela Horenstein said gunmen threw a grenade at her husband Simon during Hamas' attack on the village of Netiv HaAsara early in the morning of 7 October. The couple and their two young children only survived because their home's door twisted and jammed when the attackers tried to blow it out with explosives, she told the Jewish News, who first reported the story.She said: \"Not only did terrorists break into our home and try to murder us, but then the BBC crew entered again, this time with a camera as a weapon, without permission or consent.\"It was another intrusion into our lives. We felt that everything that was still under our control had been taken from us.\"The Jewish News reported that the corporation paid a financial settlement of £28,000 to the family. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "9 hours agoClaire KeenanWatch: Earthquake interrupts Mexico's president during press conferenceAt least two people have died after a powerful earthquake hit southern and central Mexico on Friday.The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the south-western state of Guerrero, which suffered moderate damage.A 50-year-old woman died in Guerrero, the state's governor Evelyn Salgado said, while Clara Brugada, Mexico City's mayor, confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man and said 12 others had been injured in the capital. Mexico is situated in one of the world's most seismically active areas, sitting at the meeting point of four tectonic plates.Late on Friday night, Brugada said power has been restored to \"98% of the failures reported\" in Mexico City.Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, she said, while 34 buildings and five homes were being inspected as a preventative measure.Damage assessments are under way in Mexico City after roads and hospitals were impacted, according to news agency Reuters, while authorities noted various landslides on highways around the Guerrero state. Mexico's seismological service had registered 420 aftershocks by midday local time (18:00 GMT).President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.  In a video capturing the moment, Sheinbaum can be heard saying \"it's shaking\" as an earthquake alert system rings in the background. She then tells the media to \"all get out calmly\". Additional footage shows buildings shaking in Mexico City and cars trembling in Acapulco.Getty ImagesThe inside of a house damaged by the quake in San Marcos, Guerrero state, MexicoAfter hearing the Mexican Seismic Alert System early on Friday, residents and tourists rushed into the streets of Mexico City and Acapulco.The seismic system was put into place following the deadly 1985 earthquake that claimed more than 10,000 lives.In 2017, a 7.1 magnitude quake killed more than 200 people and toppled dozens of buildings in Mexico City.",

    "body": "2 days agoMayeni JonesAfrica correspondent, JohannesburgChristian Parkinson / BBCArnold Ncube was unable to complete his education because he could not prove he was South AfricanMany people may take their birth certificate, or similar official papers, for granted - hidden in a drawer and rarely seeing the light of day - but for those without one, it can lead to a shadow life or an uncertain existence.This is thought to affect millions of people around the world, described as stateless, and 25-year-old South African Arnold Ncube is one of those.Because he has no state-issued documents, washing cars in the backstreets of Thembisa township near Johannesburg is one of the few ways he can make a living.He was born in Johannesburg and his father is South African, qualifying him for citizenship here. But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.Ed Habershon / BBCChristy Chitengu only found out at 17 that she was statelessHuman rights lawyer and advocate Christy Chitengu used to be stateless herself.She only got South African citizenship three years ago with the help of the organisation Lawyers for Human Rights who worked on her case for free.\"I found out I was stateless at the age of 17. My high school principal called me into her office and told me that she didn't have any documents for me and that she didn't understand how I'd gotten into the school,\" she tells the BBC near her home in northern Johannesburg.\"I was born in Johannesburg to two foreign parents [both from Zimbabwe] and at my birth I was given a handwritten South African birth certificate.\"But officials in South Africa need a printed certificate.Christy says that when she found out she was stateless she looked into taking her parents' nationality but it was too late.\"I couldn't claim my Zimbabwean citizenship because by that time I was 16 and they wouldn't allow me to do a late birth registration. Also I would have had to physically leave South Africa to get a Zimbabwean passport and without any documents to leave the country, I wouldn't be allowed back in.\"South Africa has large numbers of undocumented migrants and the authorities and local vigilante groups have been trying to crack down on irregular migration for years.When asked whether giving stateless children citizenship could be seen as a reward to undocumented migrants who give birth in South Africa, Christy disagrees.\"I think citizenship is not a reward. It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being. I think if we look at it through that lens, we realise that there's nothing that we lose by recognising a child who would otherwise not be able to go to primary school or receive healthcare.\"Getty ImagesIn South Africa, an estimated 10,000 people are stateless On several occasions, the BBC contacted the home affairs department, which handles immigration issues in South Africa, to find out how it is tackling the issue of statelessness but got no reply.Statelessness is not just an issue here, it is a huge global problem.There's an estimated 4.5 million stateless people around the world. Some say the figure could even be as high as 15 million.Experts believe tackling the problem requires policy changes, including allowing refugees to register their children where they're born, and giving mothers the right to pass their nationality to their children.\"For us statelessness is not just a legal issue, it's a matter that involves the right to development,\" says Jesus Perez Sanchez who works for the UNHCR.\"That person that's affected by statelessness will not be able to contribute fully to that country that is hosting. So we think that it's important that as a matter of inclusion, all issues of statelessness are addressed so that all these people on the margins of society can contribute fully to society and the economy.\"Back in Thembisa, Arnold is playing football with local children.After years of struggle, he now has a lawyer helping him fight for the papers that prove he belongs here. He wants to go back to school to study computer science. He hopes having documents will lead to a brighter future.Additional reporting by Christian ParkinsonMore from South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" of demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.Meanwhile, an Iranian police spokesman said officers would not allow what he called \"enemies\" to turn \"unrest into chaos\".Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while and another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the country's Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi-Azad warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with a \"decisive response\".This stance was echoed by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said it was \"completely fair\" that shopkeepers protest the economic situation, but that any \"rioters must be put in their place\".Iran's UN Ambassador Amir-Saeid Iravani called on the UN Security Council to condemn Trump's statement in letter to the secretary-general and president of the Security Council on Friday, news agency Reuters reported. \"Iran will exercise its rights decisively and proportionately. The United States of America bears full responsibility for any consequences arising from these unlawful threats and any ensuing escalation,\" he wrote in the letter.",

He led a long life and no doubt fathered many calves,\" said the Amboseli Trust for Elephants in its farewell message.Famed for his long tusks, Craig the elephant was a major attraction at the park near the Tanzanian border. In 2021, he was named an ambassador for the popular Kenyan lager brand Tusker - a name also used for adult male elephants with tusks.The Kenya Wildlife Service described Craig as an \"icon\" of successful conservation.\"Craig was one of the last remaining super tuskers in Africa - a rare class of bull elephants whose two tusks weigh over 45kg (100lb) each. Fewer than a handful remain today, making him a living monument to Africa's natural heritage.\"The wildlife body also said \"Craig was deeply loved for [his] remarkably calm nature\", often \"pausing patiently as visitors photographed and filmed him\". \"Thanks to his many protectors, he died peacefully of natural causes.\"More than two million tourists visited Kenya last year, many of them seeking out wildlife in the country's world-famous national parks.Kenya's tourism sector accounts for 10% of national GDP, officials say.AFP via Getty ImagesCraig the elephant became a brand ambassador for Tusker five years agoYou may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "1 day agoOsmond Chia,Business reporterandDanielle Kaye,Business reporterChina's BYD has overtaken Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of  electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival in annual sales.Tesla car sales dropped by nearly 9% in 2025 to 1.64 million vehicles sold worldwide, the carmaker said on Friday - its second consecutive year of falling car deliveries.Those figures placed Tesla behind BYD, which said on Thursday that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million.The US firm has faced a tough year with a mixed reception to new offerings, unease over Musk's political activities and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.Tesla's car sales fell 16% during the last three months of 2025. The drop was partly due to the repeal of a government subsidy that had helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,570) off the price of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles.Wall Street analysts have recently lowered their Tesla sales estimates for 2026, signalling an increasingly gloomy outlook.Chinese firms such as Geely, MG, and BYD - now the country's largest electric car company - have put pressure on Western rivals by pricing their vehicles below established brands.In October, Tesla responded by launching lower-priced versions of its two best selling models in the US in a bid to boost sales.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package. The deal, which was approved by shareholders in November, could see him getting a payout of as much as $1tn (£740bn).As part of the agreement, Musk also has to sell a million humanoid robots over the next ten years. Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\".Analysts say Tesla's robotaxi and self-driving rollout in 2026, which has helped send its share price to a record high, will be crucial to its overall performance.Though there are big questions surrounding Tesla self-driving ambitions, some remain optimistic. Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities says Tesla will own about 70% of the self-driving market over the next decade \"as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope\" of the firm.Besides Tesla, Musk's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels.Those commitments, along with running US President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) early last year, led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.Musk has since stepped back from his role in the US government.Despite BYD's rise in recent years, its sales growth slowed in 2025 to the weakest rate in five years, in part due to fierce competition in China, its key market.And despite BYD surpassing Tesla when it comes to car sales, the US firm has remained more profitable in recent quarters. Still, BYD remains a global EV powerhouse as its prices often undercut rival carmakers.The Shenzhen-based company's rapid expansion - especially in Latin America, South East Asia and parts of Europe - comes despite many countries imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EVs.In October, BYD said the UK had become its biggest market outside China. The firm said that its sales in Britain surged by 880% in the year to the end of September, driven by strong demand for the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U sports utility vehicle (SUV).",

    "body": "'Living a nightmare': Families of teens missing after ski resort fire desperate for news7 hours agoAleks PhillipsSuppliedThe families of teenagers missing after a fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort are facing an agonising wait for news and appealing for information about their loved ones online.The fire in Crans-Montana was likely caused by sparklers placed on bottles of champagne that came \"too close to the ceiling\", Swiss officials said on Friday.An investigation into the fire will focus on the materials used at the site, the bar's fire safety measures, its capacity and the number of people inside at the time, Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said.Swiss authorities have said it could take days if not weeks to identify the victims of the fire, which killed 40 people and injured another 119. Officials said 113 of the injured had been identified, with authorities still working to identify the other six.In the meantime, families and friends have been taking to social media to appeal for information about their loved ones who were at the bar that night.What we know so farSparklers on champagne bottles likely cause of fireWatch as partygoers try to put out flamesCharlotte Niddam/TikTokAmong the missing is thought to be 15-year-old Charlotte Niddam, a former student at schools in the UK.The Jewish Free School in north-west London called for \"love and prayers\", saying Charlotte had been a student there for two years before her family moved back to France.\"She is loved by so many within JFS and is friends with many in our community,\" it added.A statement from Immanuel College - a private Jewish school in Hertfordshire - widely reported in the UK press said her family had \"asked that we all keep them in our thoughts and prayers during this extremely difficult time\". It added: \"We are all praying for a miracle for Charlotte and the others.\"Crans-Montana's tourism website lists her as a babysitter in the resort during school holidays.Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookSwiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, is among the missingThe whereabouts of Swiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, are currently unknown, his mother Laetitia said.\"I must find my son... it's been 30 hours since [he] disappeared,\" she told the BBC, adding that she wanted his photo \"to be everywhere so that, just in case, someone recognises him, they can call me\".Ms Brodard said that she and Arthur's father had been checking hospitals in Lausanne and Bern, but could not find him, earlier telling local newspaper Le Temps that she was \"living a nightmare.\"Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"SUPPLIEDAchille Barosi was described by his aunt as an avid painterAnother missing Italian national is Achille Osvaldo Giovanni Barosi, 16, who entered the bar at 01:30 local time on New Year's Day to retrieve his jacket and phone. His family have not heard from him since.\"We don't know if he's still alive,\" his aunt Francesca told the BBC World Service's OS programme.She described her nephew, who is enrolled in an art school in Milan, as a beautiful boy and an excellent painter.\"We just want to find him, and that's it.\"The Italian foreign ministry has said six of its citizens remain missing.Italian Golf FederationJunior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, was last heard from around midnight on New Year's Eve, according to his fatherAmong them is Emanuele Galeppini, a 16-year-old junior golfer, originally from Genoa but now living in Dubai.The Italian Golf Federation has said he is dead, without mentioning the fire, paying tribute to a \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father, Edoardo, is quoted by Italian TV channel TG24 as saying his son was at the bar and was last heard from around midnight. An Italian foreign ministry spokesperson has told the BBC that it was not confirming the death yet.Giovanni Tamburi, 16, is also among the missing. His mother, Carla Masiello, from Bologna, told La Repubblica that he had been on holiday with his father but had gone out with friends and ended up at La Constellation.\"A close friend of his told me they ran away after the fire broke out and that he had [his phone] with him, but then at a certain point he couldn't see him anymore,\" she told the newspaper, adding he had been wearing a gold chain with a small Madonna around his neck.Tania Causio, one of his teachers at Porta Saragozza High School, told La Repubblica: \"I've always been struck by his kindness and smile, coupled with great maturity. Every time I walk into class, he asks if I want him to go get me a coffee.\"Lisa Pralong Elisabeth/FacebookFamily of Emilie Pralong face an \"agonising\" wait for information on the 22-year-oldAlso reported missing by family members is Emilie Pralong, 22, who is thought to have been at Le Constellation with several friends who may also be missing.Her grandfather, Pierre, described an \"agonising\" wait for information, telling French broadcaster BFMTV: \"We always hope - we are full of hope. It helps to overcome whatever the hardship.\"While he expressed optimism that she may turn up relatively unharmed in hospital, he said: \"We have to be ready to accept a more difficult situation.

Ninety-six people have been rescued so far and a search is continuing for other passengers who were aboard the shipwrecked vessel that was heading towards Spain's Canary Islands.The perilous journey over the Atlantic Ocean has become an increasingly common route for African migrants trying to reach Europe.Nearly 47,000 people reached the Canary Islands in 2024 and the Spanish non-government organisation Caminando Fronteras estimates more than 9,000 migrants have died trying.After Wednesday's accident, the Gambian Navy launched a search-and-rescue operation, involving several naval vessels and a fishing boat that came to assist, the defence ministry said. The authorities did not say what kind of boat it was but they are typically large wooden canoes not designed for a journey of more than 1,500 km (900 miles) across the Atlantic Ocean. They are often overcrowded. Several of the victims are not Gambian nationals and their identities are still being verified, the defence ministry said.The bodies of seven people have been recovered, while 10 of those rescued are said to be in critical condition and receiving urgent medical care.The Gambia is increasingly being used by West African migrants and asylum seekers as a launchpad for the crossing to Spain's Canary Islands, and then on to mainland Europe.In recent years, the European Union has reached agreements with several North African countries aimed at reducing irregular migration, but this has pushed many migrants to take the longer and more dangerous Atlantic Ocean route.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump says he is in \"perfect\" health, takes more aspirin than doctors recommend, uses makeup to cover bruising on his hands, and does not get regular exercise because he finds it \"boring\".In a lengthy interview about his health, Trump also told The Wall Street Journal that he underwent a CT scan in October, after incorrectly telling reporters that he had undergone a more detailed MRI scan.Trump, 79, is the oldest president inaugurated in US history and his ageing has come under increased scrutiny. He denied to the Journal that he has struggled to hear or that he has fallen asleep at recent White House events. The newspaper said Trump \"expressed irritation about the public debate over his health\".\"Let's talk about health again for the 25th time,\" the president said at the start of an \"impromptu phone call\" as the newspaper prepared to publish a story about his health. Trump said he had been taking larger than recommended doses of aspirin for the last 25 years, even as he said it caused him to bruise easily.\"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,\" Trump said. He takes 325mg of aspirin per day, rather than the 81mg dose sometimes recommended by doctors. \"They'd rather have me take the smaller one,\" Trump said. But he does not want to switch routines after so many years. \"I'm a little superstitious,\" he said. According to guidance from the Mayo Clinic, the risk of heart attack and stroke goes up as you get older and low-dose aspirin helps to prevent both by thinning the blood and preventing clots. But the clinic warns that the risk of bleeding from aspirin also goes up with age. It says the daily dose for aspirin therapy is between 75mg and 325mg.The president also talked about the medical scan he received at Walter Reed National Medical Center, which he previously said was an MRI scan.\"It wasn't an MRI,\" Trump told the Journal. \"It was less than that. It was a scan.\"A doctor for Trump, Navy Capt Sean Barbabella, said in a statement provided to the Journal that Trump had undergone a CT scan, \"to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues\" and that the testing revealed no abnormalities.After Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older people, he was advised to wear compression socks but he declined. \"I didn't like them,\" Trump said, adding that he now gets up from his desk more regularly, which has improved swelling in his legs. Still, the president said he preferred not to do any form of regular exercise, other than golfing.\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"The president maintained that he had not nodded off during public meetings, saying he closed his eyes at times because he finds it \"relaxing\". As for the bruising seen on his hands in some photos, Trump said he now carried makeup in case his hand got \"whacked\".\"I have makeup that's, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds,\" he said.Trump said he did not have trouble with his hearing, and when photographers have taken photos of him when he appears to be sleeping, he said \"sometimes they'll take a picture of me blinking\".\"And they'll catch me with the blink.\"Barbabella said in the statement to the Journal that Trump was in \"exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as Commander in Chief\".Trump's predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, dropped out of the 2024 election race after a stumbling debate with Trump raised questions about his age and mental sharpness.",

    "body": "10 hours agoDoug FaulknerReutersHannibal Gaddafi, now 49, pictured in 2010Hannibal Gaddafi, the youngest son of the deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, has been released by Lebanon after nearly 10 years in detention without trial.The Lebanese authorities seized Mr Gaddafi, now 49, in 2015, accusing him of concealing information about the fate of a Lebanese Shia cleric who disappeared in Libya in 1978, when he was just two. Human rights groups had denounced the accusations.His lawyer told the AFP news agency his $900,000 (£682,938) bail had been paid.Laurent Bayon said: \"It's the end of a nightmare for him that lasted 10 years.\"In October, a judge set a $11m bail against Gaddafi's release but this was reduced last week after an appeal by his defence team, according to AFP.Mr Bayon said his client would leave Lebanon for a \"confidential\" destination.\"If Gaddafi was able to be arbitrarily detained in Lebanon for 10 years, it's because the justice system was not independent,\" Bayon said, according to AFP.In 2015, Mr Gaddafi was briefly abducted by an armed group in Lebanon before being freed. He was later detained by Lebanese authorities.After his father was overthrown by rebels and killed in 2011, he fled to Syria and then had lived under house arrest in Oman with his wife Aline Skaf.Before the fall of his father's regime Mr Gaddafi was known for his lavish lifestyle. The disappearance of Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr in Libya in 1978 has been a source of tension between Libya and Lebanon for decades.Hannibal Gaddafi was only two at the time and held no senior position in Libya as an adult.",

    "description": "Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from jail, three weeks into a five-year prison term for taking part in a criminal conspiracy",
    "body": "Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from jail, three weeks into a five-year prison term for taking part in a criminal conspiracy.He will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France ahead of an appeal trial due to be held next year.On 21 October, the former centre-right president, 70, was sentenced to five years for conspiring to fund his 2007 election campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. His legal team immediately filed a request seeking his release.Writing on social media after the release, Sarkozy said his \"energy is focused solely on the single goal of proving my innocence.\"  \"The truth will prevail... The end of the story is yet to be written.\"Sarkozy's car was seen leaving La Santé prison in Paris just before 15:00 (14:00 GMT), less than an hour-and-a-half after a court agreed to his early release. Soon after, he was seen arriving at his home in western Paris.Christophe Ingrain, one of Sarkozy's lawyers, hailed his client's release as \"a step forward\" and said they would now be preparing for the appeal trial expected in March.One condition of Sarkozy's release is he does not contact any other witnesses in the so-called \"Libyan dossier\" or any justice ministry employees. During his incarceration, he was visited by Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin. The visit prompted 30 French lawyers to file a complaint against Darmanin, highlighting what they said was a conflict of interest as Darmanin was a former colleague and friend of Sarkozy's.Speaking to a court in Paris via video link on Monday morning, Sarkozy described his time in solitary confinement as \"gruelling\" and \"a nightmare\".He said he had never had the \"mad idea\" of asking Gaddafi for money and stated he would \"never admit to something I haven't done\".Sarkozy also paid tribute to prison staff who had made his time in prison \"bearable\". \"They have shown exceptional humanity,\" he said.Sarkozy's wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and two of the former president's sons were present in the courtroom to support him. Sarkozy is the first French ex-leader placed behind bars since World War Two Nazi collaborationist leader Philippe Pétain was jailed for treason in 1945.Since entering prison, Sarkozy has been held in a cell in the isolation wing. He had a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV – for which he paid a monthly €14 (£12) fee – and the right to a small fridge.He also had the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits, as well as written and phone contact – but was in effect in solitary confinement. He was allowed just one hour a day for exercise, which he did by himself in the wing's segregated courtyard.Two bodyguards were stationed in nearby cells, which the interior minister Laurent Nuñez said was due to Sarkozy's status. There was \"obviously a threat against him\", Nuñez said.Sarkozy was president from 2007 to 2012. Ever since he left office, he has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.",

    "body": "British journalist Sami Hamdi is set to be released from US custody two weeks after he was detained by immigration enforcement, his family said on Monday.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested Hamdi, a media commentator and outspoken critic of Israel, last month while he was on a speaking tour in the US.The State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged at the time that Hamdi supports terrorism and poses a threat to national security, while his lawyers have argued he was targeted for criticising Israel and its war in Gaza.Hamdi will be released from ICE detention in the next few days and return to the UK, his representatives say.Hamdi was visiting the US to speak at events for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim advocacy group, when ICE officers arrested him at the San Francisco International Airport on 26 October. His detainment came after the US government revoked Hamdi's visa and criticism from far-right political activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who accused him of supporting terrorists. \"We've said it before, we'll say it again: The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans\", the State Department said of Hamdi at the time he was detained. The BBC has reached out to the US State Department, ICE, and DHS for comment and confirmation of the agreement to release Hamdi.Lawyers for Hamdi and the California chapter of CAIR said in a Monday statement that they welcome an agreement allowing Hamdi to voluntarily return to the UK instead of facing deportation. They said he was targeted for speaking against \"Israel's war crimes against Palestinians\". CAIR said that the immigration charging document filed in Hamdi's case only accuses him of overstaying his visa, which the government revoked without notifying him first. The organisation said the charging document does not identify \"any criminal conduct or security grounds\", which it said was proof that Hamdi was never a danger to the community or to national security.\"It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell. His only real 'offense' was speaking clearly about Israel's genocidal war crimes against Palestinians,\" Hussam Ayloush, the CEO of California's CAIR chapter, said in the news release. When reached for comment, the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) did not confirm details of Hamdi's detainment or release but told the BBC that it was providing consular assistance to a \"British man detained in the USA\". The office said it has also been in touch with the man's family and with local US authorities.\"This decision brings joy to me, his mother, his wife, our entire family, and all of Sami's supporters around the world,\" Hamdi's father, Dr Mohamed Elhachmi Hamdi, wrote on X.\"However, it does not erase the bitterness and shock we all feel over what happened to him in the United States — his arrest and the defamation of his reputation and character by US government-affiliated accounts without any legitimate reason whatsoever.\"",

    "body": "At least 31 inmates have been found dead in a prison in southern Ecuador, including 27 who had been hanged, officials say. Four prisoners were killed and more than 30 injured in clashes between rival gang members in El Oro prison in the city of Machala in the early hours of on Sunday. Hours later, security guards who had been alerted to a fresh outbreak of gang violence found the others who had been hanged on the building's third floor, Ecuador's prison service said.The country's overcrowded prisons have been the scene of a series of deadly riots and gang fights in which hundreds of inmates have been killed in recent years. Ecuador's prison service, known by its initials as Snai, said that the clashes had been triggered by plans to move some of the inmates to a newly-built prison.El Oro prison was the site of another deadly incident in September when 13 inmates and a guard were killed in clashes between rival gangs. Relatives of the prisoners have asked the authorities to step up security inside the prison, including keeping rival gangs separate, whilst residents of Machala have long demanded that the facility, which is located in the city centre, be relocated. Earlier this year, the government of President Daniel Noboa announced the construction of a new maximum security jail in the province of Santa Elena.The new prison, named El Encuentro, is expected to open in late November, and according to the interior minister, will boast all the latest security measures. Prison gangs have for years played a key role in the rise of violent crime in Ecuador and two of them, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, were declared Foreign Terrorist Organisations by the US Department of State in September.",

    "body": "The night an explosion shook Delhi28 minutes agoVikas Pandey and Antriksha PathaniaBBC News, DelhiBBCMohammed Azghar says that his brother has been missing since the blastIt was a busy evening as usual on Monday near the Red Fort metro station in India's capital Delhi when the sound of a loud explosion broke the cacophony.An explosion in a car killed at least eight people and injured more than 20. It was so powerful that several vehicles nearby almost melted, and people could hear the blast from kilometres away.The police are still investigating what caused the blast but the fact that it happened in one of the most secure and busy areas of Delhi has shocked people.On one side is Chandni Chowk - a busy trading and clothing hub that is busier than usual at this time of the year due to the peak wedding season.And on the other side is the 17th Century Red Fort which attracts thousands of tourists every day.Sandwiched between the two is the road where the explosion took place. Within minutes, confusion and alarm spread from the scene to the rest of the city.Some readers may find the details below disturbingMohamed Hafiz, who lives less than 200m from the spot, said his house shook and he and others ran out thinking it was an earthquake.What he saw on the street terrified him: people were running in all directions, cars were on fire, and bodies lay on the road. Some locals were trying to help the injured.\"There was blood everywhere. People were in shock. The scene was too disturbing - I could even see body parts,\" he said.As local media broke the news, fear and panic swept through the city. Police declared a high alert, and neighbouring states quickly followed suit.REUTERS/Adnan AbidiA member from the forensic team investigates the area where the blast took placeAs we entered Delhi from the neighbouring suburb of Noida, we could see a long queue of vehicles at the border as policemen searched them one by one.Everyone - the people in the vehicles and the policemen - looked tense as they all appeared to be in disbelief that something like this had happened in their city for the first time in more than a decade.Beyond the crossing, most roads were deserted as we drove to Lok Nayak Hospital, where the injured had been taken. Outside, a large crowd had gathered behind police cordons. Confusion hung in the air - people searched for answers, and fellow journalists speculated about what might have caused the explosion.Onlookers were mystified and even scared. Rajesh Kumar, who works at a tea shop near the hospital, said he always believed the capital was the safest city in the country.He said that though the blast had shaken him, he still believed that the security forces would soon find out what caused it.\"My family in Uttar Pradesh told me to leave, they panic easily. I am a little worried and shocked but I don't think Delhi has suddenly become unsafe,\" he said.Among the crowd were also several people who were looking for missing family members.One of them was Mohammed Azghar, whose brother was in the area where the blast took place.\"My brother has been missing since the explosion. We haven't had any contact with him,\" he said.\"We've searched around Red Fort, Chandni Chowk, everywhere but we can't find him\"Mr Azghar said his brother used to drive an electric rickshaw. \"The police have confiscated the vehicle, which is fine, we don't mind that. But at least help us find my brother.\"\"I just want some news - good or bad.\"The injured were taken to Lok Nayak Hospital in DelhiAfter visiting the hospital, we drove to the site of the blast. It was jarring to see the roads empty here, as the area is usually teeming with people late into the night.There were only security personnel or journalists around. Officials had relaxed restrictions and journalists could go closer to the site.The scene there told the story of the blast. There were mangled remains of cars, rickshaws and tuk-tuks. Blood stains could still be seen on the road. Some of the vehicles were charred beyond recognition.Some locals had also gathered around. They looked visibly shaken and worried about their immediate future.Ram Singh, who drives a small vehicle to ferry goods from stockrooms to shops in the area, is worried about business being affected.\"I earn daily and I am worried how I might feed my family. I hope a sense of security soon returns. I hope the police will be able to restore trust fairly quickly,\" he said.\"And I hope this never happens in our city ever again. We are shaken but we should overcome this.\"",

    "body": "A female TikToker accused of helping Mali's army has been seized and killed execution-style by suspected jihadists.Mariam Cissé, said to be in her 20s and with over 100,000 TikTok followers, posted videos about life in her Tonka hometown in the northern Timbuktu region and often expressed support for the army.Her death has shocked the nation, which has been battling a jihadist insurgency since 2012. State TV said she had simply wanted to promote her community and support the army through her TikTok posts.Mali is grappling with a fuel blockade imposed on the capital by jihadist groups that has severely disrupted daily life, with the African Union expressing \"deep concern\".Ms Cissé was seized by the suspected jihadists while live-streaming from a market in a neighbouring town, French public radio RFI reported. \"My sister was arrested on Thursday by the jihadists,\" her brother told the AFP news agency, saying they had accused her of \"informing the Malian army of their movements\".Over the weekend she was moved to Tonka by motorbike and shot at the town's Independence Square while her brother was in the crowd, AFP reports.A security source told the agency she had been assassinated because she had been accused of filming jihadists \"for the Malian army\".In some of her TikTok videos, she wears military uniform, with one of her posts captioned Vive Mali (Long Live Mali).Her death comes as the crisis caused by the jihadist blockade has worsened, with schools and universities remaining shut for weeks.The government has suspended learning institutions since last month and said that it would do \"everything possible to address the crisis\" so that they would reopen on Monday.The dire situation has persisted, and on Friday the French foreign ministry advised its citizens to urgently leave the country while commercial flights were available.On Sunday, AU Commission chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said he was concerned about the \"rapid deterioration of the security situation where terrorist groups have imposed blockades, disrupted access to essential supplies, and severely worsened humanitarian conditions for civilian populations\".He condemned the \"deliberate attacks against innocent civilians\" that had caused \"unacceptable loss of lives and heightened instability\".He added that the AU was ready \"to support Mali, as well as all Sahel countries, during this particularly challenging period\".For weeks, Mali has been hit by fuel shortages, especially in the capital Bamako, after militants from an al-Qaeda affiliate imposed a blockade by attacking tankers on major highways.Mali is landlocked, so all fuel supplies are brought in by road from neighbouring states such as Senegal and Ivory Coast.The military seized power in Mali in 2021 and promised to improve security, but the jihadist insurgency has continued and large parts of the north and east of the country remain outside government control.",

    "body": "3 days agoNick ThorpeBudapest, HungaryOn the surface, the Hungarian prime minister's trip was exactly what he went to Washington for: luxuriant praise and an exemption from sanctions on Russian oil, gas and nuclear supplies.And all that just five months out from a difficult election.Look closer, however, and the picture is less clear cut. The US side struck a hard trade deal - and an expensive one for Hungary. And there's no progress on Viktor Orban's biggest headache: ending the war in neighbouring Ukraine, and with it the long shadow the conflict casts over Hungary.Let's look first at Orban's key win - an exemption from US sanctions, which a White House official told the BBC was time-limited to one year, although Péter Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign minister, said would be indefinite.The time span is interesting. Trump clearly wants to help his friend win the election in April. And the exemption even partially dovetails with the European Commission demand to all member states to end the import of Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuel by the end of 2027. What is missing, from an EU perspective, is any political commitment from Orban to meet that demand - a commitment made and fulfilled by the Czech government. And the EU is trying to tighten energy sanctions - to the fury of Hungary and Slovakia.Away from the media spotlight, the Hungarian energy company MOL has been upgrading two of its refineries - Százhalombatta in Hungary and the Slovnaft facility in Bratislava - to process Brent crude instead of the high-sulphur Urals crude which flows through Russian pipelines. On Friday, MOL said 80% of its oil needs could be imported through the Adria pipeline from Croatia, albeit with higher logistical costs and technical risks. So Orban's argument, which so impressed Trump, that Hungary, as a landlocked country, has no alternative to Russian oil may not strictly be true. Overall, Hungary and Slovakia have together paid Russia $13bn (£10bn) for its oil between its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the end of 2024. The one-year window granted by the US is nevertheless a valuable respite for Hungarian households this winter. Orban told pro-government reporters who travelled with him to Washington that otherwise utility bills \"could have gone up by up to three times in December\". Capping those bills by various means has been a central plank of his popularity in Hungary since 2013. Under the US exemption, Hungary can also continue to buy Russian gas through the Turkstream pipeline, which traverses the Balkans, and pay for it in hard currency ($185m in August alone) using a Bulgarian loophole. Orban has agreed to buy LNG from the US worth $600 million, according to Bloomberg.Another key part of the Washington deal is nuclear. Hungary agreed to buy US nuclear fuel rods for its Paks 1 nuclear power station (at a cost of $114m), in parallel to those bought from Russia's Rosatom and France's Framatome.Russian plans to finance and build the nuclear extension, called Paks 2, have been long delayed by technical and licensing issues. The US agreement to lift all nuclear sanctions on Hungary may help restart that project, but thorny problems remain. Hungary has also agreed to buy US technology to extend the short-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at Paks for between $100m and $200m.Perhaps the biggest part of the deal was a Hungarian commitment to buy up to 10 small modular nuclear reactors from the US, for somewhere between $10bn and $20bn. Hungary needs electricity to power the huge Chinese battery plants being built around the country. Smaller nuclear plants are less plagued by building delays, and are easier to licence.Finally, a currency swap deal - similar to a recent US-Argentina deal to prop up the peso - under which US and Hungarian central banks can exchange currency is being discussed.This would mean that in a future financial crisis in Hungary, the US central bank could feed dollars to Budapest, which boosts financial security in Hungary.So in summary, Hungary struck a deal to buy US gas, nuclear energy and unspecified weapons systems in exchange for a temporary waiver from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas. But it failed to get the re-introduction of the US-Hungary dual taxation system, abolished in 2022, which harms mutual trade. And it did not get a new date for a potential Trump-Putin summit in Budapest as part of efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Critics say energy dependence on Russia is being replaced by energy dependence on the US. The Orban government argues it is achieving greater diversity of supply.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKelly Ng,Singapore, Jonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Lulu Luo,Cabanatuan, PhilippinesAt least six people have died after a super typhoon barrelled through the Philippines, mere days after an earlier storm left more than 200 people dead.Super typhoon Fung-wong brought floods and landslides, which caused most of the deaths. It also cut power across entire provinces. It later weakened into a typhoon. More than 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead of it making landfall in the Philippines. It is now heading for Taiwan, where more than 3,000 people have been evacuated.Fung-wong was the 21st typhoon to hit the South East Asian nation this year, at a time where many residents are still struggling to recover from back-to-back natural disasters.Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, slammed into Aurora province on Luzon Sunday night with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h.The Philippines' meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.In Cabanatuan, one of the worst-hit cities, the BBC saw residents rushing into their homes to pull out furniture and pets on Monday, desperate to salvage as many of their possessions possible as water levels rose.Although its wind speeds did not come up to par with some of the strongest storms in the Philippines' history, Fung-wong dumped large amounts of rain on the country, leaving some 4,100 houses either totally destroyed or partially damaged.Cabanatuan resident Mercidita Adriano and her family had trimmed trees near their home last week to prepare for the storm.When the winds and rain intensified, ten of them crowded into a small room, praying throughout the day that the typhoon would spare their house, she told the BBC. Part of their roof was torn off by the heavy rain.Large parts of the country are still under water although the levels have gone down as of Tuesday morning. It comes just days after typhoon Kalmaegi ripped through the same region, leaving tens of thousands of people reeling. And in September, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the province of Cebu.While the Philippines is prone to natural disasters, this series of catastrophes is \"not routine\", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement on Sunday.\"It is a stark reminder of the escalating climate and seismic risks faced by vulnerable nations. Urgent support is needed to scale up relief efforts, prevent further loss of life and support the country as it recovers from this latest disaster,\" it said. ",

    "body": "13 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanada has lost its measles elimination status, said the Pan American Health Organization (Paho) on Monday, after failing to curb an outbreak of the virus for 12 consecutive months.Because Canada is no longer deemed measles-free, the Americas region as a whole has lost its elimination status, although individually the other countries are still considered to have stamped out the disease.The US, however, risks losing its status as well if it does not stop an ongoing outbreak by January. Related cases have now been reported in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina.Canada's outbreak began last October, with health officials attributing it to fewer people being vaccinated against measles.At a news conference on Monday, Paho officials appealed to Canadian governments and the public to ramp up vaccinations, noting that 95% of the population needs to be immunised to stop the spread of measles.\"This loss represents a setback, but it is also reversible,\" said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, the health organisation's director.How Canada became the centre of a measles outbreak in North AmericaMore than 150 children quarantined as US measles cases hit 33-year highThe Public Health Agency of Canada said in its own statement that it is collaborating with Paho and regional health authorities to improve vaccine rates and strengthen data sharing. Prior to Monday, Canada had been declared measles-free for three decades. It can regain its elimination status if it can curb spread of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak for at least 12 months. The country has reported more than 5,000 measles cases in 2025, with most of them in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta. That is three times the 1,681 cases reported in the US, despite Canada's much smaller population. The bulk of the outbreak has been in \"under-vaccinated communities\", Canadian health officials have said. Vaccination rates in Alberta, one of the provinces hit hard by the outbreak, are lower than the 95% threshold, according to provincial data. One region, the South Zone, which includes the province's largest city of Calgary, reported only 68% of children under the age of two were immunised against measles as of 2024.The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.Canadian immunologist Dawn Bowdish told the BBC that there are many reasons behind the low vaccination rates, including lack of access to general practitioners, the absence of a national vaccination registry that Canadians could use to check their immunisation status, and the spread of misinformation. She also noted a lack of public health outreach to communities that have been hesitant or distrustful of vaccines.\"It highlights how many of our systems broke down to get us to this point,\" said Prof Bowdish of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. \"I hope that it will be a wake-up call to policymakers, and that it will be enough of a national embarrassment that we remedy some of those systemic issues,\" she addedThe Americas is the first and only region in the world to have been declared measles-free, starting in 2016. That status was then briefly lifted after outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil. The two countries regained elimination status in 2024, in part through coordinated vaccine efforts where millions were immunised. But measles has since spread again, now in North America. Along with Canada and the United States, Mexico has also seen a surge in cases and now ranks among the top 10 countries with the largest outbreaks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Neither the UK government nor the Indian government are doing anything,\" Harshita's mother Sudesh Kumari says, sobbing into her scarf. \"I want justice for my daughter. Only then will I find peace.\"Harshita's body was found in the boot of a car in Ilford, east London, on 14 November 2024, a day after her family contacted UK police to say they had not heard from her since 10 November.Police believe Harshita, 24, was murdered on that day in Corby, Northamptonshire,  by her husband Pankaj Lamba, who fled to India soon after the killing and is still on the run.The couple, both Indian nationals, had moved from Delhi to the UK, settling in Corby, earlier that year.Northamptonshire PoliceA CCTV picture of the murder suspect Pankaj LambaIn March this year, police in Northamptonshire charged him with murder. He also faces charges of rape, sexual assault and controlling or coercive behaviour.Harshita's sister Sonia Dabas is frustrated with the pace of investigations.\"We are very disappointed with the UK police. Maybe because we are not citizens of the UK, that's why they are not serious about this case. They are sending out a message that foreign nationals are not safe in the UK,\" she told the BBC.Roughly two months before Harshita was killed, on 3 September, she had filed a case of domestic abuse against her husband. He was arrested and later released on bail on condition that he did not harass, pester or intimidate Harshita. The Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) expired four weeks later, on 1 October.Sonia accuses Northamptonshire Police of being negligent in following up on the domestic abuse case. \"That's when Pankaj figured out that the UK police are not really serious about this case and he felt he could get away with murder,\" she says.Four officers of the Northamptonshire Police are being investigated over their handling of Harshita's domestic abuse report and their interaction with her, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).The IOPC told the BBC this week that their investigation was complete and had been shared with Northamptonshire Police. Northamptonshire Police say they have been given until mid-November to respond to the IOPC's findings.Northamptonshire Police said: \"This is an exceptionally complex case and with criminal proceedings now active in the UK, we are unable to go into detail about the investigation at this time. However, we can confirm that the Indian authorities have been made aware through the appropriate channels of the charging decision.\"The Indian government has told the BBC they are in touch with the UK government on the matter, but neither side answered clearly about whether an extradition notice for Pankaj Lamba had been forwarded to the Indian authorities.Ms Brella detailed the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband in a letterHarshita's family also told the BBC that they believe Pankaj Lamba is in India, being shielded by Indian police.\"He has relatives who are policemen. In March this year, he was seen on CCTV footage withdrawing money from a bank. Then how come he's not been found yet? This is all because of corruption,\" says Sonia. The family also says they have information that in the early months of this year, Pankaj was running a shop in Gurgaon, not far from where they live.\"They [the Delhi Police] are just killing time,\" Sonia says.The Delhi Police did not respond to Sonia's accusations. They told the BBC that they have acted on the basis of a dowry complaint filed by Harshita's parents against Mr Lamba and members of his family, including his parents and sister, who were arrested and are now out on bail. The Delhi Police also say they issued public notices earlier this year offering a reward for information about Mr Lamba, and the search for him is still under way.Harshita's mother Sudesh Kumari says she still cannot believe her daughter is gonePankaj Lamba's family home is in the village of Dharauli, about 40 miles (65km) north of Delhi, and not far from Gurgaon where Ms Brella's family believe he was sighted in March. His parents Sudesh and Darshan Lamba didn't want to be interviewed when the BBC visited. But they rejected all the charges against them and their son. They claim they have not had any contact with him since 10 November 2024 – the same day that Harshita's family last had contact with her.For Harshita's father, Satbir Singh Brella, the days are filled with visits to police stations and courts.\"My daughter was so straightforward, and kind hearted. A really terrible thing happened to her,\" he says.Her mother points to the shoes she's wearing. They're Harshita's and were among her possessions from the UK returned to her family by British officials who visited them in July.\"They are tight for me, but I feel close to her when I wear them,\" says Sudesh Kumari. \"Sometimes I feel she's still in the UK, I cannot believe she is gone.\"Additional reporting: Aakriti Thapar, Adnan Bhat, Sanjay Ganguly",

    "body": "24 hours agoParham GhobadiBBC PersianEPAIran - especially its capital, Tehran - is facing an unprecedented drought this autumn, with rainfall at record lows and reservoirs nearly empty. Officials are pleading with citizens to conserve water as the crisis deepens.President Masoud Pezeshkian has warned that if there is not enough rainfall soon, Tehran's water supply could be rationed. But he said that even rationing might not be enough to prevent a disaster.\"If rationing doesn't work,\" Pezeshkian said, \"we may have to evacuate Tehran.\"His comments have prompted criticism in Iranian newspapers and on social media. Former Tehran mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi called the idea \"a joke\" and said \"evacuating Tehran makes no sense at all\".Iran's meteorological officials say no rainfall is expected over the next 10 days.Meanwhile, the water crisis is already affecting daily life in the capital.\"I'm planning to buy water tankers to use for toilets and other necessities,\" a woman in Tehran told BBC Persian.In the summer, Iranian rapper Vafa Ahmadpoor posted a video on social media showing a kitchen tap with no running water.\"It's been four or five hours,\" he said. \"I've bought bottled water just to be able to go to the toilet.\"Dams nearly emptyThe manager of the Latian Dam, one of Tehran's main water sources, says it now holds less than 10% of its capacity. The nearby Karaj Dam — which supplies water to both Tehran and Alborz provinces — is in a similarly dire condition.\"I have never seen this dam so empty since I was born,\" an elderly local resident told Iranian state TV.According to Mohammad-Ali Moallem, the manager of the Karaj Dam, rainfall has plummeted dramatically.\"We had a 92% decrease in rain compared to last year,\" he said. \"We have only eight per cent water in our reservoir — and most of it is unusable and considered 'dead water.'\"Fears of water cutsThe government is now pinning its hopes on late autumn rain, but forecasts are bleak. Iran's Minister of Energy, Abbas Ali Abadi, has warned the situation could soon force authorities to cut water supplies.\"Some nights we might decrease the water flow to zero,\" he said.Officials have also announced plans to penalise households and businesses that consume excessive amounts of water.ABEDIN TAHERKENREH/EPA/ShutterstockThe government has warned that it may have to restrict water supplies if the weather remains dry Pipes, war damage - and a widening crisisIran's energy minister Ali Abadi has said Tehran's water crisis is not only due to a lack of rainfall. He blamed water leakage caused by the capital's century-old water infrastructure and even pointed to the recent 12-day war with Israel.During that conflict, Israel targeted the northern Tehran neighbourhood of Tajrish on 15 June. Afterwards videos showed heavy flooding in the area.The day after the strike, the Israel Defence Forces said it had targeted Iranian military \"command centres\".But the crisis extends far beyond the capital.The head of Iran's National Centre for Climate and Drought Crisis Management, Ahmad Vazifeh, has warned that, apart from Tehran, dams in many other provinces — including West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Markazi — are also in a \"worrying state\", with water levels in the single-digit percentages.In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, officials are sounding the alarm as well.The Governor of Khorasan Razavi Province in north-east Iran, said the water reserves in Mashhad's dams have dropped to \"less than eight percent,\" warning that the province faces a \"mega-challenge of drought.\"CEO of Mashhad's Water and Wastewater Company put the figure even lower.\"The storage level of the city's main dam is below three percent,\" Hossein Esmaeilian said.\"Only three percent of the combined capacity of Mashhad's four water-supplying dams — Torogh, Kardeh, Doosti, and Ardak — remains. Apart from Doosti Dam, the other three are out of operation.\"A crisis long foreseen Iran's water crisis has been decades in the making.Even Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly acknowledged the looming threat — speaking about water shortages in his Nowruz addresses in 2011 and on other occasions in the following years.Yet little has changed.Today, Tehran, Karaj and Mashhad — home to more than 16 million people combined — are facing the real possibility of their taps running dry.",

    "body": "14 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent in RomeA Ukrainian former military officer is on the 10th day of a hunger strike in an Italian prison, where he has accused the authorities of mistreating him to make him confess to blowing up Russia's Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea in 2022.Serhiy Kuznetsov was detained in Italy in August on an arrest warrant from Germany.In a letter shown to the BBC by his lawyer, Mr Kuznetsov says he is being treated as \"criminal no.1\", held in a high-security facility alongside suspected members of so-called Islamic State (IS or Isis). The BBC has contacted the prison, but it has not yet commented.No-one has admitted carrying out the attack on the pipelines carrying Russian gas to Germany.In his first public comment since his arrest, Mr Kuznetsov writes - by hand - that \"the Italians have been cynically ignoring my dietary habits for the past two months\" - a reference to his vegetarian diet.\"They think that these restrictions can affect my position, and make me confess my guilt. But such efforts are futile.\"A relative of Mr Kuznetsov's told me they had tried to deliver special food to the prison, but had been refused - and they were worried that he seemed \"exhausted\".The Nord Stream pipelines were destroyed deep beneath the Baltic Sea at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It was a high profile and controversial attack.Many initially suspected Russian involvement and an attempt by Moscow to blackmail Europe by restricting its energy supplies.But this summer, German prosecutors activated arrest warrants for two of the men they suspect of carrying out the attack: Serhiy Kuznetsov and a second Ukrainian citizen, Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was detained in Poland.German prosecutors have cited charges of \"anti-constitutional sabotage\" as a basis for the extradition requests.A judge in Warsaw ruled against Mr Zhuravlyov's extradition, saying that, if Ukrainians were involved, such an attack would count as legitimate self-defence in a \"bloody, genocidal war\".In Italy, by contrast, a court in Bologna last month approved Serhiy Kuznetsov's extradition in a closed hearing. He is currently appealing against that ruling for a second time.\"He told me he had lost 9kg when I said that his clothes were hanging loosely,\" the Ukrainian's lawyer, Nicola Canestrini, said, after visiting his client on hunger strike.The lawyer said Kuznetsov was refusing all solid food but was \"doing fine and is clear of mind\".Serhiy Kuznetsov complains in his letter about having to exercise in isolation and under armed guard and being subjected to \"maximum restrictions\".His lawyer told the BBC that he himself felt that Mr Kuznetsov had been \"abandoned\" by the Ukrainian government \"like an old boot\".\"He was in the army, so they should know was he there or not? If he was there, they should protect him - if not, they should protect him as well,\" he argues, referring to the attack.Ukrainian officials have always denied any involvement. They declined to comment again recently when approached by the BBC.On Sunday, the human rights ombudsman in Kyiv, Dmytro Lubinets, said an adviser was looking into the case and would check on the prison conditions.In his letter, Mr Kuznetsov says that he understands that his government \"currently has more important matters to attend to, searching for an end to the war\".He ends on a patriotic note, writing: \"I love Ukraine very much and am happy to have the honour of being an officer in its armed forces.\"His final appeal hearing in Italy is due in the next couple of weeks.",

Trump has expressed his support for al-Sharaa, who until recently was designated a terrorist by the US government.Syria will now be the 90th country to join the global coalition, which is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East. Following the meeting, a senior administration official also confirmed that the US Treasury Department, along with the departments of state and commerce, will announce new measures to lift economic restrictions on Syria and provide \"compliance clarity for investors\".As part of the measures, the administration is also issuing an 180-day suspension of the Caesar Act, which since 2019 had sanctioned the former Syrian government.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office several hours after the meeting, Trump said that \"we want to see Syria become a country that's very successful.\" \"And I think this leader can do it,\" he added. \"I really do.\" Diplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although the US will now allow Syria to re-open its embassy in Washington. This is the third meeting between the two leaders, following one in May on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council and a dinner during the UN General Assembly in September. Al-Sharaa's visit to the White House caps a remarkable re-branding for the former jihadist. Not long ago, he led a branch of Al-Qaeda - the group behind the 9/11 attacks and many others - before breaking off ties. Even until this year, he was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed Islamist group which the US officially considered a terrorist organisation until four months ago, with a $10m bounty on his head. The Treasury Department removed al-Sharaa from its \"specially designated global terrorist list\" just last week.But since becoming interim Syrian president, al-Sharaa has worked to soften his public image as he tries to rebuild Syria, with foreign support, following 13 years of war. \"He has had a rough past,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And I think, frankly, if you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance.\" In his interview, al-Sharaa said that he and Trump had not discussed his past, but instead focused on the \"present and the future\" of Syria in which it was a \"geopolitical\" and economic partner of Washington. Al-Sharaa's rule, however, has been marred by killings of members of Syria's Alawite minority, as well as by deadly violence between Sunni Bedouin fighters and Druze militias.He has vowed to root out members of his security forces that have committed human rights violations. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed support for al-Sharaa, referring to him as a \"young, attractive guy\" and a \"fighter\". In June, President Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against Syria, which the White House said would help support the country's \"path to stability and peace\". At the time, the administration said it would monitor the new Syrian government's actions, including \"taking steps toward normalising ties with Israel\" and addressing \"foreign terrorists\" and militant groups operating in the country.

    "body": "4 days agoNick ThorpeBudapest correspondentReuters\"There is a war-opposing network in the world, with two focal points: one of power led by the US president and one of spirit found here with the Holy Father,\" Viktor Orban said last week after meeting Pope Leo at the Vatican.\"We draw strength, motivation, and blessing from both,\" said the Hungarian prime minister.If his ally in the White House, US President Donald Trump, was on his mind, then his thoughts could well have turned to a tricky meeting that awaits him on Friday in Washington.The man Trump has called a \"great leader\", and who has long provoked admiration in Maga circles, suddenly finds himself in an unusual position - at odds with the US president on an issue of critical importance.At the centre of those talks will be new US pressure on Hungary and Slovakia to wean themselves urgently off Russian oil - Trump's latest gambit in his efforts to pressurise Russia into ending its war on Ukraine.Asked recently whether Trump had gone too far in imposing sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies, Orban said \"from a Hungarian point of view, yes\".Orban has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas to advance his own agenda in several ways.He has used it as a weapon to attack Brussels, as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, and as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary. He has promised \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.LISTEN: Nick Thorpe discusses Orban and Trump on Global Story podcastHe will go into this election portraying himself as a safe pair of hands in an increasingly uncertain world. But Orban is trailing in most opinion polls, after his government was shaken by the meteoric rise of opposition Tisza party leader Peter Magyar. The Hungarian PM has also been angered by repeated Ukrainian drone attacks on the Druzhba pipeline this summer, which briefly disrupted supplies to his country.Senior Hungarian officials have been hinting for months that they believe the war in Ukraine could be over by the end of the year - a seemingly absurd claim, until news of a planned summit in Budapest between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin broke last month.But Orban's carefully laid plans began to unravel on 21 October, when the White House announced that the summit  had been called off.Orban's government had been secretly working on the summit plans for months. Balazs Orban, Orban's political director (no relation), enjoys close relations with US Vice-President JD Vance, and is believed to have played an important role.The 'strongman' PM who inspired Trump's playbookOrban accused of using Ukraine spy row in fight for political survivalOrban hopes to persuade Trump to ease the pressure on Hungary at least until the election when the pair meet in Washington.The Hungarian government appears to be counting on the idea that Trump is bored by the war in Ukraine, and wants to turn his back on it if no deal is done soon.Orban has sharply opposed Western military and financial support for Ukraine, and rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato and the EU. He portrays Trump as a pro-peace president, giving short shrift to what he sees as the warmongers of the EU. The climax of the cancelled summit in Budapest would have been the moment he appeared on the balcony of the Carmelite Convent on Castle Hill, overlooking the Danube, flanked by Presidents Trump and Putin. How could Hungarians vote against such an internationally successful leader, he might have asked.In Rome last week, despite US dismissals, Orban insisted the summit would still happen - it was just a question of time. At the weekend, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov quietly suggested the same.Under US pressure, will Orban follow Czech lead?The biggest issue souring US-Hungary relations is oil.In 2024, Hungary even increased the amount of oil it receives through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline from Russia. On 23 October, just as Orban was addressing a rally of his supporters in front of Parliament in Budapest, the US announced sanctions on the two giant Russian oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft.Hungary received 64% of its oil through the Friendship pipeline from Russia, via Belarus and Ukraine, in 2020. By 2024 that figure stood at 80%, or 5 million tonnes a year.The Hungarian government argues that land-based pipelines are the cheapest way to receive oil, and that with no sea coast of its own, it has no alternative. Much smaller quantities are also imported from Kazakhstan, Croatia, Iraq, and Azerbaijan.Another issue is that Russian Urals crude has a higher sulphur content than the Brent crude supplied from elsewhere. The major Hungarian refinery at Szazhalombatta, run by Hungarian oil giant MOL, and the Slovnaft refinery in Slovakia, also run by MOL, are both set up to process mostly Urals crude, not Brent.Within the EU, Orban is now the longest standing leader. Far from leaving the bloc, he wants to remake it in his own image, as a union of sovereign nations. For this, he has also won praise from Putin.But Hungary's argument that it cannot change is undermined by the Czech example. That is a country with a similar population to Hungary, and also landlocked.The Czech Republic traditionally relied heavily on Russian crude for the eight million tonnes of oil it needs a year.Starting in early 2022, following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Czech government under Prime Minister Petr Fiala invested heavily in improving the existing Transalpine pipeline to the Italian port of Trieste.At the same time, its refineries at Kralupy and Litvínov were adapted for Brent crude. In April 2025, the Czech authorities announced proudly that they were no longer receiving a drop of Russian oil.Energy experts say that while MOL, the Hungarian oil giant, is quietly changing its technology, what is missing is a political decision from the government to shift to the Adria pipeline from the Croatian port of Omisalj. There are also disputes between the Croatian company Janaf and MOL - over just how much oil the pipeline could support.ReutersOrban has frequently found himself at odds with the EU, and has won praise from Russian President Vladimir PutinWhen the pair meet, Trump will urge Orban to show some political will to wean itself off Russian supplies. But Orban might see that as a hard decision to explain to Hungarian voters. After arguing for years that Hungary cannot survive without Russian oil and gas, he would lose face if it turns out it can.Matt Whitaker, US ambassador to Nato, said in a Fox News interview last week that Hungary had still \"not made any active steps\" to end its dependence on Russian oil. \"There's a lot of planning our friends in Hungary will have to do,\" he said, and promised US help to Hungary and Croatia to make it happen.As the seagull flies, Omisalj is only 44 miles (70km) from Trieste. Seaborne oil from Kazakhstan, Libya, Azerbaijan, the US and Iraq could soon be flowing through the Adria pipeline to Hungary too.Despite Orban's dire warnings of price hikes, there is no data - so far at least - to suggest that Czech consumers have to pay more.There is nothing his old friend Donald Trump likes more than striking a deal.Orban is about to find out how persuasive the US president can be.",

    "body": "'I thought it was a prank' - How a Brazilian woman became the face of India vote fraud row4 days agoLuiz Fernando Toledo in London and Geeta Pandey & Yogita Limaye in IndiaBBC NewsCongress PartyLarissa Nery has found herself at the centre of a storm since Rahul Gandhi's press conference on WednesdayA Brazilian hairdresser Larissa Nery, who has been making headlines in India this week after her photograph was splashed over the news in an allegation about alleged election fraud, has told the BBC she initially thought it was all a mistake. Or a prank.But then her social media blew up and people started tagging her on Instagram.\"At first it was a few random messages. I thought they were mistaking me for someone else,\" she told the BBC. \"Then they sent me the video where my face appeared on a big screen. I thought it was AI or some joke. But then lots of people started messaging at the same time and I realised it was real.\"Nery, who lives in Belo Horizonte, capital city of southeastern Brazil's Minas Gerais state, and has never been to India, says she searched on Google to understand what was going on.What had happened was the fallout of a press conference by Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday where he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party BJP and the Election Commission (EC) of committing voter fraud in last year's election in Haryana state. The BJP has denied the allegations. Hours after the press conference, in a post on X, the Chief Electoral Officer of Haryana shared a letter they said they had sent to Gandhi in August asking him to sign an oath with the names of ineligible voters \"so that necessary proceedings could be initiated\". They did not respond to the specific allegations he made and did not comment on Nery's case. The BBC has reached out to the poll panel for response.Gandhi has made a series of accusations of \"vote theft\" against the poll panel since early August.In his latest claims, he said his team had looked through the Election Commission's voter list data and found that of the approximately 20 million voters, 2.5 million were irregular entries - including duplicates, bulk voters and invalid addresses. He blamed his party's loss in the Haryana election on this alleged manipulation of the voters' list.To prove his claims, he showed a number of slides on a big screen. One of them showed Gandhi standing in front of a big image of Nery, while another showed a compilation of 22 voters with different names and addresses but all with her photos.BBC speaks to Larissa Nery\"Who is this lady? How old is she? She votes 22 times in Haryana,\" Gandhi said.He explained that a single stock photo of a woman, taken by Brazilian photographer Matheus Ferrero, had been used repeatedly across multiple voter entries under different names. He described Nery as a model who had appeared on the voters' list under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati.The 29-year-old confirmed to the BBC that it was indeed her in the photograph. \"Yes. It is me. Much younger, but it is me. I am the person in the images.\" She clarified that she was a hairdresser and not a model and that the photo was taken in March 2017 when she was 21, just outside her home. The photographer, she said, \"thought I was pretty and asked to take photos of me\".Now years later, all the attention in the past two days from \"people from India, many of them journalists\", has left her scared.\"I became scared. I cannot tell if it is dangerous for me or if speaking about it could harm someone there. I do not know who is right or wrong because I do not know the parties involved,\" she said.\"I did not go to work in the morning because I could not even see messages from my clients. Many journalists were calling me. They found the number of the place where I work. \"I had to remove the salon name from my profile because they were disturbing my workplace. My boss even spoke to me. Some people treat it like a meme, but it is affecting me professionally.\"Matheus Ferrero, who took Nery's photo, is also overwhelmed by the sudden attention. Until recently, he says India meant only Caminho das Índias - the 2009 Brazilian primetime show - to him.He's still trying to make sense of the events of the last few days in a country thousands of miles away.Some people had reached out to him from India a week back, asking him who the woman in the photo was, he told the BBC.\"I didn't reply. I'm not going to give someone's name like that. And I hadn't seen this friend in years,\" he told the BBC. \"I thought it was a scam. I blocked and reported it.\"But since Gandhi's press conference, \"things have exploded\".Congress PartyGandhi said Nery had appeared on the voters' list in Haryana under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati\"People were calling me on Instagram and Facebook. It was terrible. I deactivated my Instagram to try to understand what was going on. Later I googled it and realised what was happening, but at first I had no idea.\"Ferrero says some websites put his pictures next to the Nery's photo without permission. \"People were making memes, like turning it into a game show joke. It's absurd.\"In 2017, Ferrero was just starting out as a photographer when he invited Nery, who he knew, to come out for a photoshoot. Ferrero said he shared the photos on his Facebook and also posted them on Unsplash - a photo website - with her consent.\"The photo blew up… reached around 57 million views,\" he said.He has now deleted the link from his Unsplash account but he sent us screenshots taken earlier that showed other photos of Nery from the same shoot.Why India's Election Commission is facing a test of credibility  \"I deleted them out of fear, because the photos were being misused. I got scared imagining this happening to other people I photographed. I felt invaded. A lot of random people coming at me. You think 'Did I do something wrong?' But I didn't. The platform was open and I uploaded like millions of others.\" He's also now made the original Facebook post with her photos private.\"When you see people entering your Twitter, Facebook, personal Instagram, you panic. The first reaction is to shut everything down and understand later. Some people thought it was funny, like a soap opera, but I felt invaded.\"Neither Ferrero nor Nery have ever been to India and are still trying to understand how something that happened at the other end of the world could turn their lives upside down.We asked Ferrero if all this helped uncover electoral fraud, would that be positive?\"Yes, I think that would be positive. But I don't really know the details,\" he said.Nery who has never left the country says: \"This is far from my reality. I do not even follow elections in Brazil, let alone in another country.\"",

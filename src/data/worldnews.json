But I thought that over the course of a year he had gained some introspection,\" she said.</p><p>Turning to Dogan, she added: \"You don't understand that this was rape. When will you admit that it's a crime? I am ashamed for you.\"</p><p>She also addressed the devastation that had engulfed her family since the trial. </p><p>Her daughter, Caroline Darian, maintains she too was drugged and abused by her father after photos showing her unconscious were found on Pelicot's computer. </p><p>Ms Darian has since spoken about feeling unsupported by her mother. The two are reportedly no longer in contact and Ms Darian was not in court with Gisèle this week.</p><p>\"My family is trying to rebuild itself however it can,\" Gisèle said. \"I hope [Caroline] finds the answers she is looking for. I hope one day we can find each other again.\"</p><p>She also asked to stop being referred to as an icon. \"I am an ordinary woman who dared to open up her trial,\" she said. \"I have become an icon against my will.\"</p><p>As in the original trial, Gisèle ended her statement with a thought for other victims of rape – the majority of whom did not have the wealth of evidence that she had to bring her abusers to court.</p><p>\"I want to say to them to never be ashamed of what was inflicted upon us, because it is not their fault,\" she said.</p></div></article>",

The Brooklyn Nets are owned by the company's chair, Joseph Tsai.</p></div><div><p>It is the first time an NBA fixture has been played in Macau - a special administrative region like Hong Kong, known for its casinos - since 2007.</p><p>The NBA has cast the games as part of efforts to tap into a burgeoning viewership of American basketball in the country, with commissioner Adam Silver telling news agency AFP that there was \"tremendous interest in the NBA throughout China\".</p><p>Analysis by US sports broadcaster ESPN in 2022 suggested the value of NBA China, the arm that manages its operations in the country, was estimated at approximately $5bn (£3.7bn).</p><p>Basketball's popularity in the east Asian nation skyrocketed when Chinese player Yao Ming was drafted by the Houston Rockets in 2002.</p><p>The NBA estimated in 2019 that 300 million people in China played the sport.</p><p>The games could be interpreted as the culmination of a slow but steady reconciliation between the NBA and China, on a backdrop of tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade.</p><p>China suspended NBA broadcasts on Chinese TV channels and streaming platforms after the NBA refused to apologise or discipline then-manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, who posted on social media: \"Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\"</p><p>At the time, the city was engulfed in regular protests over the erosion of free speech and assembly rights, which culminated in China passing a security law to crack down on dissent. Beijing maintains this was necessary to maintain order.</p><p>Mr Morey backpedalled after a backlash from Chinese fans, while the NBA said it was \"regrettable\" that fans in China were upset and acknowledged he had \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China\".</p><p>Since then, NBA games have gradually returned to Chinese TV channels.</p><p>Chinese fans have expressed their excitement about the upcoming games.</p><p>\"We'd been preparing and planning for this two months in advance,\" Lyu Yizhe, from Xiamen, told Reuters in Macau. \"It feels extra special because we're long-time NBA fans - we've been watching since 1998, back in the Michael Jordan and Chicago Bulls era.\"</p><p>Mole Zeng, who travelled from Hangzhou, told the news agency: \"I believe that in the future, as the NBA continues to grow in China, more and more star players will come here to meet us in person.\"</p></div>",

EU parliament votes to ban meat names for plant-based foods</h2><p></p><div><div><p>1 day ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Danai Nesta Kupemba</span><span>BBC News</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The European Parliament (EP) has voted to ban the use of words like \"burger\" or \"steak\" to describe their plant-based variants.</p><p>The 355-247 majority vote is seen as a victory for livestock farmers who say the labels threaten their industry and livelihoods. </p><p>A full ban, however, is not imminent - or even certain - as the proposal needs the backing of the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - as well as the governments of the 27 member countries to become law. </p><p>The plant-based food industry has grown exponentially in recent years, with more people opting for a meat-free lifestyle.</p></div><div><p>\"Let's call a spade a spade,\" Celine Imart, the French member of the parliament who led the initiative was quoted by AFP news agency as saying about plant-based products. </p><p>Marketing plant-based products using meat labels \"is misleading for the consumer\", the member of the conservative EPP group in the EP said. </p><p>Under the proposal, other labels like, \"egg yolk\", \"egg white\" and \"escalope\" would be restricted to products that contain meat. </p><p>The EU has already defined dairy items as products coming from the \"normal mammary secretion\". This includes products like milk, yogurt and cheese. </p><p>Oat milk, for instance, is called an oat drink on European shelves.</p><p>Greens and liberal lawmakers have criticised the now-approved EP text as \"useless\". </p><p>\"While the world is burning, the EPP has nothing better to do this week than to involve us all in a debate about sausages and schnitzel,\"  Anna Cavazzini of Germany's Green Party was quoted by Deutsche Welle as saying. </p><p>Environmentalists have said that the ban would be a setback for sustainability. </p><p>The proposal has also drawn criticism from key food industry voices in Germany - the largest market for plant-based products  in the EU, according to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gfieurope.org/european-plant-based-sales-data/#spain\">report by the Good Food Institute of Europe. </a></p><p>Major German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, fast food joint Burger King and sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1or1KNtCSQrP1zFD4-3xAQAWR8Tbwi0OA/view\">have pushed back against the proposal in a joint open letter</a>. </p><p>They said banning \"familiar terms\" would make it \"more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions\". </p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz - whose party is a key member of the EPP - fully backs the ban. \"A sausage is a sausage. Sausage is not vegan,\" he said recently.</p><p>The French meat industry has also strongly supported the idea. </p><p>Back in 2020, a similar proposal was on the table but it wasn't passed.</p></div>",

The seven others were arrested later.</p><p>\"We continue to work towards their safe and immediate release,\" he said.</p><p>The NGO was suspended on 31 July for three months by the authorities for \"collecting sensitive data without authorisation\". It has been working in the country since 2019.</p><p>On Tuesday, the security minister said that despite being banned, members of the organisation had continued to secretly collect information and hold meetings.</p><p>Mr Neal denied the claim, saying its information-collection activities had ceased on 31 July but its staff remained in Burkina Faso to deal with the detention and meet its contractual commitments.</p><p>A statement by the  organisation emphasised that the information it collects was not confidential and was meant for the safety of humanitarian workers.</p><p>It added that the Burkinabé authorities were \"fully aware\" of their work and mandate and had been co-operating with the authorities.</p><p>Mr Neal said he had tried to engage with the government to address any misunderstandings or concerns.

When strands of DNA - our genetic building blocks - are damaged, a mechanism is triggered whereby another undamaged strand of DNA is used as a template to repair the break.</p><p>The focus of this research was on a particular protein that is involved in that system of damage sensing and repair.</p><p>When a cell senses the damage, one of the substances it produces is a protein called c-GAS. That plays several roles, but what was of interest to these scientists is that in humans, it interferes with and hampers the process by which DNA is knitted back together.</p><p>Scientists think that this interference could promote cancer and shorten our lifespan.</p><p>In naked mole rats though, the researchers found that the exact same protein does the opposite. It helps the body mend strands of DNA and keeps the genetic code in each cell intact.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68528499\">Whale menopause linked to longer lifespan</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61045950\">Mutations across species reveal clue to ageing</a> </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221206-what-naked-mole-rats-can-teach-us-about-treating-cancer\">BBC Future: What naked mole rats can teach us about treating cancer</a></li></ul></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Chicago Tribune via Getty Images The image shows a naked mole rat - a small, pink rodent - in an undeground burrow eating a chunk of corn on the cob. \" /><span>Chicago Tribune via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Naked mole rats live in a network of underground tunnels and chambers </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Professor Gabriel Balmus studies DNA repair and ageing at the University of Cambridge.

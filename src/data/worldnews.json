    "body": "A British grandmother who spent 12 years on death row in Indonesia after being convicted of drug trafficking flew home on Friday, as part of a deal between the UK and Indonesian governments.Lindsay Sandiford, 69, was sentenced to death on the island of Bali in 2013, after she was found with nearly 5kg of cocaine worth £1.6m ($2.1m) when she arrived on a flight from Thailand in 2012.Indonesia has some of the world's most stringent drug laws, but it has freed several high-profile detainees, including the infamous \"Bali Nine\" drug ring, in the past year.Sandiford was repatriated along with another British national Shahab Shahabadi, who had been serving a life sentence for drug smuggling.Their flight left Bali at about 00:30 local time (16:30 GMT Thursday), Indonesian officials said. Sandiford and Shahabadi were both said to be suffering from health problems while in prison. Last month, Indonesia's senior law and human rights minister, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, said Sandiford was \"seriously ill\" while Shahabadi had \"various serious illnesses, including mental health issues\", AFP news agency reported.Sandiford attended a press conference in the Bali prison in a wheelchair hours before she was due to fly home.She had admitted to the offences in 2013, but said she only agreed to carry the cocaine after a drug syndicate threatened to kill her son.The UK's Deputy Ambassador to Indonesia Matthew Downing said Sandiford and Shahabadi were being repatriated on \"humanitarian grounds\". They will be given necessary treatment while being \"governed by the law and procedures of the UK\" upon their return, he added.In December 2024, Indonesia repatriated the five remaining members of the \"Bali Nine\" drug ring, after they served nearly 20 years in Indonesian prisons. The two ringleaders were executed by firing squad in 2015.Also in December, Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was repatriated to the Philippines. The mother of two, who was nearly executed, had always maintained she was tricked into carrying the drugs found on her.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMimi Swaby and James ChaterPeru's Congress has voted to declare Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum as persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision comes days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt. Betssy Chávez denies allegations that she played a role in ousted Peruvian President Pedro Castillo's plan to dissolve congress. She has taken refuge in the Mexican embassy in Lima.Mexico says it has offered Chávez asylum in accordance with international law, and rejected Peru's accusation that it was an \"unfriendly act\". The declaration - passed in a 63-33 vote in the Peruvian Congress - marks the latest escalation in worsening ties between the two Latin American nations. During the vote, Peruvian legislators also accused the Mexican leader of having close ties to drug trafficking - a claim they gave no evidence for.Chávez had been imprisoned in June 2023 over her alleged role in Castillo's plan to dissolve Peru's legislative body. She was released by a judge on bail in September and has denied the charges against her.Prosecutors are seeking a 25-year sentence for Chávez.Peruvian Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela told the Reuters news agency that legal experts were reviewing the 1954 Caracas Convention on diplomatic asylum, which Mexico used to justify their offer of asylum.Earlier this week, de Zela said Mexico had tried to \"portray the authors of the coup attempt as victims\".\"In reality, Peruvians live and want to continue living in democracy, as recognised by all countries in the world, with the sole and lonely exception of Mexico,\" he added.Peru also accused Mexico of \"repeated instances in which the current and former presidents of that country have interfered in Peru's internal affairs\".In 2022, Lima expelled Mexico's ambassador following its decision to grant asylum to Castillo's wife and children following his arrest.Last September, the Foreign Relations Committee of Peru's Congress proposed declaring Sheinbaum a persona non grata for failing to condemn Castillo's attempted coup and advocating for his release.",

    "body": "17 hours agoKathryn Armstrong and David GrittenIsrael has confirmed Hamas handed over the remains of deceased Tanzanian hostage Joshua Mollel on Wednesday under the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal.The Israeli prime minister's office said that, following the completion of forensic tests at the National Centre of Forensic Medicine, the foreign ministry had informed the 21-year-old student's family.Mollel was undertaking an agricultural internship in southern Israel when Hamas-led gunmen attacked on 7 October 2023. He was killed at Kibbutz Nahal Oz and his body was then taken by fighters.His return means six deceased hostages - five Israelis and one Thai - are still in Gaza.\"The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Mollel family and all the families of the fallen hostages,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said in a statement on Thursday.It also stressed that Hamas was required to return all the deceased hostages under the ceasefire deal, adding that Israeli authorities would \"spare no effort until we return all of the fallen hostages, every last one of them.\"The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel said: \"Amid their grief and the knowledge that their hearts will never fully heal, Joshua's return offers some comfort to a family that has endured unbearable uncertainty for over two years.\"Before handing over Mollel's remains to the Red Cross in Gaza on Wednesday evening, Hamas's military wing said that it had recovered a hostage's body in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.In recent days, Israel has allowed members of Hamas and Red Cross staff to search for remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.The body of Israel-US soldier Staff Sgt Itay Chen was found there on Tuesday.Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.Five of the six dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis and one is Thai.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the 7 October 2023 attack, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "49 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton says he has sued Roblox over \"flagrantly ignoring\" safety laws and \"deceiving parents\" about the dangers the online video gaming platform poses to young people.In a social media post he said Roblox is a \"breeding ground for predators\", accusing Roblox of putting \"pixel paedophiles and corporate profit\" over the safety of Texas children.The lawsuit adds to the legal challenges related to online safety and internet predators faced by the gaming giant, which has tens of millions of daily active users.Roblox told the BBC it is \"disappointed\" that it is being sued based on \"misrepresentations and sensationalised claims\".The company's spokesperson said in a statement that it shares Paxton's commitment to keeping children safe online and that it has introduced measures to remove bad actors and protect its users.Roblox, which is especially popular with children, operates a massive online platform where users can play solo or with friends.The platform has been marketed to families and offers a host of educational games that teach subjects including coding, physics and problem-solving.Users are also offered developer tools to build their own games - a feature that has resulted in some violent and sexual content surfacing on Roblox.Another feature that allows users to enter servers and interact with strangers online has also been criticised for potentially exposing young players to dangerous individuals. Parents and children have raised concerns about Roblox, saying that they have seen distressing content or suffered abuse on the platform.Paxton called on the company to do more to protect children from \"sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen\".\"Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law,\" he said in a statement on X.Texas joins the US states of Kentucky and Louisiana which have also sued Roblox over potential harms to children.Dave Baszucki, Roblox's chief executive, previously told the BBC that parents who are uncomfortable with their children playing games on the platform should not let them use it.\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" Mr Baszucki said.Roblox has introduced features in recent years to tighten age verification and safety for young players.The platform said it is rolling out technology to estimate a player's age using video selfies and other measures before they are allowed to communicate on Roblox.Last year, Roblox also announced it will block under-13s from messaging others on the platform unless a parent or guardian grants permission.Roblox has been banned in some countries, including Turkey over concerns about child exploitation.The platform came under scrutiny in Singapore in 2023 after the government said that a self-radicalised teenager had joined ISIS-themed servers on Roblox.The 16-year-old, who was one of two young people who were detained at the time, had joined Roblox servers that replicated real-life conflict zones such as those in Syria, the Singapore government said.",

    "body": "11 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorFour senior figures in the Greek coastguard, including its current commander, are to face criminal prosecution for negligent manslaughter in connection with a 2023 migrant boat disaster in which up to 650 people are thought to have drowned.The fishing boat Adriana went down off the Greek coast near Pylos. Survivors told the BBC that the vessel capsized after coastguards made a botched attempt to tow it.Greek authorities have always denied any wrongdoing over the shipwreck.Now a prosecutor at the naval appeal court in Piraeus has recommended that the current head of the Hellenic coastguard, Vice Adm Tryfon Kontizas, and three other senior officers should go on trial.Among the charges cited by the court of appeal are manslaughter by negligence in international waters but within Greece's rescue zone, exposure by negligence with a legal obligation to rescue people that resulted in death and repeated exposure by omission of other people to danger.The Adriana had left Libya for Italy in June 2023 and was monitored by a Greek patrol vessel for some 15 hours off Pylos before it went down. Some of the 104 survivors later revealed that a coastguard vessel had caused the boat to sink by towing the boat away too fast when the boat was unbalanced.Although only 82 bodies were recovered, hundreds more people are believed to have died.Prosecutors at the maritime court in Piraeus decided earlier this year that 17 members of the Greek coastguard should face charges, including the captain of the coastguard ship, the-then head of the coastguard Vice Adm Giorgos Alexandrakis and the supervisor of the national search and rescue centre.However, they cleared Tryfon Kontizas and three other senior officers of blame. Vice Adm Kontizas had been appointed coastguard chief a few weeks before the court's decision.That decision not to prosecute the four officers was then challenged by lawyers for survivors and relatives of the victims.Greece has always maintained it fully respects human rights and has rescued more than 250,000 people at sea in the past decade.",

    "body": "11 hours agoNatalie ShermanAFP via Getty ImagesBoeing will avoid a criminal charge in the US linked to two deadly 737 Max crashes, after a court granted a request from the US government to dismiss the criminal case.In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor said he \"disagreed\" that dropping the charge was in the public interest but said his concerns did not give him sufficient reason to deny the proposal. The decision marks a major win for Boeing, which had agreed to plead guilty to the charge last year after the government accused it of violating a settlement related to the crashes.The dismissal had been opposed by some of the families of those killed in the accidents, who had sought to hold Boeing accountable at trial.Lawyer Paul Cassell, who represents some of the families, said he intended to appeal against the ruling.\"We believe that the courts don't have to stand silently by while an injustice is perpetrated,\" he said in a statement.In his decision on Thursday, Mr O'Connor said the government's concerns about taking the charge to trial were \"unserious\"and he did not believe the new deal reached between the government and Boeing would \"secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public\".But he said the government was presumed to be acting in \"good faith\" and he did not have the authority to override the request. The Department of Justice (DOJ) defended its agreement, noting that it had met \"extensively\" with the crash victims' families, which had expressed \"a broad set of views regarding the resolution\".\"Rather than allow for protracted litigation, this agreement provides finality for the victims and requires Boeing to act now,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are confident that this resolution is the most just outcome.\"Boeing said it was committed to the agreement struck with the DOJ. \"We are also committed to continuing the significant efforts we have made as a company to strengthen our safety, quality, and compliance programs,\" the company said in a statement.The decision marks the latest twist in a long-running legal battle stemming from two major 737 Max accidents in late 2018 off Indonesia and in Ethiopia in early 2019, which killed 346 people. The US subsequently charged Boeing with one count of criminal fraud conspiracy, accusing Boeing of deliberately concealing from regulators key information about its flight control software, which was implicated in the crashes. The firm admitted to the allegations but avoided prosecution with a 2021 deal in which it paid $2.5bn in fines and compensation and pledged to improve safety standards and compliance programmes.The case was reopened last year, after an incident in which an unused door fell off a 737 Max early in flight. The DOJ accused Boeing of having breached the terms of the original settlement.In 2024, under the Biden administration, the DOJ proposed a new deal in which Boeing would plead guilty to the fraud charge, pay a further fine of $243m and agree to a court-appointed monitor overseeing its operations for a set period.But Mr O'Connor rejected that deal last December, in part due to concerns over how the monitor would be selected.A new settlement put forward by prosecutors this year dropped the criminal charge, a black mark for Boeing that could have complicated its dealings with the government as a contractor. It still required the company to hire an \"independent compliance consultant\" and make $1.1bn financial commitments, including another $243m in penalties as well as additional compensation to family members of those killed in the crashes.In explaining their decision to dismiss the charge, prosecutors said Boeing had made \"meaningful progress\" this year in its anti-fraud and conspiracy programmes.

    "body": "5 hours agoIan AikmanReutersThe UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US resolution to lift sanctions on Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa ahead of his White House visit next week.Sharaa was named transitional president after leading a rebel offensive that ousted Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending 13 years of civil war. Washington's ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz said the UN had sent a \"strong political signal\" that recognised Syria was in a \"new era\" since Assad was deposed.Sharaa was under UN sanctions as the leader of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was formerly linked to al-Qaeda. The US removed HTS from a list of foreign terror groups in July.The UN also removed sanctions on Syrian Interior Minister Anas Khattab.Syria's foreign minister welcomed the removal of the sanctions, posting on social media: \"Syria expresses its appreciation to the United States and to friendly nations for their support of Syria and its people.\"Sharaa's White House visit on Monday comes after US President Donald Trump said the Syrian leader had made \"good progress\" towards bringing peace to the war-torn country.The pair met for the first time in May, when Trump visited Riyadh on a tour of the Middle East.After that meeting, the US president described Sharaa as a \"tough guy\" with a \"very strong past\".His Islamist group HTS was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria until he severed ties in 2016.ReutersAfter the meeting, Trump said Sharaa had \"a real shot at pulling it together\"Monday's visit will not be Sharaa's first trip to the US this year. In September, he became the first Syrian leader to address the UN General Assembly in New York in almost 60 years.In his speech, he said Syria was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world\" and expressed solidarity with the people of Gaza.",

    "description": "A Ukrainian court has handed down the first jail sentence for life against a Russian soldier accused of killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war.Dmitry Kur",
    "body": "A Ukrainian court has handed down the first jail sentence for life against a Russian soldier accused of killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war.Dmitry Kurashov, 27, was found guilty of shooting dead Vitalii Hodniuk, a veteran 41-year-old Ukrainian soldier who had surrendered following capture in 2024.Ukraine's national police said that \"expert reports, witness testimony and video footage from the scene confirmed that the Russian soldier deliberately killed the POW on the orders of his commanders, who had instructed troops not to take Ukrainian soldiers captive\".In a months-long trial which began earlier this year, the court heard how Kurashov's unit stormed a Ukrainian position in the region of Zaporizhzhia on the morning of 6 January 2024.The prosecution said that although Hodniuk crawled out of a dugout unarmed and surrendered, Kurashov shot him point-blank with several aimed AK-47 shots – a violation of the laws of war.Kurashov and the rest of his unit were later overpowered by Ukrainian forces and taken as prisoners of war.Kurashov initially pleaded guilty but later retracted, saying he had only done so to expedite the trial in the hope that he would be released in a prisoner swap. He maintained it was a Russian medic – who later died – who fired the shots that killed Hodniuk.His version was refuted by other members of his own unit who were later captured by Ukrainian troops and were also being held as prisoners of war.They said they saw Hodniuk emerge from the foxhole unarmed with his hands up after Kurashov called for Ukrainians to come out of their foxholes and surrender.Although they did not witness the shooting because there were explosions at the same moment, all three said nobody but Kurashov had been around when they heard the gunshots. One said the medic accused by Kurashov was not present on the scene when the killing occurred.Kurashov himself never testified. According to court reporters, his lawyer Anna Karpenko said her client \"sincerely repented\" and that he believed he had simply been following orders from above not to take any prisoners.Nikita Manevsky, the prosecutor who pushed for the harshest sentence, had argued Kurashov had showed \"no remorse\" and \"nothing but indifference\" during the trial.Earlier this year, Kurashov told the BBC he had joined the Storm V assault unit in exchange for early release from a remote penal colony in Russia where he was serving a sentence for theft. Representatives from the Russian military told the convicts that if they joined the army and went to Ukraine their sentences would be expunged, Kurashov said.The recruitment of prisoners to fight in the war in Ukraine – which Russia calls a \"special military operation\" – is a known practice.Convicts who sign up are sent to join the generally poorly trained Storm V penal military units. Its troops are often employed to join \"meat grinder\" assaults on the front line – a tactic which sees waves of soldiers push forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery.In May the Ukrainian intelligence directorate (HUR) said it had recorded more than 150 cases of battlefield executions of POWs by Russian soldiers since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Last year the head of the War Department at the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office told the BBC that executions of prisoners of war by Russian forces had \"clear signs of being part of a policy\" as they were happening across vast areas.Ukrainian forces have also been accused of executing Russian prisoners of war, but the number of such claims has been much smaller.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLily Jamali,in San Francisco and Aoife Walsh,in WashingtonNancy Pelosi has announced her retirement from Congress, ending a decades-long career that saw the California Democrat become one of the most powerful figures in US politics.In a video message on Thursday, Pelosi said she will not be seeking re-election to Congress at the end of her term in January 2027.It marks the end of a storied political career: Pelosi, 85, became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House and led her party in the lower chamber of Congress from 2003 until 2023.\"We have made history, we have made progress,\" Pelosi said in her message. \"We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"\"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" Pelosi added.Pelosi was first elected to Congress to represent San Francisco in 1987 aged 47, and quickly rose through the ranks. She was elected by her party to be speaker of the House in 2007, becoming the first woman to serve in that role. She served until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the lower chamber, before returning to the speaker's chair from 2019 to 2023.Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line to the presidency.In that role, Pelosi played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents during her long career on Capitol Hill.She is widely credited with marshalling the passage of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation, as well as bills to address infrastructure and climate change during Joe Biden's presidency.Pelosi also directly challenged Donald Trump throughout his presidency, famously ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address behind his back.By then she was also a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform.She led two impeachment efforts against Trump - the first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. Trump was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Biden, and of using military aid as leverage. He was later acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.The second was in 2021, when he was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. That effort ultimately failed and Trump was acquitted once again.On Thursday, when asked about Pelosi's retirement, Trump said she was \"an evil woman\".\"I'm glad she's retiring. I think she did the country a great service by retiring,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I think she was a tremendous liability for the country.\"After Trump's first term, Pelosi worked with Biden to shepherd much of his legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins.In less than two years, Democrats in the House pushed through a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage.She was succeeded as Democratic leader in the House by New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries in 2022.Since leaving her speakership, she has remained a major political influence. Most recently, she played a key role in helping to pass Proposition 50 in California -  a state redistricting effort aimed at flipping five House seats to Democrats during the midterms in 2026.",

    "body": "1 day agoWill GrantCentral America and Cuba correspondentMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. In the video, a man approaches her from behind and attempts to kiss her on the neck and place his hands on her body. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken. The offender has been arrested.\"My view is, if I don't file a complaint, what will happen to other Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what will happen to all women in our country?\" Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday.\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" she said. \"I have experienced it before, when I wasn't president, when I was a student.\"She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.\"A line must be drawn,\" she said.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman. Femicide is also a huge problem in Mexico, with a staggering 98% of gender-based murders estimated to go unpunished.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events. On occasion, that has presented security concerns for her team. However, she confirmed in her new conference she had no intention of changing her policy of interacting with her supporters.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels. Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.Since taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump.",

    "body": "16 hours agoBethany Bell,Vienna and Yogita Limaye,South Asia and Afghanistan correspondentOpium farming in Afghanistan has dropped significantly following a ban imposed by the Taliban government in 2022, the United Nations said.The total area of land for growing opium poppy shrank 20% since last year, while the amount of opium has fallen by 32% over the same period, the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime said in a survey.Afghanistan used to produce more than 80% of the world's opium, with heroin made from Afghan opium making up 95% of the market in Europe.But after retaking power the Taliban banned the practice in April 2022, saying opium was harmful and went against their religious beliefs. The UN said most farmers continued to observe the ban despite \"severe economic challenges\".Many Afghan farmers are harvesting cereals, but poppy - from which opium, the key ingredient for the drug heroin can be extracted - continues to be \"far more profitable\" than legitimate crops, the UNODC noted.Over 40% of available farmland has remained fallow because of the lack of profitable alternatives, limited agricultural outputs and, adverse climate conditions it added.The total area under opium poppy cultivation this year was estimated at 10,200 hectares, mostly in the north-east of the country, with Badakhshan province accounting for the largest share. Before the 2022 ban, more than 200,000 hectares were under poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. Four provinces with opium poppy cultivation in 2024 (Balkh, Farah, Laghman, Uruzgan) were declared opium poppy-free in 2025. \"The near elimination of cultivation from traditional strongholds illustrates the scale and durability of the ban on opium poppy cultivation,\" the survey said.The Taliban's efforts to destroy opium fields occasionally sparked violent resistance from the farmers, particularly in the north-east, the UNODC said, noting that casualties were reported during clashes in several districts of Badakhshan.But the vast majority of Afghan farmers adhere to the ban issued by the Taliban's supreme leader. However, farmers say they lack support to grow alternative crops - as a result, they have to choose between poverty or punishment.\"If we violate the ban, we face prison. If we comply, we face destitution,\" one unnamed farmer in Helmand province told BBC Pashto this summer.\"If there's no money, then I'll grow poppies again.\"Poppy fields are no longer openly visible in Helmand, but they do still exist.Another farmer showed BBC Pashto around his small walled-off poppy field in front of his house in a remote village. He's risking jail, but he said he had no option.\"What should I do? I'm forced to do this - I have nothing else. I can't even provide food for my family.\"While opium is in decline, trafficking in synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine have risen since the ban, the UNODC said. Seizures of such drugs in and around Afghanistan was 50% higher in late 2024 compared with the previous year. Organised crime groups favour synthetic drugs which are easier to produce and less vulnerable to climate shocks, the UNODC said.",

    "body": "12 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanada's top court has refused to hear an appeal to stop the cull of hundreds of ostriches at a farm in British Columbia, leaving the farmers with few legal options to prevent it.The cull was ordered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) late last year after two birds tested positive for avian flu, following an outbreak that killed dozens of the animals.Universal Ostrich Farms has fought the order since, and the case has attracted international attention including from senior White House officials who have criticised it as an example of government overreach. The Supreme Court of Canada's decision means the cull can now legally go ahead. It is unclear, however, if the farmers will try to pursue other avenues to save the birds, such as asking the federal government to reconsider the order.Ostriches facing cull at Canada farm find unexpected alliesIn a statement following the Supreme Court dismissal on Thursday, the CFIA said it will be \"moving forward\" with the cull, but did not provide a timeline on when.It added that it \"expects the ostrich farm owners and supporters\" to respect the legal decision. Katie Pasitney, whose family owns the farm, reacted tearfully in a video posted on Facebook. \"Shame on you Canada,\" she said. \"Please pray for a miracle in the next hour for our family, for these animals outside,\" she added.The farmers have argued that the ostriches should be spared and used instead for scientific research, noting those that remain had survived the avian flu outbreak that killed 69 of the flock.The CFIA, on the other hand, has said that the birds should be killed because their exposure to the flu poses a risk to wildlife and humans. They also dispute the claim that the surviving birds have developed immunity to the virus.Lower courts have sided with the CFIA's order to cull the birds.The ostriches remain on the farm, but have been under the custody of the food inspection agency since late September. More than 60 protesters had gathered at the farm early on Thursday morning as the Supreme Court released its decision. The legal battle has also attracted support from US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who met with CFIA officials in May to ask that the agency study the birds instead.Dr Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, offered to re-home the birds on his Florida ranch.Another supporter has been New York grocery billionaire John Catsimadtidis, who has spoken frequently about the plight of the ostriches on his radio show and revealed he was helping to fund the farm's legal battle.",

    "body": "COP30: World leaders take aim at Trump for climate inaction9 hours agoEsme Stallard,Climate and science reporter, BBC News and Matt McGrath,Environment correspondent, BBC NewsPablo Porciuncula/AFPBrazilian President Lula warned of \"extremist forces\" when he addressed world leaders at the global climate summitUS President Donald Trump has been criticised by world leaders for his stance on climate change, ahead of the global COP30 summit.President Trump, who is not attending the meeting in the Amazonian city of Belém, was called a liar by the leaders of Colombia and Chile for his rejection of climate science.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the waning political support on climate change. He said it had been a unity issue internationally and in the UK but \"today sadly that consensus is gone\".Over the next two weeks countries will try and negotiate a new deal on climate change, with a particular focus on channelling more money to forest protection.Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit.And while Trump isn't attending this meeting in Belém, his views on climate change are certainly on the minds of many of the other leaders present.Speaking at the UN in September, the US president said that climate change was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\".He said: \"The entire globalist concept, asking successful industrialised nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies, must be rejected completely and totally.\"Without naming the US leader, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil warned on Thursday of \"extremist forces that fabricate fake news and are condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming\".The leaders of Chile and Colombia went further, calling the US president a liar, and asking other countries to ignore US efforts to move away from climate action.Maisa Rojas, Chile's environment minister, told the BBC: \"The science is very clear. It is very important not to falsify the truth.\"But while Trump-bashing went down well with the audience, getting agreement on new steps to tackle warming is proving much harder.Only a few dozen leaders have turned up here in Belém, and a majority of countries have failed to submit new plans to cut carbon emissions, the root cause of rising temperatures.AFP via Getty ImagesOuteiro Port in Belém was recently expanded to accommodate cruise ships acting as \"floating hotels\" for COP30 delegatesDespite Starmer acknowledging that global political support for the climate movement is waning, he told the gathering of those that were present: \"My message is that the UK is all-in.\"However, on Wednesday night, in a blow to the Brazilian hosts, the UK chose to opt out of its flagship $125bn (£95bn) fund to support the world's rainforests.President Lula hoped that $25bn could be raised for the Tropical Forests Forever Facility from public sources – mainly from developed countries like the UK – to support governments and communities protecting the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin.The protection of these ecosystems is crucial for tackling climate change - they cover just 6% of the world's land, yet store billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases and host half of the planet's species.The move by the UK has come as a surprise as it had been heavily involved in the fund's design, and launched a global commitment for countries to halt deforestation by 2030 when it hosted the COP summit in Glasgow in 2021.Lord Zach Goldsmith, who worked on the issue when he was former environment minister, told the BBC's PM programme: \"The assumption was that the UK would be a leading participant and at the last minute the UK has walked away.

    "body": "Attackers have boarded a ship off the coast of Somalia after firing machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades at the vessel, according to a UK maritime agency.Greek shipping company Latsco Marine Management confirmed the attack on a ship carrying gasoline, saying all the ship's 24 crew were \"safe and accounted for\" and \"we remain in close contact with them\".The crew have taken shelter in the ship's fortified safe room, Reuters news agency quotes an official from maritime security company Diaplous as saying. European Union naval forces operating in the area have been asked for assistance, Reuters says.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) says the raid happened about 560 nautical miles south-east of the Somali town of Eyl. \"The Master of a vessel has reported being approached by one small craft on its stern. The small craft fired small arms and RPGs towards the vessel,\" UKMTO said in a statement.Private security firm Ambrey said the attackers were probably Somali pirates, who have been active in the region in recent days.According to Latsco, the attack on the Malta-registered vessel occurred at around 11:48 local time (08:48GMT). \"[Latsco] has activated its emergency response team and is coordinating with the relevant authorities to ensure the continued safety and welfare of the crew,\" it said.The vessel, named Hellas Aphrodite, was built in 2016, and was en route from Sikka, India, to Durban, South Africa, it saidThe attack comes amid a resurgence of piracy in the region, which had declined after peaking more than a decade ago.There were at least seven reported incidents last year, and several fishing vessels have already been seized by pirates this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau.",

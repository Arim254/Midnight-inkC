    "body": "11 hours agoTabby WilsonLuca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoAn Italian mayor has apologised to the family of opera star Luciano Pavarotti after the town of Pesaro encased a statue honouring the late singer within a Christmas ice rink. The singer's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, told local media that she was \"angry and upset\" at what she called the decision to \"ridicule\" her late husband. The temporary ice rink was constructed in the centre of the town's piazza, leaving Pavrotti's statue knee-deep in ice and surrounded by perspex walls. In response, Mayor Andrea Biancani said that he didn't mean to offend anyone, and admitted that his council had \"made a mistake\".Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoBefore it was opened on 29 November, Biancani posted a doctored image of Pavarotti's statue playing ice hockey with the hashtag #DaiUnCinqueAPavarotti, which translates to \"Give a high-five to Pavarotti\".\"I didn't expect a town would allow this treatment of the memory and the image of a person who made Italy great around the world,\" Ms Mantovani told local outlet Il Resto del Carlino. She accused the council of making a \"poorly executed, absurd decision\". The life-size bronze statue was officially unveiled in Pesaro in April 2024, with Ms Mantovani and the couple's daughter, Alice, in attendance. The couple often holidayed in Pesaro, where Pavarotti had a villa and was an honorary citizen.Alamy/Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoOpera star Luciano Pavarotti's statue seen earlier in the year in the town of Pesaro (left), and in November, surrounded by an ice rink (right).Biancini told Il Resto del Carlino, which nicknamed the incident \"Pavarotti on Ice\", that when plans for the ice rink were initially presented to him, he was assured that the Pavarotti statue would not be touched and that it was only later that he found out designers had been forced to alter their construction. He said it would not be possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this late stage, but insisted that it would \"not happen again\".Pavarotti was an Italian tenor, and is widely known as one of the most successful opera stars of all time.His performances in the Three Tenors concerts were seen around the world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.His final performance was at the opening of the Winter Olympics in Turin in February 2006.He died the following year at the age of 71, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Pavarotti left behind four daughters from his two marriages. Ms Mantovani was his second wife. She remarried, to financial advisor Alberto Tinarelli, in 2020. ",

    "body": "Pope Leo XIV led a silent prayer at the site of the Beirut port explosion and demanded justice for its victims, as he wrapped up his three-day visit to Lebanon.He also met some relatives of the 218 people who were killed by the massive blast on 4 August 2020, which devastated a large part of the capital.Later, the Pope said he was \"deeply moved\" by his visit to the port and shared \"the thirst for truth and justice, of so many families, of an entire country\".No-one has yet been held accountable for the disaster, which happened when a fire triggered the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely at a port warehouse for almost six years.It is widely believed that officials and politicians were aware of the combustible chemical's existence and the danger it posed but that they failed to secure, remove or destroy it.Victims' relatives and activists say the domestic investigation into the disaster has been hampered by the political leadership's efforts to shield those responsible from scrutiny.Cecile Roukoz, whose brother Joseph was killed, said the Pope's visit to the memorial was \"very important\". \"We know that he raises his voice for justice, and we need justice for our brothers and all the victims of this explosion,\" she added.Tatiana Hasrouty, who lost her father Ghassan in the blast, said: \"He's trying to help us find the truth in some sort of way, in his way, maybe in praying and maybe in just looking at us... We, the families, now, after five years, we need people to look at us.\"After praying at the blast site, the Pope celebrated the final Mass of his trip in front of an estimated 150,000 people gathered on Beirut's waterfront.Addressing the crowd, he lamented that the beauty of Lebanon had been \"overshadowed by poverty and suffering, the wounds that have marked your history\".But he appealed to the country's diverse communities to unite to solve its problems.\"Let us cast off the armour of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\" he said. \"A Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognise each other as brothers and sisters.\"Since the last papal visit in 2012, the small country has been plagued by multiple crises.In 2019, the country suffered one of the worst economic depressions recorded in modern times, which pushed millions into poverty.It was followed by mass anti-government protests, the coronavirus pandemic, and then the Beirut port explosion.Political paralysis prevented the country from passing the economic and structural reforms demanded by foreign donors in return for billions of dollars in aid.Lebanon was later devastated by the 13-month war between the Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement and Israel, which killed 4,000 Lebanese and 120 Israelis.A ceasefire ended the conflict a year ago, but Israel has continued to attack targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, accusing the Iran-backed group of trying to rearm.",

    "body": "Multinational retail giant Costco has sued the US government to secure a full refund of import duties if the Supreme Court rejects President Donald Trump's authority to impose tariffs without congressional approval.Costco's lawsuit urges the federal trade court to declare Trump's 'emergency' tariffs illegal, an authority the president says he has under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Two lower courts have already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority by using emergency powers to impose tariffs. The case has now reached the Supreme Court, and several companies are trying to protect their rights to refunds should the justices strike down the tariffs.In the lawsuit filed over the Thanksgiving holiday, Costco said its business had suffered because of the tariffs and was concerned it wouldn't get its money back even if the apex court upheld previous rulings.Lawyers for Costco said a \"separate action is necessary\" as a refund is not guaranteed  \"in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief\".The world's third-largest retailer didn't say how much it was seeking back but trade data from the US customs agency shows importers like Costco have already paid about $90 billion in IEEPA-related tariffs as of late September.Costco brought the suit to the US Court of International Trade ahead of a 15 December 2025 deadline after which it would struggle to recoup any funds paid to the government.In May, that court was the first to rule that Trump's tariffs were unlawful, a decision that has been subsequently affirmed by the US Court of Appeals. At the hearing last month, Supreme Court judges appeared sceptical of the president's authority to impose the levies without congressional approval.Trump administration lawyers have argued in court the emergency powers give the president the authority to impose the global tariffs. The administration has warned an unfavourable ruling will restrict its ability to negotiate with countries and the treasury will lose billions already collected.\"The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNBC in a statement. \"The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" the statement added.Last month, the president said the US was \"taking in Trillions of Dollars\" in tariffs and promised \"a dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone\".",

    "body": "One of the four sons of notorious Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán has pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges in a US court. Joaquín Guzmán López's guilty plea on Monday comes after US prosecutors pledged last May to not pursue the death penalty against him.   Lopez, 39, is a member of Los Chapitos, a cell made up of El Chapo's children, including his brother Ovidio, who pleaded guilty in July to drug trafficking, firearms and money laundering charges.Their father, who was one of the founders of the Sinaloa drugs cartel, is serving a life sentence in Colorado.US prosecutors say the brothers rose to become the leaders of the drug cartel after the arrest of their father. Lopez was arrested last year alongside cartel boss Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada after landing a private plane in Texas.Officials have said that Lopez helped trick Zambada into boarding the plane, having led him to believe he was travelling to northern Mexico to look at prospective properties for clandestine airstrips.As part of the plea deal, Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the US.Fentanyl, which is over 50 times more powerful than heroin, is the leading cause of deaths in the US for people aged 18 to 45. Lopez's guilty plea comes as the Trump administration faces pressure from Congress to justify its missile strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea. Trump has moved to designate the cartels as terrorist organisations, and says the strikes are needed to prevent drug deaths in the US. Critics have called them extra-judicial killings, and say they may violate international treaties governing war.Meanwhile on Sunday, Mexico authorities announced that they had killed a well-known drug trafficker who was wanted in the US. Pedro \"Pichon\" Inzunza Coronel, who was one of the country's top fentanyl traffickers, was involved in multiple crimes, including \"murders, kidnappings, torture, and violent debt collection for drug trafficking\", according to US Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson.\"These results reflect what our nations can achieve when they work together against those who pose a threat to our citizens,\" Johnson wrote on X.",

    "body": "10 hours agoYvette TanVideo shows speed fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseHong Kong's leader John Lee has ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of a devastating fire that killed at least 151 people.Last Wednesday, seven of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex - which had been undergoing extensive renovations - went up in flames. Investigators have since found that a protective netting used around the buildings failed to meet flame retardant standards. At least 13 people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter, including the directors of a construction company. The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years and the death toll could rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.Chief Executive Lee said that the committee would be led by a judge and would conduct \"comprehensive reform\", adding that he would work to \"prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future\". Asked at a news conference why he should keep his job, Mr Lee acknowledged that reform was needed but failed to directly address the question. \"Yes, it is a tragedy, it is a big fire. Yes, we need reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plucked,\" he said. The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Getty ImagesThe fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 yearsSeparately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry into the fire. An online petition gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day before its contents were wiped.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police, according to local media reports.Asked about this on Tuesday, Lee did not address the question directly but said that \"criminals that commit offences must be taken to justice\". \"I emphasise I will not tolerate any crimes, particularly crimes that exploit the tragedy that we are facing now.\"Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticised the reported arrests.\"Now is the time for the Hong Kong authorities to transparently investigate the causes of the devastating fire...rather than silencing those who ask legitimate questions,\" Amnesty International said.Getty ImagesChief executive John Lee said that the committee would be led by a judgeWang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died.",

It is feared that children are among the missing.The landslide was caused by \"erosion\" of the bank of the Ucayali River - the headwater of the Amazon - the country's National Emergency Operations Center said on X.Some 50 people were on board one of the boats, according to news agency AFP.Rescue operations have been hindered by the fast-flowing river waters, a navy official told AFP.Children, teachers and doctors were among the passengers, the Reuters news agency reports, citing Andina.Authorities are working with families gathered at the scene of the disaster to try to determine exactly how many people still need to be found.One of the boats had departed Pucallpa to the north on Sunday and was travelling towards the riverside communities of Caco Macaya, Curiaca del Caco, and Pueblo Nuevo del Caco, local media reports.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJames ChaterandLaura GozziRussian Presidential Press ServiceVladimir Putin was filmed visiting a command post at the weekend, in video released on the eve of Steve Witkoff's visit to MoscowRussian President Vladimir Putin will meet US special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on Tuesday, after the White House said it was \"very optimistic\" about reaching a deal to end the Ukraine war.US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has acted as an outside adviser in diplomatic talks, is also expected to attend.The summit comes after two days of negotiations in Florida between Ukrainian and US officials, including Witkoff and Kushner, aimed at refining a US-backed peace plan which had been viewed as favourable to Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the talks as \"constructive\", but said there were \"some tough issues that still have to be worked through\".Witkoff's meeting with Putin will be during the second half of Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Speaking after a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday, Zelensky said Kyiv's priorities in peace talks were maintaining Ukraine's sovereignty and securing strong security guarantees.Zelensky said the \"territorial issue is the most difficult\" element of the peace deal, with the Kremlin continuing to push for Ukraine to cede territory in the east which it still controls - something Kyiv has long-maintained it will never do.The talks in Moscow on Tuesday come hours after Russian officials claimed to have captured the key strategic town of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, known in Russian as Krasnoarmeysk, and the north-eastern Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk.Ukrainian officials made no acknowledgement that either city had fallen to Russia and open-source intelligence projects monitoring the front lines of the war suggested neither Vovchansk nor Pokrovsk had yet been fully captured by the Russian army. The head of Ukraine's centre for countering disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said it seemed Russia's main aim was to ensure all the pressure in the US peace plan was put on Ukraine.Russia has spent almost a year and a half trying to capture Pokrovsk and released a video showing Putin visiting a command post at the weekend in which he was quoted as saying Russia had made progress in \"an important area, we all understand just how important\".Ahead of his trip to Moscow, Witkoff also held talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Zelensky and Ukraine's new chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, while several key European leaders virtually joined the Zelensky-Macron meeting. Speaking on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the draft peace deal had \"been very much refined\", adding: \"I think the administration feels very optimistic.\" She continued: \"But as for the details, I will let the negotiators negotiate. But we do feel quite good, and we're hopeful that this war can finally come to an end.\"Last week, Putin said he had seen a draft peace plan proposed by the US, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.However, Kremlin officials later cast doubt over whether it would accept the proposal after Kyiv and European allies said they had secured changes to it.The initial US-Russia draft peace plan circulated in November sparked consternation in Kyiv and around Europe.As well as being heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, it also dictated how several billion in frozen Russian assets currently held in European financial institutions should be invested, as well as setting the terms for Ukrainian market access in Europe.Speaking on Monday, Macron said there was currently \"no finalised peace plan to speak of\", and insisted that any such proposal could only be worked out with input from Ukraine and Europe.Macron said the question of territorial concessions could \"only be finalised by President Zelensky\", and pointed out that questions around frozen Russian assets, security guarantees, and Ukraine's accession to the EU needed to involve European nations.The French leader also praised efforts by the Trump administration to end the conflict, which began in 2014 with Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, followed by a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said this week could be \"pivotal\", but that Moscow only wanted to negotiate \"with those who are just offering them something on top of what they already have\". She continued: \"I'm afraid all the pressure will be put on the weaker side because that is the easier way to stop this war when Ukraine surrenders, but this is not in anybody's interest.\"In recent months Moscow has at times appeared to engage with US attempts to mediate an agreement to end the war, but several of its demands directly counter Ukraine's sovereignty and are seen as unacceptable by Kyiv.While the question of territory is the major sticking point, the issue of security guarantees for Kyiv has also proved contentious.Kyiv and its European partners are keen for Ukraine to be given security guarantees - such as Nato membership - that would protect it from being attacked again.But Russia vehemently opposes this and Trump has also ruled out allowing Ukraine to join the military alliance.",

    "body": "A Zambian-American influencer and political vlogger has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hate speech for making insulting remarks about Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema.Zambian-born Ethel Chisono Edwards, who also holds US citizenship and works as an estate agent in New York, has a large following across various social media accounts. Known as \"One Boss Lady\", she has become renowned for her rants about the president over the last two years.The 42-year-old was arrested at Zambia's main airport three months ago after arriving to attend her grandmother's funeral.She pleaded guilty in a magistrate's court in the capital, Lusaka, and apologised to the president for her comments.But Magistrate Webster Milumbe said the court had a duty to send a strong warning, noting that hate speech had become increasingly common.Edwards, who has been in police custody since her arrest, was convicted under the Cyber Security Act and the Cyber Crimes Act - new legislation that came into effect this year.She admitted to using a computer system to publish the offensive statements, acknowledged having no lawful excuse and conceded that her words were motivated by hatred.Her lawyer, Joseph Katati, described Edwards as a remorseful first offender with potential.He went on to detail how she was a breadwinner and philanthropist who sponsored a Zambian girls' football team that would suffer from her imprisonment.He also delivered a detailed public apology on her behalf.\"I want to unreservedly apologise to the president, Mr Hakainde Hichilema, his family, and the nation of Zambia for the words that I uttered against the president and for the negative effects that those words may have caused to the president, his family, and the nation at large,\" it said.Throughout her court appearances, Edwards appeared subdued - a stark contrast to her online persona.The magistrate acknowledged Mr Katati's plea for mitigation and said Edwards's sentence would be effective from the time of her arrest.Mr Katati said he had not yet received instructions from his client on whether to appeal against the sentence.The jailing of the influencer has divided opinion in Zambia, with some saying it was necessary while others arguing that it violates freedom of speech.Hichilema, who came to office in 2021, has abolished criminal defamation laws against the president, but Zambians still face prosecution under other laws.In September, two men were sentenced to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hichilema.",

    "body": "18 hours agoMadeline HalpertandNada Tawfik,North America correspondentLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan a year ago this week, appeared in court on Monday as his lawyers challenge the admissibility of key evidence in his case.Mr Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal murder charges, which carry the possibility of the death penalty.The pre-trial hearing could last several days, as defence attorneys are expected to call a host of witnesses, including from Pennsylvania, where he was arrested at a McDonald's.In September a judge threw out state terrorism-related murder charges against Mr Mangione, arguing prosecutors had failed to establish evidence to justify them.Mr Mangione's legal team is now hoping to convince a judge to exclude evidence including a gun and a notebook in which prosecutors say he set out a motive.The defendant was arrested days after he allegedly shot Mr Thompson, a father of two, as he was walking into an investors' conference on a busy Manhattan street on 4 December 2024.A date for either of his trials has not yet been set.Walking into court on Monday, Mr Mangione wore a grey suit and shirt, and court employees removed his hand restraints before he sat, as his lawyers requested.This week's hearing focuses on whether prosecutors illegally obtained evidence from Mr Mangione when they arrested him in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and whether it should be excluded as a result.Defence attorneys are seeking to suppress some of Mr Mangione's statements he made to police after being arrested - including allegedly giving them a false name.They argue he did so before police read him his rights, including the right to remain silent.His attorneys are also hoping to exclude from the trial a 9mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing, as well as writings found in Mr Mangione's backpack.Listen: The Mangione Trial podcastProsecutors have alleged that Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family who graduated from an Ivy League university - had written in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\".But defence lawyers are arguing his backpack was searched without a warrant, and the items found in it should be excluded for that reason.Eliminating those two critical pieces of evidence - that point to a murder weapon and motive - would be a big win for Mr Mangione's legal team.But the chances of that happening are \"virtually non existent\", said Dmitriy Shakhnevich, a criminal defence attorney in New York.He said that's because there are a number of exceptions to constitutional rules that law enforcement must obtain a warrant for personal searches, including some that may cover this case.\"In a case like this where there's a manhunt for a violent suspect who committed this alleged crime in plain view in New York City, nobody's getting a warrant,\" Mr Shakhnevich said. \"When they get him, they're going to search him.\"Prosecutors say they have other key evidence against the defendant, including DNA or fingerprints on items discarded near the crime scene.Mr Mangione's attorneys are probably aware of the long odds of getting evidence excluded, Mr Shakhnevich said.He added that the main reason why defence lawyers hold these type of proceedings is to preview trial testimony from law enforcement.So far, the court has heard from New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Sgt Chris McLaughlin, who was asked to review surveillance images from after the shooting.Prosecutors in court also played CCTV showing the killing. A worker who handled security cameras at the McDonald's in Altoona testified as well.Prosecutors played a 911 call for the court from a manager at the fast food restaurant who said customers had told her one patron looked like the suspect in Mr Thompson's killing. The manager said she had looked online for pictures of him but could only make out Mr Mangione's eyebrows as he ate in the restaurant, since he wore a hat and face mask. The court also heard from a correctional officer at the jail where Mr Mangione was being held who said he appeared \"unbothered and logical\" as the two discussed literature and health care, though Mr Mangione did not give his opinion on the latter topic. The officer said Mr Mangione was placed under a high level of security because they wanted to avoid an \"Epstein-style situation\", a reference to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while in a federal detention centre. Mr Shakhnevich said the legal team wants to have this type of information from witnesses so they can be aware of what people might say at trial, and to be on the lookout for any inconsistencies in their statements.\"The benefit of the hearing is that you get to have law enforcement officials testify, and you get to bind them to testimony for a trial later on,\" he said.Mr Mangione's legal team has also been pushing to bar the federal government from seeking the death penalty.They have said comments from high-ranking officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, accusing Mr Mangione of the murder have prejudiced his case, which they claim is motivated by politics.",

    "body": "23 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéAFP via Getty ImagesAnicet Ekane's  family was given little explanation - \"his wife was just presented the corpse\", his lawyer told the BBCLeft-wing Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane has died in detention, five weeks after he was arrested, his lawyers and party have announced.Ekane, 74, was among the leaders of an opposition coalition who endorsed Issa Tchiroma Bakary in October's presidential election.Tchiroma Bakary says he was the rightful winner of the poll, officially won by 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya. Tchiroma Bakary has since fled to The Gambia.No official cause of Ekane's death has been announced. His party has accused the authorities of denying him access to his medication - a charge the government has denied.According to a spokesman for Ekane's African Movement for New Independence and Democracy (Manidem) party, Ekane died on Monday morning at a military medical facility, after his health worsened over the weekend.\"We have no clarification... His wife had been called to come and when she found herself there, she was just presented the corpse of her husband,\" he said.He added that the family later took the corpse to the mortuary.Defence ministry spokesman Capt Cyrille Serge Atonfack said the Manidem leader had died from illness, but did not give any further details.\"The deceased, who suffered from various chronic pathologies, had been interned at the Military Medical Centre of the National Gendarmerie,\" he said, adding that the politician had been well taken care of by doctors since his arrest on 24 October.Minister of Communication and government spokesperson René Emmanuel Sadi later expressed the government's condolences to Ekane's family, as well as the Manidem party.He also said that Ekane had received proper medical attention from both his personal doctors and those at the military hospital where he was admitted, adding that an investigation had been launched to determine the exact circumstances of Ekane's death.Renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna described Ekane's death as \"the extinguishing of a fierce and passionate flame\" that burned for democratic emancipation.Muna said in a statement that Ekane had informed him of his ill-health during their last conversation.\"One would have thought that basic humanity, the fundamental presumption of innocence, and the undeniable evidence of his failing health would have compelled his release to his family and the care of the medical experts who knew his condition,\" Muna said.According to Ekane's lawyers, he was accused of hostility against the state, incitement to revolt, and calls for insurrection.\"He was never presented before a judge or charged with any misdemeanour,\" said one of his lawyers, Hippolyte Meli, in a statement on social media, describing the detention of the Manidem party leader as \"illegal\".In recent weeks, rumours had circulated that the opposition figure had died, and Ekane's party members had demanded to see him \"dead or alive\".His death has sent shockwaves across the nation, with supporters gathering at the party headquarters in Douala to grieve. Others have taken to venting their anger online.Manidem says its premises have been surrounded by security forces.AFP via Getty ImagesOpposition protesters accused the ruling party of rigging the elections to ensure Paul Biya stayed in powerEkane initially endorsed another vibrant opposition figure, Maurice Kamto, for the presidential election. But Kamto, who endured a long detention after disputing the previous election in 2018, had his candidacy rejected upfront this time by both the electoral body, Elecam, and the Constitutional Council, on the grounds that the party had endorsed more than one candidate.Ekane and other politicians went on to create the Union for Change Coalition, which named former government spokesman Tchiroma Bakary as its candidate.At least 48 people were killed by Cameroon's security forces during protests against the re-election of President Biya, according to the UN.This included a number of people shot dead near Tchiroma Bakary's residence in the city of Garoua. He later claimed that snipers had been stationed at the house across from his, and were \"firing at point-blank range at the people\".The Cameroonian government has denied any wrongdoing.

    "body": "2 days agoAleem MaqboolReligion Editor, Travelling with the Pope, BeirutGetty ImagesThe Pope arrived in Beirut on Sunday  Pope Leo XIV has arrived in Beirut a week after Israeli air strikes hit the Lebanese capital.For a man known for being measured and careful in what he does, it seems quite the statement to land in a country so affected by conflict in what is his first foreign trip.The Pope has already spent three days in Turkey and, watching his diplomacy at close quarters, we are learning a little more about how he intends to carry out his duties as both spiritual leader and head of state of Vatican City.Pope Leo's interactions with journalists are gentle and softly spoken, and his words always appear thought out and deliberate.His predecessor, Pope Francis, often spoke at length to reporters, sometimes very passionately and from the heart.But sometimes that meant his aides had the job of risk management, having to explain statements that appeared to be a departure from what the Pope had previously said or a diplomatic faux pas.ReutersAt the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in IstanbulPope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church.Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself.At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears.In a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith.As a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements.Standing next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\".At an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\"On the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state.\"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.Getty ImagesPeople of all major faiths turned out in southern Beirut with papal flags Pope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people.The Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\". There is no question that in Lebanon in particular there has been a great deal of anticipation.\"It means a lot to me. He could have visited other countries, but he gave priority to Lebanon while it is still at war,\" Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, leader of the Maronite Catholic Church (to which most Lebanese Christians belong) told the BBC.\"He brings hope when the Lebanese feel abandoned and we feel uplifted,\" he says.The Pope's visit here provides a boost to the third of the country that is estimated to be Christian, but all Lebanese have been granted a two-day national holiday and those from all major faiths have welcomed him.Even Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim political party and militia considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and US, conveyed its greetings.In an open letter, the group talked of a \"full welcome\" and \"deep appreciation\" for the Pope's \"honourable presence\". Among the Lebanese and Vatican flags being waved as his motorcade drove from Beirut's airport, there were Hezbollah flags too.While in Lebanon, Pope Leo will meet Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, but also other local Christian, Muslim and Druze leaders.He has certainly cast himself as a bridge-builder; between peoples, faiths, Christian denominations and even closer to home, becoming pope as he did at a time when divisions between progressive and traditionalist Catholics appeared to be growing.Getty ImagesWith President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in AnkaraThere are, of course, limits to the ambition of togetherness. In Turkey when the Pope wanted to bring together different Christian traditions to celebrate a time when they had all been united, the Russian Orthodox Church did not send a representative.There will always be criticism. Some were left disappointed that the Pope did not use his visit to Turkey to deliver a message to Erdogan about the suppression of opposition or jailing of journalists.Some in Lebanon are angered that Pope Leo is not visiting those most directly affected by war.\"No one has even asked about us,\" said Geryes Jabbour, who is from the Christian village of Sarda, near the Israeli border.\"We are worn out, we have been set back decades, but we are not even on the Pope's mind,\" he said, echoing the views of some others in southern Lebanon.That day in May, Leo may have suddenly (and for him perhaps unexpectedly) acquired one of the most powerful moral platforms, but on a human level, he is still a man from South Side Chicago growing into a role where one wrong step could have huge ramifications.Unlike Pope Francis he does not seem like a man looking to shake things up quickly, but Pope Leo has shown on his first foreign trip that he is finding his voice on the world stage.Additional reporting by Ghaith Solh",

    "body": "4 hours agoIan AikmanAFP via Getty ImagesProtests took place in cities across Bulgaria - the biggest for decadesBulgaria's government has said it will withdraw its controversial 2026 budget plan after massive rallies were held against it on Monday night in the capital, Sofia, and in cities across the country.Tens of thousands of people joined protests to oppose the draft budget, which they said attempted to hide widespread government corruption. Clashes with the police broke out when some masked protesters attacked the offices of the ruling conservative Gerb party and also of the DPS party in Sofia.The government said on Tuesday it would abandon the plan, which also would have raised taxes. It comes after similar protests broke out last week, when the initial plan was submitted to parliament.Next year's budget will be Bulgaria's first delivered in euros, as it joins the eurozone on 1 January.Public opinion over adopting the euro is divided, with some fearing it could lead to sharp inflation in what is one of the EU's poorest countries.Protests against government corruption have been frequent in Bulgaria, which has been run by short-lived governments since 2020, after protests sparked the end of another Gerb-led coalition.ReutersA drone view shows protesters gathered outside the parliament in SofiaMonday's rally is thought to have been the largest in the capital for years, with protesters filling a huge square in front of parliament carrying signs urging a change in leadership.Significant protests also took place in Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas, Blagoevgrad and other cities.Critics of the abandoned budget plan said they were protesting against increases to social security contributions and taxes on dividends to finance higher spending, as well as state corruption.\"We are here to protest for our future. We want to be a European country, not one ruled by corruption and the mafia,\" Ventsislava Vasileva, a 21-year-old student, told the AFP news agency.More than 70 people were arrested after masked protesters attacked the offices of political parties, according to Sofia's interior affairs chief Lyubomir Nikolov.ReutersProtesters in Sofia were seen setting bins on fire, breaking windows, and clashing with police in riot gearBulgarian President Rumen Radev called for an end to the violence, which he dismissed as a \"provocation by the mafia\", and urged everyone to obey the law. \"Provocations do not change the fact: Bulgarians said NO to this government,\" he said in a post on Facebook before the budget was abandoned. \"There is only one way out: resignation and early elections.\"As head of state, Radev holds a largely ceremonial role.The government is currently led by Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov, who formed a minority coalition in January 2025 after the centre-right Gerb party won October 2024's elections without a clear majority.A parliamentary committee had adopted the budget plan on 18 November, but Zhelyazkov later said he would delay it to allow for more time to consult opposition parties, trade unions and employers.After Monday's protests, Zhelyazkov's government issued a short statement saying it would withdraw its draft proposals and start a new budget procedure. Bulgaria's opposition party has called for the government to resign, saying abandoning the draft budget is not enough, according to local media.",

    "description": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor ",
    "body": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor for New Jersey - a ruling likely to affect scores of criminal cases in the state.The president handpicked Habba for the role of US attorney this year, but a district court rejected her nomination, so the Trump administration installed her in a role that allowed her to fill in on an acting basis.The appellate judges found on Monday that this tactic, which bypassed confirmation by the US Senate, violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba is the second Trump-appointed prosecutor to be disqualified in recent weeks.\"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" one of the appellate judges, Judge Michael Fisher, wrote in Monday's ruling disqualifying Habba. The BBC has contacted Habba's office, the White House, and the Department of Justice for comment. In a joint statement, three lawyers who had challenged Habba's authority - Abbe David Lowell, Gerry Krovatin, and Norm Eisen - wrote that this marks \"the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions\".The statement continued: \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported US Attorneys wherever appropriate.\"Habba, 41, first joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. She went on to represent Trump in his hush-money trial in New York last year, when he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction. Before Habba took on the role of US Attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as \"unwavering in her loyalty\" and a \"tireless advocate for justice\".Monday's ruling may force the justice department to find a new prosecutor to supervise federal criminal cases in New Jersey. The appellate court's decision came after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey argued that the prosecutor's appointment was unlawful, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.A federal judge ruled in their favour in August. That order had been on hold while the appeals court heard the case. Habba is not the first Trump-appointed US prosecutor to face a legal challenge. A federal judge last week dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that the US attorney in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed as interim US attorney in Virginia. In October, a US district judge disqualified Bill Essayli from his role as acting US attorney for the Southern District of California, finding that he had stayed in the temporary post longer than the law allowed. But the judge allowed Essayli to continue overseeing the office - the most populous US federal judicial district, serving around 19 million people - in his role as first assistant US attorney. Defence attorneys have filed a motion to get that part of the judge's ruling reversed in an attempt to fully oust Essayli. In September, another US district judge disqualified Nevada's lead federal prosecutor Sigal Chattah, finding that she, too, was not lawfully serving as acting US attorney. ",

    "body": "A restaurant in a popular area near the famed Las Vegas Strip was damaged after an explosive device exploded on Thursday, police said. Authorities said an improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated at Piero's Italian Cuisine, which is across the street from the city's convention centre. The restaurant was empty at the time of the blast early on Thursday morning.A cleaning crew discovered the damage when they arrived about eight hours later and notified authorities, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. Police say they are looking for two male suspects, one of whom arrived at the restaurant on a scooter. They have not yet been publicly identified or located.The suspects were dressed in black and walked up to the front door of the restaurant and placed the device, Sheriff Kevin McMahill said during a news conference on Thursday.The IED ignited, and after a couple minutes of burning, it detonated, causing some damage to the unoccupied building.The sheriff emphasised that there is no known or ongoing threat to public safety, and the community remains safe.The restaurant sits about a block from Las Vegas Boulevard, which is home to the city's famed strip of casinos and hotels. The incident is being investigated by the department's hazards team, along with the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and a counterterrorism unit at the police department.",

    "body": "Israel has identified the hostage body returned by Hamas on Thursday as that of Meny Godard, who was 73 when he was killed in the 7 October attacks. Red Cross vehicles collected his body hours after Hamas issued a joint statement with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad saying it had been located in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza.The Israeli prime minister's office said forensic testing confirmed the body belonged to Godard, who was killed along with his wife, Ayelet, during Hamas's raid on kibbutz Be'eri on 7 October 2023.Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 25 out of 28 deceased hostages, under the first phase of the ceasefire deal - part of a US plan to end the Gaza war.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.For each dead Israeli hostage returned, Israel has agreed to hand over the remains of 15 Palestinians. But with no DNA testing available in Gaza, it is hard to identify them.Hamas seized 251 hostages when it launched the deadly attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which it killed 1,200 people. More than 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, whose figures the UN considers reliable.Of the three bodies still in Gaza, two are Israeli and one is Thai.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the hostages' bodies, but Hamas has said it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.",

    "body": "56 minutes agoDavid GrittenReutersAlaa Abdel Fattah celebrated with his mother, Leila Souief (left), and his sister, Sanaa Seif (right), following his release from prison in SeptemberBritish-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah was stopped from flying to the UK by Egyptian passport control earlier this week, his family says.Mr Abdel Fattah, 43, was Egypt's best known political prisoner until seven weeks ago, when he was released from jail after being granted a pardon by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi.He attempted to fly to London on Tuesday with his sister Sanaa, but was told by officials at Cairo International Airport that he was not allowed to travel. \"They blocked him from boarding the flight and I had to go alone,\" Sanaa told the BBC's Today programme on Friday. There was no immediate comment from the Egyptian government.\"They didn't explain much. Our lawyers in Egypt are trying to understand the legal grounds,\" Sanaa said. She added that her brother had his British passport as well as a recently renewed Egyptian passport.\"I assumed after the renewal of the Egyptian passport that he would be allowed.\"Alaa Abdel Fattah's 13-year-old son, Khaled, lives with his mother in Brighton, where he attends a special needs school because he is on the autism spectrum.Khaled spent a month visiting his father in Cairo following his release from prison, but he has now returned to the UK.\"We're really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly,\" Ms Seif said.She added: \"Khaled needs his father. My nephew… is very, very comfortable in his school and his set-up in Brighton. We can't change. We can't keep creating instability.\"Ms Seif said the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office had been communicating with her family over the issue, but she called on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's office to also give it their attention.The FCDO said in a statement: \"President Sisi's decision to pardon and release Alaa Abdel Fattah was extremely welcome news and a significant step forward.\"\"We continue to press for his urgent return to the UK at the highest levels with the Egyptian government so he can be reunited with his family. The case remains a priority issue for the UK government.\"On Thursday night, Alaa Abdel Fattah and his mother were given the 2025 Magnitsky Award for \"Courage Under Fire\". Sanaa had to collect the award on their behalf.Mr Abdel Fattah rose to prominence during the 2011 uprising in Egypt that forced long-time President Hosni Mubarak to resign.He spent most of his time in prison after 2014, the year after Sisi led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi, following anti-government protests.While in power, Sisi has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of thousands of people.In 2015, a court sentenced Mr Abdel Fattah to five years in prison for participating in an unauthorised protest.In September 2019, only six months after he had been released on probation, he was arrested again and held in pre-trial detention for more than two years.He was convicted in December 2021 of \"spreading false news\" for sharing a post about a prisoner dying of torture and handed another five-year sentence following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.His 68-year-old mother, Leila, launched a 287-day hunger strike last September 2024 to protest against his imprisonment. She lost more than 40% of her original body weight and was twice admitted to hospital in London.",

    "body": "14 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondentGermany's coalition government has agreed a new military service plan to boost troop numbers following months of wrangling between political forces.The new military service plan will mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out a questionnaire on their suitability to serve and, from 2027, to undergo medical screening.The decision comes as Berlin aims to create Europe's strongest conventional army.The boss of Germany's biggest defence firm, Rheinmetall, has told the BBC he believes that target could be met in five years.Lawmakers are expected to vote on the plan by the end of 2025. Armin Papperger said Chancellor Friedrich Merz's aim to boost the Bundeswehr was \"realistic\" and he told the BBC that \"clear decisions\" were coming from government.Earlier this year German defence chief Gen Carsten Breuer warned that the Western Nato alliance had to prepare for a possible Russian attack within four years.Mr Papperger said he had \"no glass ball\" about the future but agreed Germany had to be \"ready in '29\".When they formed a coalition earlier this year, Merz's conservative CDU/CSU and the centre-left Social Democrat SPD agreed to re-introduce military service which would be voluntary \"to start with\".The Bundeswehr currently has around 182,000 troops. The new military service model aims to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year, rising to between 255,000 and 260,000 over the next 10 years, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists.From next year, all 18-year-old men and women will be sent a questionnaire to assess their interest and willingness to join the armed forces. It will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.From July 2027 all men aged 18 will also have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for duty.If the government's targets are not met, a form of compulsory enlistment could be considered by parliament. If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Some within Germany's political left remain deeply opposed to mandatory service.Many young Germans are wary and a significant majority oppose it. A recent Forsa survey for Stern magazine suggested while just over half of respondents favoured compulsory service, opposition rose to 63% among 18- to 29-year-olds.\"I don't want to go to war because I don't want to die or I don't want to be shot at,\" said Jimi, a 17-year-old student from Berlin, who attended an anti-conscription protest outside the Bundestag earlier this week. \"I also don't want to shoot people.\"An attack against Germany was an \"unlikely and abstract scenario\" that the government was using to legitimise \"stealing millions of young people's right to decide what they should be doing\", he said.Meanwhile, 21-year-old Jason signed up as new Bundeswehr recruit earlier this year because of the current \"security situation\".\"I wanted to contribute to defend peace, to defend democracy if the worst happens,\" he said. By joining up he felt he was \"giving back to society\" but also believed in the deterrent potential of the army, \"so potential enemies don't even think about attacking you\".Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has sought to reassure Germans, saying that despite the new military service plan there was \"no cause for concern... no reason for fear\".\"The more capable of deterrence and defence our armed forces are, through armament through training and through personnel, the less likely it is that we will become a party to a conflict at all,\" Pistorius said.Defence spending in Germany tumbled after the end of the Cold War, while conscription was suspended in 2011.Given its past, Germany has long been shy of showing military might, but earlier this year Friedrich Merz announced that the rule for German defence \"now has to be whatever it takes\", following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Nato countries across Europe have come under pressure from President Donald Trump's White House to hike spending.European moves to re-arm have meant significant revenue for Rheinmetall. Its CEO, Armin Papperger, whose firm also supplies Ukraine, said: \"We make a lot of money because there is a huge demand.\"\"We have to grow strong on vehicles, on ammunition, we have to have our own satellite competencies. We do much more on the electronics and artificial intelligence... than ever before,\" he said.A US report last year suggested the Rheinmetall boss had been the target of a Russian assassination plot. There was no confirmation at the time and Mr Papperger would not be drawn on the report, saying: \"I feel good, I feel safe.\"Asked about whether he felt Europe was in a state of a cold or hybrid war, he said: \"Whatever you call it, it's not a peaceful time.\"",

    "body": "The Nigerian government has announced it is cancelling a controversial policy that mandated the use of indigenous languages for teaching in the earliest years of schooling instead of English.Education Minister Tunji Alausa said the programme, introduced just three years ago, had failed to deliver and was being scrapped with immediate effect.Instead, English will be reinstated as the medium of instruction from pre-primary levels through to university.The now-defunct programme was launched by former Education Minister Adamu Adamu, who had argued that children learnt more effectively in their mother tongue.At the time, Adamu argued that pupils grasped concepts more readily when taught in \"their own mother tongue\" - a view supported by numerous UN studies on early childhood education.Nigeria's education system is facing serious problems, such as poor-quality teaching, inadequate materials, low pay for teachers and numerous strikes.Although 85% of children go to primary school, less than half complete their secondary education.Some 10 million children are out of school in Nigeria, more than in any other country, according to the UN.Announcing the reversal of the language policy in the capital, Abuja, Dr Alausa pointed to poor academic results from those areas which had adopted mother-tongue teaching.He cited data from the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), the National Examinations Council (Neco), and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb).\"We have seen a mass failure rate in WAEC, Neco, and Jamb in certain geo-political zones of the country, and those are the ones that adopted this mother tongue in an over-subscribed manner,\" the minister stated.The abrupt cancellation of the policy has drawn a mixed response from education specialists, analysts and parents.Some have hailed the government's decision, agreeing that the implementation was problematic and contributed to falling standards.Others, however, believe the policy was abandoned prematurely. They argue that such a significant shift requires substantial investment in teacher training, the development of textbooks and learning materials, and a longer timeframe before it can be fairly judged and begin to bear fruit.Education expert Dr Aliyu Tilde praised the reversal, saying Nigeria isn't ready for such a move.\"Does Nigeria have trained teachers to teach in the dozens of indigenous languages in the country? The answer is no. Also the major exams like WAEC, Jamb are all in English and not in those mother tongue languages.\"I think what's needed to improve the quality of our schools is bringing in qualified teachers,” he told the BBC.A mother who has two children in early education schools, Hajara Musa, said she supported the reversal as it would help young children to learn English at an early age.\"English is a global language that is used everywhere and I feel it's better these kids start using it from the start of their schooling instead of waiting for when they are older,” she told the BBC.However, social affairs analyst Habu Dauda disagreed.“I think it was scrapped prematurely instead of giving it more time. Three years is too little to judge a big shift such as this - the government ought to have added more investment,\" he said.The debate highlights the ongoing challenge in Nigeria of balancing the promotion of its rich linguistic heritage with the practical demands of a national curriculum and a globalised economy where English proficiency is dominant.",

    "body": "35 minutes agoAmy Walker and Simon Atkinson,SydneyDozens of schools and preschools across Australia and New Zealand have been fully or partially closed after a warning over asbestos risks in children's sand.A recall notice for the coloured products, which were found to contain traces of tremolite asbestos, was issued by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) on Wednesday.The regulator said there was a \"low\" risk that the asbestos could become airborne or fine enough for inhalation, but it \"may still pose a risk\".New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has also urged people to stop using the sand and arrange for safe disposal \"through licensed professionals\".On Friday, at least 15 schools and seven preschools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) - where Canberra is situated - were fully closed, with six others partially closed as a precaution. There are also reports of a school closure in Queensland.In New Zealand, the Ministry of Education said on Friday that five early learning services and two schools would close temporarily while licensed professionals addressed possible asbestos contamination, public broadcast RNZ reported.In an earlier statement on Wednesday, MBIE product safety spokesperson Ian Caplin urged those who had bought the products to \"act immediately\".\"Stop using the sand, contain it, secure it in a safe place and arrange for safe disposal through licensed professionals, a list of these is available on the WorkSafe website,\" he said.The ACCC said tremolite asbestos, a naturally occurring asbestos, had been detected in some samples after laboratory testing. But it added that respiratory asbestos had not been detected in any of the samples and the release of respiratory asbestos fibres from the sand was \"unlikely\" unless it was \"processed by mechanical means\" such as crushing or pulverising.Asbestos becomes dangerous when fibres are breathed in. They can damage the lungs and cause diseases including cancer.Importing or exporting asbestos or goods containing asbestos is prohibited under both Australian and New Zealand law.The sand products, which are imported from China and sold throughout Australia between 2020 and 2025, are sold by several stationery supply chains, including one of the country's most popular retailers, Officeworks.The products set out in the recall notice are labelled as Kadink Sand (1.3kg), Educational Colours - Rainbow Sand (1.3kg) and Creatistics - Coloured Sand (1kg).New Zealand's MBIE said it had been notified that a voluntary recall for two products sold in the country - EC Rainbow Sand (1.3kg) and Creatistics - Coloured Sand (1kg products) - was underway.It added that it was taking \"precautionary action\" while it established the extent of the risk posed by the \"potentially contaminated product\".The company Educational Colours has also issued a recall notice while testing of the product in New Zealand is ongoing, the MBIE said. Officeworks has also advised that the affected products have been sold in Australia, the ACCC said.Yvette Berry, the ACT's education minister, said on social media that the products were \"used at some of our public schools for sensory play, and arts and crafts\".\"I understand that this news might be upsetting for families,\" she added. \"Closing schools will allow testing and remediation to occur as soon as possible\".A spokesperson for the state of Victoria confirmed no state schools will close there over the warning, saying they'd been advised \"the health risk from the use of these products is low\".\"As such, there is no indication of a need to close schools or early childhood services at this time,\" they added.The spokesperson said officials were working \"swiftly\" to identify schools and early childhood services that may be using the recalled products, and will then support them to follow the remediation advice from relevant authorities.In New South Wales, where there have also been no school closures, a safety alert was sent to all public schools to \"immediately and safely remove these sand products if they have them\".\"The health, safety, and wellbeing of students, staff, and the school community is the department's highest priority,\" they added.",

    "body": "A man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed actress Ariana Grande at a Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore has been charged with being a public nuisance. A now viral video shows the Australian man, Johnson Wen, pushing past photographers and charging at Grande while the cast made its way down a yellow carpet surrounded by fans. Co-star Cynthia Erivo could be seen wrestling the stunned actress away from Mr Wen. The 26-year-old had posted on Instagram late on Thursday that he was \"free after being arrested\". However, on Friday afternoon, he was charged with being a public nuisance by a Singapore court.  The incident caused massive outrage in the city state.Local media reports say Mr Wen, who was unrepresented, intends to plead guilty. This is not the first time Mr Wen, who describes himself as a \"Troll Most Hated\", has invaded a concert or event. His Instagram feed includes clips of him disrupting other celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year. He did the same at a concert by The Chainsmokers last December.If found guilty, he may be fined up to S$2000 ($1540; £1170). Fans had earlier called for him to be arrested and deported. \"There needs to be action [taken] against him as this is clearly a criminal offence,\" wrote an Instagram user, in a comment a video Mr Wen posted of his act.  \"Oh wow so you do this a lot... how aren't you in jail?\" one Instagram user wrote. Several accused Mr Wen of \"re-traumatising\" Grande, who has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at the end of her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.\"Ariana has been through so many scary things... and at her Manchester concert and you thought it would be fun to jump the barricade?\" said another comment on Instagram. Some fans also criticised security officers at the Thursday event for not being vigilant enough; while others called for social media platforms to ban Mr Wen's videos.In clips circulating online, Grande appeared shocked when she was grabbed by the intruder. Her co-stars Michelle Yeoh and Erivo can be seen comforting her while Mr Wen was escorted away by security.Grande has not commented on the incident, and the rest of the event proceeded as planned.The BBC has reached out to Singapore's police and immigration authority for comment.Hundreds of fans had gathered in a sea of green and pink at the Wicked: For Good Asia-Pacific premiere in a Singapore mall, including some who had stood in line for as long as eight hours before it began.The movie, to be released on 21 November, is the second of a two-part adaptation of the popular Broadway and West End musical Wicked, which centres on the unlikely friendship between two very different witches.The musical itself is a spin-off of the 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.Grande, who plays the good witch Glinda, was decked out in a champagne pink sequin dress at the premiere while Erivo, who plays the wicked witch, wore a black tube grown embroidered with roses.They were joined by co-star Jeff Goldblum who plays the wizard.The first movie, Wicked, was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations, winning two for best costume and production design.",

    "body": "1 hour agoToby Luckhurst,In Kyiv and Ottilie MitchellWatch: Kyiv air defences downing Russian drones and missiles during attackAt least four people were killed when a Russian drone penetrated an apartment block in eastern Kyiv, during a wave of strikes throughout the Ukrainian capital.Condemning the attacks as vile and calculated, President Volodymyr Zelensky said about 430 drones and 18 missiles had been launched and dozens of high-rise buildings damaged.As emergency workers sifted through the wreckage of the block of flats in the Lisovyi area, one Kyiv resident called Vita described how the drone had pierced the building, exploding on the other side.Several other regions were also targeted. A drone attack on a market at Chornomorsk in the south of the country killed two people.The Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk was hit in an overnight Ukrainian attack. Fire broke out at the major Sheskharis oil refinery, and a ship and apartment blocks were hit, officials said.Krasnodar governor Veniamin Kondratyev said three crew members and another man were hurt in the attack which damaged the main oil depot and a container terminal.President Zelensky said Ukraine had fired long-range \"Long Neptune\" cruise missiles during its attacks on Russia overnight, without specifying what they targeted.Mayor Andrei Kravchenko has declared a state of emergency and Reuters reports that oil exports have been halted.ReutersKyiv fire service said the drone destroyed several floors of the entire block of flatsIn Kyiv, residential buildings came under attack \"in practically every district\", the head of the city's military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram.He issued a warning to take shelter a minute after midnight local time on Thursday night, writing \"it's loud in Kyiv\".The fire service in the Lisovyi neighbourhood on Kyiv's left bank said later the drone had hit the seventh floor of an apartment block. When it exploded all the floors - from the eighth down to the fourth - collapsed, a spokesman told the BBC.Vita said she saw all four bodies being pulled out of the apartment a few doors down from hers: \"I saw it with my own eyes.\"Two cranes hoisted emergency workers outside the block, as crews combed through the destroyed building, throwing broken sections of wall and shattered glass to the ground.Falling debris and fires damaged multiple high-rise apartment buildings, a hospital, school and administrative buildings, according to emergency services. Oleh Kiper/TelegramA drone killed at least two people at a market in Chornomorsk in southern UkraineMore than 40 people were rescued, they added, including 14 from a fire in a residential building. Another person was rescued after being pulled from beneath rubble, they said.Kyiv's energy infrastructure was badly hit, leaving some buildings in the capital without heat, officials said. \"The attack was massive, with drones, with ballistic [missiles], with lots of air defence working,\" Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko told the BBC. \"Very often there was the feeling that your bed was just shaking  together with the windows.\"Medical teams were deployed to all fires, officials said, while Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nine people were being treated in hospital with one man in an \"extremely serious condition\".ReutersWitnesses described how a Russian drone pierced the entire block of flats in Kyiv before explodingUkraine's air force warned drones and guided bombs had been targeting several other regions, including Sumy.The overnight strikes follow the deaths of six people in another Russian offensive less than a week ago that also damaged residential buildings and energy infrastructure. Russia says its attacks on energy targets, now a familiar part of the war, are aimed at the Ukrainian military, although Kyiv has long rejected that claim.President Zelensky has called for \"no exceptions\" to Western sanctions on Russian energy - although shortly after the US granted Hungary one such exemption. US President Donald Trump had initially announced the sanctions on Russian oil after saying ceasefire talks with Russian President Vladimir were not progressing. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoMadeline HalpertKristy GammonMs Gammon and her husband used to enjoy travelling to the US to go to Baltimore Orioles gamesKristy Gammon used to travel to the US from Canada at least once every other year, taking ski trips at Lake Placid in New York and travelling to Baltimore, Maryland, for her husband's favourite Orioles baseball games.But those trips are now over, she said. This year, the Nova Scotia resident has avoided even passing through the US on her way to Ontario, a shortcut for an otherwise 18-hour drive.Since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the 62-year-old said she and most of her Canadian friends have decided to stop visiting the US as a way of protesting policies they oppose and trade actions Trump has taken against Canada.\"There are so many things that we just feel aghast about in terms of how [the administration] is acting internationally, behaving toward their own citizens, how they're treating their allies and neighbours, i.e. Canada,\" Ms Gammon said.Ms Gammon and her friends are part of a trend that shows no signs of slowing. October marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. Air travel from Canada to the US dropped nearly 24%, while car travel fell more than 30% when compared to the same period last year, according to data released this week by Canada's statistics office.Overall, the US has seen a 3.2% drop in international spending in the country, driven primarily by fewer visitors from Canada, according to the US Travel Association, a nonprofit group representing the American travel industry.As relations between the two countries remain icy, mostly in response to new tariffs Trump has imposed, Canadians are apparently committed to giving their southern neighbours the cold shoulder.In the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending over $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association.They began to curb their US travel after Trump imposed a series of tariffs on goods from the country earlier this year, saying he wanted to reduce the trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods the US buys from Canada and those it sells to them. Trump also said Canada should do more to reduce the flow of illegal drug fentanyl into the US.Canada is currently facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under an existing North American free trade agreement - as well as individual levies targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing.Trade talks between the two countries were derailed last month when Trump was angered by an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that featured Ronald Reagan and was sponsored by the province of Ontario.Meanwhile, he has angered Canadians with his many public comments about making their country the \"51st state\".Some popular tourist destinations in US have tried to buck the trend, attempting to entice Canadian travellers back to the US. In Kalispell, Montana, home to Glacier National Park, officials have been offering a \"Canadian Welcome Pass\" that includes deals and discounts at local businesses for those crossing the border.\"For the last several months, our countries have been going through some things. But there's one thing we know and it's this – we miss you,\" the website for the welcome pass says.Major events scheduled to take place in the US in the coming years could help drive visitors from other places and replace the missing Canadian tourists, including the FIFA 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, according to the US Travel Association.'Come hug it out!' - How a Canadian tourism ad went viralStill, with Canadians choosing to travel closer to home, the country's own tourism industry has gotten a boost. Canada's tourism sector made a record-breaking C$59bn from May to August of 2025, up 6% from the same period last year, mostly because of people choosing to travel domestically, according to Destination Canada, a national tourism organisation.Some of those choosing to stay home are Canadian snowbirds, retirees who travel south to states like Florida to find warmth in the winter months. A survey from the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada found these baby boomers were staying home more than other age groups, with only 10% planning US trips for this year, down 66% compared to last year.Ms Gammon said some of her friends have even chosen to sell their winter homes in Florida because of the frosty relations and frustrations with the Trump administration.\"They've completely changed their snowbird plans,\" the semi-retired family physician said. \"You can feel there's a shift.\"Ms Gammon said she did not know if others would stick to boycotting the US for the remaining three years of the Trump administration. But, even though she misses her US trips, that is her plan for now.\"Who knows what could change between now and three years,\" Ms Gammon said. \"But it would have to be pretty significant changes for us personally to change our minds.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoImogen FoulkesIn BernAPTrump was pictured on Monday apparently with the Swiss gifts on his desk in the Oval OfficeSwiss ministers have had \"very positive\" talks in Washington, US officials say, in a bid to cut US President Donald Trump's steep 39% tariffs on Swiss exports to the US – the highest in Europe.One senior US official said the Swiss were \"very aware\" of their trade deficit and were prepared to address it - hopefully leading to a \"meaningful reduction\" in tariffs.Swiss economics minister Guy Parmelin, meanwhile, said the two sides had \"clarified almost everything\" in the talks. Switzerland been trying to bring down the tariff rate - which has hit the country hard - for months.Swiss industry chiefs came to the Oval Office on 4 November bearing gifts,  including a Rolex gold watch and a specially engraved gold bar from Swiss-based gold refining company MKS.Initial attempts by Swiss President Karin Keller Sutter to change Trump's mind fell on deaf ears. However, a private business initiative last week may have made all the difference. Trump's response to the Swiss president's bid was that she \"was a nice woman, but she did not want to listen\".But after last week's private business initiative Trump said a deal was being worked on to bring the tariffs \"a little bit lower… I haven't set any number\".For Swiss industry, that deal could not come soon enough. Tech exports to the US are down 14.2% on the third quarter of last year, according to latest statistics - a dramatic fall since the tariff hike was imposed in August.Some figures in Swiss business, particularly those trading in luxury goods, gold, or commodities, already had contacts in Trump's circle.In September, Trump appeared at the US Open tennis final in the Rolex VIP box hosted by the Swiss watch company's chief executive Jean Frédéric Dufour. MANDEL NGAN/AFPJean Frédéric Dufour and Trump stood together in the Rolex VIP box in New York in SeptemberThe president, apparently guessing what was going on, even asked if Dufour would have been there if Trump had not slapped such steep tariffs on Switzerland.Last week Dufour met Trump again, this time in the Oval Office, along with fellow business leaders including Johann Rupert from luxury goods maker Richemont and Marwan Shakarchi from MKS.It is quite normal nowadays for any leader heading to the Oval Office to come bearing a gift.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brought an invitation from King Charles for a lavish state visit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz offered a framed copy of Trump's German grandfather's birth certificate.Requests for confirmation of the gifts to the two Swiss companies involved brought a \"no comment\" from Rolex and MKS.But days after the meeting, Trump was pictured in the Oval Office with what looked very much like a Rolex \"Datejust\" desk clock, produced by the company as a collector's item, and worth tens of thousands of dollars.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFPThe Rolex desk clock was pictured on Trump's desk on MondayA White House official confirmed the two items had been given to Trump.The US president receives thousands of gifts every year and they then become US property, deposited with the National Archives and filed annually by the state department. They are eventually transferred to a presidential library. Some gifts can be kept but presidents have to pay federal taxes if they do not come from a close relative.In 1969, President Richard Nixon gently refused the gift of a Swiss Omega watch to commemorate the Moon landings.Whatever happens to the Swiss gifts, Trump's stance towards the Swiss appears to be softening, telling reporters he is working on something \"to help Switzerland\".Swiss economy minister Guy Parmelin and chief trade negotiator Helene Budliger Artieda, who travelled to Washington on Wednesday, are more hopeful than they have been in months, amid suggestions that 39% tariff may be reduced to 15% - the same as Switzerland's neighbours in the EU.In return, promises from the Swiss pharmaceutical giants to build more production plants in the US are already on the table. It is also reported that Swiss International Airlines, whose fleet is primarily Airbus, may pivot towards Boeing.But will it be enough? Swiss industry is waiting with bated breath. A number of Swiss companies have warned they will have to furlough staff if nothing changes.The Swiss do have one more highly influential figure they can call on.Fifa president and Swiss citizen Gianni Infantino, long a friend of Trump's, was reportedly urged by some Swiss parliamentarians to try to change the president's mind.As part of preparations for next year's World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico, Infantino visited the Oval Office in August bearing the trophy.As the cameras rolled, he handed it to Trump saying he was \"a winner\". The president responded asking \"can I keep it? That's a beautiful piece of gold\".Infantino has also announced a brand new Fifa world peace prize, to be announced in Washington DC on 5 December.All bets are off as to who that might be.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterReuters / AFP via Getty ImagesThe BBC has apologised to US President Donald Trump for a Panorama episode that spliced parts of his 6 January 2021 speech together, but rejected his demands for compensation.The corporation said the edit had given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not show the 2024 programme again.Lawyers for Trump have threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Breakfast she was confident the corporation was \"gripping this with the seriousness that it demands\", adding her role was to ensure \"the highest standards are upheld\".But she also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the BBC's editorial standards and guidelines were \"in some cases not robust enough and in other cases not consistently applied\", adding that there would need to be people \"at a very senior level with a journalistic background\".Political appointments to the corporation's board would be examined in the BBC's charter review, she said in response to a question asking if member Sir Robbie Gibb, a former political adviser to Theresa May, had overstepped his remit and weighed into politics.While this was a matter for the board and its chairman, she said, those appointments \"damaged confidence and trust in the BBC's impartiality\".Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey had urged the prime minister on Thursday to \"get on the phone to Trump\" to put a stop to his lawsuit threat and \"defend the impartiality and independence of the BBC\".The fallout from the scandal led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness on Sunday.BBC News has approached the White House for comment.The apology comes hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.The BBC had been given a deadline of 22:00 GMT (17:00 EST) on Friday to respond. \"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to President Trump's legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday, a BBC spokesperson said. \"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"Why is Donald Trump threatening to sue the BBC?Trump vs the BBC: What hurdles might the president's legal argument face?In Trump's speech he said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Speaking to Fox News, Trump said his speech had been \"butchered\" and the way it was presented had \"defrauded\" viewers.The BBC received the letter from Trump's lawyers on Sunday. It demands a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary, an apology, and that the BBC \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused\".Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutesIn its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC sets out five main arguments for why it does not think it has a case to answer.First it says the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it says the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it says the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it says the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.A BBC insider said that internally, there is a strong belief in the case the corporation has put forward, and in its defence.Fresh claim of misleading editEarlier on Thursday, the BBC was accused of another misleading edit of Trump's 6 January 2021 speech, two years before the Panorama sequence aired.On a Newsnight programme from 2022, the edit is a little different from Panorama.Trump is shown as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.\"This was followed by a voiceover from presenter Kirsty Wark saying \"and fight they did\" over footage from the Capitol riots.Responding to the clip on the same programme, former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who quit a diplomatic post and became a critic of Trump after describing the 6 January riots as an \"attempted coup\", said the video had \"spliced together\" Trump's speech.\"That line about 'we fight and fight like hell' is actually later in the speech and yet your video makes it look like those two things came together,\" he said.In response to Thursday's story in the Telegraph, a BBC spokesperson said the BBC holds itself to the \"highest editorial standards\" and the matter was being looked into.A spokesman for Trump's legal team told the Telegraph it was \"now clear that BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump\".Concerns over the Trump Panorama documentary emerged when a leaked internal memo, written by a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial standards committee, was published by the Telegraph newspaper. Among other things, the document also criticised the BBC's reporting of trans issues, and BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.",

Mr McDonald encountered the shark while windsurfing, saying later that he believed \"this is the moment that is the end of my life\". The shark gnawed on his board and then dived deeper into the ocean, leaving him mostly unharmed. While the shark ruined his board, it has not stopped Mr McDonald already buying a new one so he can return to the waves soon.",

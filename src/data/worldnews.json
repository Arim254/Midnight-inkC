    "body": "Clashes between anti-government protesters and riot police in the Peruvian capital, Lima, have left a 32-year-old man dead and more than 100 people injured, including many police officers.The protests come less than a week after José Jerí was sworn in as the interim president following the impeachment of his predecessor in office, Dina Boluarte.Wednesday's demonstrations were organised by mainly young Peruvians who demand that the country's political class do more to combat high levels of crime and corruption. President Jerí said the protest had been infiltrated by criminals set on causing chaos and launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the protester's death.He wrote on X that he \"regretted the death\" of Eduardo Ruiz Sáenz, but did not give further details as to what caused it. Ruth Luque, a left-wing member of Congress, meanwhile said that \"preliminary information\" indicated the hip hop artist had been killed by a bullet wound to the chest. Luque posted a photo of herself on social media in which she can be seen speaking to a member of staff at the hospital to which many of those injured in the clashes were taken.Local media quoted witnesses who said they saw the musician being shot by a man they accused of being a plainclothes police officer.President Jerí said an investigation would be launched \"to determine objectively what happened and who is responsible\".Jerí of the conservative Somos Perú party was sworn into office on Friday last week after the then-President, Dina Boluarte, was impeached on grounds of \"permanent moral incapacity\".Jerí is the seventh president to lead Peru in the space of eight years.As head of parliament, he was next in line to fill the post left vacant following Boluarte's ouster, to serve out the remainder of her term until the presidential election scheduled for April of next year.But within days of him taking office, anger at what protesters call the \"political class\" has spread with thousands taking to the streets to demand \"a clean slate\".The protesters also demanded that the government do more to combat corruption and crime, specifically a wave of extortions which has seen bus and taxi drivers threatened by gangs.Young activists organised protests in several major cities and demanded that Jerí step aside in favour of an independent lawmaker. In a message uploaded to TikTok, one of them calling himself \"Lando\" accused Jerí's party of having propped up Boluarte, whose popularity rates were in the single figures before her removal. Somos Perú, which in the past had backed Boluarte, switched sides last week and joined the chorus of those demanding she be impeached. Analysts say that the armed attack by gunmen on a band on 8 October and the outcry it triggered meant that lawmakers who had previously supported Boluarte felt her position had become untenable. The ex-president remains in Peru and said earlier this week that she would stay in the country pending several investigations into alleged abuses of power, which she denies. ",

    "body": "The most prominent Palestinian prisoner, Marwan Barghouti, was beaten unconscious by Israeli prison guards on 14 September, his family has said.The 66-year-old - serving life for planning deadly attacks against Israelis - was allegedly assaulted by eight guards during a transfer between Ganot and Megiddo prisons.The Israel Prison Service told the BBC: \"These are false claims (fake). The Israel Prison Service operates in accordance with the law, while ensuring the safety and health of all inmates\".Barghouti's son, Arab, told the BBC the family had received testimony from five separate detainees who were released this week who heard Barghouti's account of the attack. He said the family was \"horrified\".Barghouti was allegedly handcuffed by the guards, put on the floor, kicked and beaten.\"They focused on the head area, they focused on the chest area and also on the legs,\" he said. \"He stayed unconscious for hours, he was bleeding, and he could hardly walk.\"Arab said he believed the attack took place as his father was transferred between the two prisons, which are in southern and northern Israel, because there were no surveillance cameras to capture it.Barghouti is serving five life sentences plus 40 years after being convicted by an Israeli court in 2004 of planning attacks in which five civilians were killed.The detainees who told the family of the attack had been released as part of Monday's hostage and prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas, Arab said. Barghouti's name was at the top of a list of seven high-profile prisoners whose release Hamas had sought in return for the 20 living Israeli hostages the group was holding in Gaza - but Israel refused to include him.He is seen by many as the one man who could unite Palestinians - and the various Palestinian political factions - across both Gaza and the occupied West Bank.Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he is the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders.Barghouti remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction that dominates the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control. He has been held in solitary confinement since October 2023.Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who is in charge of the prison service, denied Barghouti had been assaulted, but said he was \"proud\" Barghouti's prison conditions had worsened.In August, a video emerged showing Ben Gvir taunting Barghouti in his cell.The 13-second-long video clip was the first time he had been publicly seen in years. He appeared aged and gaunt.In the clip, Ben Gvir tells him: \"You will not win. He who messes with the people of Israel, he who will murder our children, he who will murder our women, we will wipe him out\".As Barghouti tries to interject, Ben Gvir adds: \"You need to know this, throughout history.\"The PA condemned the video. Its Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh described it as \"the epitome of psychological, moral and physical terrorism.\"",

    "body": "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be \"fully operational by the end of 2027\", as part of a drive to toughen defences against Russia and be fully prepared for possible conflict by 2030.\"Drones are already redefining warfare. Having drone defences is no longer optional for anyone,\" Kallas said, referring to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and fears that Moscow may attack the EU.The European Commission's \"defence roadmap\" also proposes strengthening the EU's eastern borders and building air and space \"shields\".Several EU nations have faced Russian incursions into their airspace and US President Donald Trump has urged the bloc to do more to defend itself.The European defence plan comes amid growing European fears that Russia will continue its westward aggression after the war in Ukraine is over, as well as continued ambiguity over Trump's long-term commitment to European security.\"Danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends. It is clear we need to toughen our defences against Russia,\" Kallas told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.Although there seems little chance of the war ending soon, Trump says he is now having a \"lengthy\" conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone, ahead of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday. Trump has indicated that if Putin does not not move to end the war, the US could send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles - a potential move already described as \"escalation\" by the Kremlin.Standing alongside Kallas, European Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius stressed that \"our roadmap shows all the major milestones to achieve defence readiness by 2030, so we can deter Russian aggression, prevent war and preserve peace\".Putin has repeatedly denied that Moscow has any aggressive plans towards the EU. In June, he said the \"myth that Russia is planning to attack Europe, Nato countries is an unbelievable lie... nonsense\".The EU's executive Commission said the 27-member union should be ready by 2030 to \"respond to any crisis, including high-intensity conflict\".It also urged the bloc to \"close critical capability gaps\" - including in air and missile defence, and artillery systems - \"through joint development and procurement\".Many EU countries are also members of Nato and its chief, Mark Rutte, said they were working together to protect member states on the eastern flank from aerial threat.The EU stressed its \"flagship\" projects would be developed in \"close co-ordination\" with Nato, and would not duplicate the Western defensive alliance's work.No estimates were given to the overall cost, but Kubilius said \"we're not talking here about hundreds of billions\".The \"defence roadmap\" still needs to be approved by member states at a leaders' summit next week. However, a number of EU states have already backed plans for a multi-layered \"drone wall\" to quickly detect, then track and destroy Russian drones.In recent weeks,  tensions have escalated between the EU and Russia, after Poland and Romania - both Nato members - said Russian drones had breached their airspace.And Estonia - another Nato member - in September requested urgent consultations  with other alliance members after saying that Russian warplanes had violated its airspace and stayed there for 12 minutes.Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, said its planes were on a \"scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states\".A number of European politicians and military experts have said that Russia's aim is to test Nato's capabilities and and try to sow discord within the alliance. Several Nato members reacted to the reported Russian incursions by sending troops, artillery, and air defence systems to secure the alliance's eastern flank.",

    "body": "10 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterBritish Library BoardThe date of Oscar Wilde's death, 30 November 1900, has been used as the new card's expiry dateThe British Library has honoured late Irish writer Oscar Wilde by reissuing a reader's card in his name, 130 years after his original was revoked following his conviction for \"gross indecency\".The celebrated novelist, poet and playwright was excluded from the library's reading room in 1895 over his charge for having had homosexual relationships, which was a criminal offence at the time.The new card, which will be collected by his grandson, author Merlin Holland, on Thursday, is intended to \"acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering\" Wilde faced, the library said.Mr Holland said the new card is a \"lovely gesture of forgiveness and I'm sure his spirit will be touched and delighted\".The British LibraryBritish Library papers from June 1895 noted: \"Mr O. Wilde excluded from the reading room\"The decision to revoke Wilde's pass for the library - then the British Museum reading room - was recorded without comment in the trustees' minutes for 15 June 1895.He had been in prison for three weeks at the time after being handed a two-year prison sentence with hard labour.The author was convicted after he lost a libel trial against Lord Queensberry, who had accused him of being homosexual after discovering that his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, aka Bosie, was Wilde's lover.The library regulations at the time said anyone convicted of a crime should have their card revoked.'Letter from prison meant so much'The British Library holds handwritten drafts of some of Wilde's most famous plays including The Importance of Being Ernest, An Ideal Husband, A Woman of No Importance and Lady Windermere's Fan.Its collection also includes De Profundis, the letter he wrote to Bosie from Reading Gaol.Mr Holland will collect the new card at a ceremony at the venue on what would have been his grandfather's 171st birthday.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Mr Holland said he felt both \"proud\" of his grandfather and slightly burderened by the responsibility of handling his legacy.\"People will so often write in to me and say, 'I cannot tell you how much your grandfather's De Profundis meant to me',\" he explained.\"It has a note of positivity at the end... he's going to come out of prison and do something again.\"And people have written to me saying, 'In a moment of terrible depression about my own life I read De Profundis, and I just wanted you to know that your grandfather's letter from prison meant so much to me'.\"British LibraryTrustees' papers noted Wilde's exclusion from the library at the timeDame Carol Black, chair of the British Library, described Wilde as \"one of the most significant literary figures of the nineteenth century\".She said that by reissuing his library card, \"we hope to not only honour Wilde's memory but also acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering he faced as a result of his conviction\".She added that they were \"delighted\" to welcome his grandson - who is the author of a new book, After Oscar: The Legacy of a Scandal - to receive the library card on his behalf.",

    "body": "6 hours agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisAFP via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu has had a turbulent start to his job, having resigned last week as prime minister before being reappointedFrance's new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has bought himself breathing space after winning two no-confidence motions tabled by the opposition.In the tightest vote, a motion sponsored by the far left fell 18 votes short of the 289 needed to bring him down. It means that after just five days in office, Lecornu has survived a first major ordeal in parliament and can now focus on the task of passing the 2026 budget.Any relief for the prime minister is likely to be short-lived, with the far left and far right still gunning to bring him down. And the Socialists, who threw a lifeline in the no-confidence motions, have made clear they will not be so indulgent next time round.Also, any tactical victory enabling the government to endure for now is more than offset by the huge damage to France's reputation caused by weeks of confusion and capitulation.Appointed by President Emmanuel Macron four weeks ago, then re-appointed in chaotic scenes on Friday after he resigned on Monday, Lecornu only survives thanks to major concessions made to the left.To buy the support of the Socialist Party, which has 65 or so MPs, the prime minister promised to freeze Macron's most important economic reform of his second term – the raising of the retirement age to 64.But he also made another, possibly more important, gift to the opposition, which has big implications for the chances of obtaining a budget in time for the end-of-year deadline.By pledging not to resort to the constitutional device known as the 49:3 – which lets governments force through laws without a vote – Lecornu handed ultimate control over the budget to the parties in parliament.It is a huge shift in power, reflecting the decline of presidential authority since Macron's botched parliamentary dissolution of July 2024.  For many observers  it heralds a return, for good or ill, to the party politicking that was a hallmark of the pre-1958 Fourth Republic.By assuring MPs that they and not the government would have the last word on the future budget, Lecornu managed to convince the Socialists that he was serious about marking a real \"rupture\" from previous Macronite administrations.But he may also have surrendered any prospect of the kind of belt-tightening debt reduction that the money markets and the European Union are demanding.The draft budget tabled by Lecornu on Tuesday aims to reduce the deficit to 4.7% of economic output (GDP) by making savings of €30bn (£26bn), with a squeeze on spending in the health sector and local administration.But the Socialists have joined the rest of the left and the far-right in denouncing the text as a betrayal of the less well-off.   Party leader Olivier Faure said that he would have no compunction about supporting a new vote of censure, if offending parts of the budget are not removed.AFP via Getty ImagesMathilde Panot's radical-left France Unbowed sponsored one of the two failed no-confidence motionsFrance's National Assembly has been split three ways for the last 15 months, with a centre-right bloc of under 200 MPs facing a left-wing alliance of about the same size and a far-right bloc of about 140, plus some independents.  None of the three prime ministers since then has been able to find a reliable majority.Weeks of bickering in Paris have triggered warnings about the public's growing disillusionment with politics - the spectacle appearing to confirm the notion that the prime aim of most politicians is simply to stay in power.President Macron, who is blamed for the crisis by most French voters, has seen his popularity ratings slump to just 14%. He has been in office for eight years, and the far right and far left have called for his resignation before his second term ends in 18 months.According to his one-time adviser, the veteran essayist and confidant of presidents Alain Minc, Macron \"must now go down as the worst president of the Fifth Republic\".Minc said Macron had come to office promising to act as a bulwark against the far right but he had left National Rally at the gates of power.\"If you look around us,\" said Minc, \"the Germans are petrified about what a French collapse will do to the economy. The British are petrified about the strategic implications. The Italians are laughing at us, because we always laughed at them.\"\"In America, President Trump is saying that smooth-talker Macron has got what he deserves. Only in Russia are they smiling.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoSean SeddonEPABenjamin Netanyahu addressed a memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl cemetery in JerusalemIsrael's prime minister has told a memorial for victims of the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that he is \"determined\" to secure the return of the dead hostages still in Gaza, and that the country will continue to fight terrorism with \"full force\".Benjamin Netanyahu made the comments hours after Hamas returned the bodies of two more hostages but said it was not able to access the remaining 19.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all the bodies in line with last week's Gaza ceasefire deal, though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.Also on Thursday, Donald Trump signalled he was willing to see fighting resume if Hamas \"continues to kill people\".Writing on his Truth Social platform, the US president said \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill\", seemingly referencing reports of violence inside Gaza, where Hamas has been accused of violently targeting internal rivals in recent days. Trump has previously ruled out putting American soldiers on the ground in Gaza.Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli government confirmed that two bodies handed over by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross on Wednesday night had been identified as Inbar Hayman and Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash.Their return, which was overseen by masked Hamas gunmen in Gaza City, took the number of dead hostages returned since Monday to nine out of 28. All 20 living hostages were released on Monday, in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas's military wing said on Wednesday that it would continue to search for the remaining bodies, but that it would require major efforts and specialist equipment.Israel has responded to the delay by threatening to restrict the amount of aid flowing into Gaza.On Thursday, Netanyahu addressed an official memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl national cemetery in Jerusalem, two days after the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the 7 October attack.The prime minister said he remained committed to securing the return of all the dead Israeli and foreign hostages, and reiterated his government's willingness to return to military action if Israel was attacked again.He said: \"Our fight against terrorism will continue with full force. We will not allow evil to raise its head. We will exact the full price from anyone who harms us.\"The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,967 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.ReutersIsraeli Bedouin soldier Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash was buried on Thursday, a day after his body was returned by HamasThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel said Netanyahu's government should \"immediately halt the implementation\" of the ceasefire deal until the 19 bodies were returned. After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior advisers to US President Donald Trump said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing. The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible. One senior US adviser pointed to the level of destruction in Gaza as one reason the search might be slowed, and said rewards could be offered to civilians with information about the location of remains. Hamas has complained to mediators that more than 20 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on Friday.Israel's military, which still controls more than half the territory, has said that it opens fire to remove threats to its troops.Meanwhile in Gaza, work is under way to identify the bodies of Palestinians returned by Israel in recent days in exchange for the hostages' bodies. A further 30 were returned on Thursday, taking the total to 120.There had been some reports that the Rafah crossing with Egypt would reopen on Thursday, having been shut since the Gaza side was seized by Israeli forces in May 2024.The ceasefire deal specifies its reopening would be \"subject to the same mechanism implemented\" during a temporary ceasefire earlier this year, when wounded Palestinians were briefly allowed to pass through to receive medical treatment.On Thursday, an official from Israeli military body Cogat said: \"The date for the opening of the Rafah crossing for the movement of people only will be announced at a later stage, once the Israeli side, together with the Egyptian side, completes the necessary preparations.\"The official also stressed that \"aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing\". Instead, they said, it would continue to enter Gaza through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel and other crossings following Israeli security inspections.",

    "body": "2 days agoPaul MellyWest Africa analystAFP via Getty ImagesSpain is kicking against the prevailing political mood among Western nations when it comes to migration and policies regarding the African continent.At a time when the US, the UK, France and Germany are all cutting back their development aid budgets, Madrid remains committed to continued expansion, albeit from a lower starting point.This week, the Spanish capital has been hosting an African Union-backed \"world conference on people of African descent\". AfroMadrid2025 will discuss restorative justice and the creation of a new development fund.It is just the latest sign of how Spain's socialist-led government is seeking to deepen and diversify its engagement with the continent and near neighbour that lies just a few kilometres to the south, across the Straits of Gibraltar.In July Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares launched a new advisory council of prominent intellectual, diplomatic and cultural figures, more than half of them African, to monitor the delivery of the detailed Spain-Africa strategy that his government published at the end of last year.New embassies south of the Sahara, and partnerships in business and education are planned.The contrast between Spain's approach and that of others in the West is not just in spending but in tone and mindset – and nowhere more so than in dealing with migration.Similar to elsewhere in Europe, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is looking for ways to contain the influx of irregular arrivals.Like other centre-left and centre-right leaders, he finds himself facing an electoral challenge from the radical right, largely driven by some voters' concern over migration, with the hardline Vox party well established in parliament and routinely ranking third in opinion polls.In July, extra security forces had to be deployed against racist gangs roaming the streets of Torre Pacheco, in Murcia region – where many Africans work in the booming horticultural sector – after three Moroccans were accused of beating a pensioner.While the opposition conservative People's Party remains favourable to some immigration, but for cultural reasons wants to prioritise Latin Americans rather than Africans, Vox has been more radical.Responding to the Murcia incident Vox called for a crackdown on immigrants taking up less skilled jobs. The message largely targeted Africans working in fruit and vegetable production, now so crucial to the southern Spanish economy.But for the government the migration presents challenges that are as much practical as political.AFP via Getty ImagesThousands try to make the crossing to the Canary Islands on packed wooden boatsMore than 45,000 people made the perilous sea crossing from Africa's west coast to the Spanish archipelago of the Canary Islands last year. Estimates of those who died while making the attempt range between 1,400 and a staggering 10,460.Others make the shorter journey across the Gibraltar Straits or the Mediterranean to land on Andalusian beaches or try to scramble over the border fences of Ceuta and Melilla, the two Spanish enclave towns on the North African coast.The Spanish administration has to accommodate new arrivals, process their claims and manage their absorption into wider society, whether temporary or more long-lasting.However, in language markedly different from the hostile messaging that emanates from many European capitals, the Sanchez government openly acknowledges the hard economic realities on the ground in West Africa that push people to risk their lives in the effort to reach Europe.And it is trying to move beyond simply saying \"no\" to new arrivals. Instead, it is developing creative alternatives, with a promise to foster movements of people that are safe, orderly and regular and \"mutually beneficial\".On his trip to Mauritania last year, Sanchez stressed the contribution that migrants make to the Spanish economy.\"For us, the migratory phenomenon is not only a question of moral principles, solidarity and dignity, but also one of rationality,\" the prime minister said.The Spanish government funds training schemes for unemployed youth in countries such as Senegal, especially for irregular migrants who have been sent back, to help them develop viable new livelihoods back home.And it has expanded a \"circular migration\" programme that gives West Africans short-term visas to come to Spain for limited periods of seasonal work, mainly in agriculture, and then return.These issues were at the heart of the agenda when Sanchez visited Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania in August last year.A circular migration agreement with the former had been in place since 2021, but similar accords with the Mauritanian and Gambian governments have since followed.The underlying case for this singular approach was set out in detail in the foreign ministry's Spain-Africa strategy. This argued that Europe and Africa \"form part of the same geopolitical space\".But the management of migration is only one motive for the Spanish decision to place emphasis on building relations with Africa – and indeed support a much broader related social-cultural agenda.AFP via Getty ImagesSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (R) met Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani (L) in Madrid last yearThe fundamental premise underlying Madrid's outreach is that Spain, as the European country closest to the continent, has an essential self interest in Africa's progress towards inclusive and sustainable development, and peace and security.That basic rationale might seem obvious.Yet of course history had taken Spain down a quite different path.Other than a few Maghreb footholds and a small tropical outpost – today's independent Equatorial Guinea – its colonial expansion in the 16th and 17th Centuries had mainly been directed across the Atlantic.And over recent decades, European affairs and the Middle East had tended to dominate Madrid's foreign policy priorities, while the main beneficiaries of its development support were the countries of its vast former empire in Central and South America.However, the past few years have seen the Sanchez government preside over a fundamental broadening of outlook.Barely had Albares been installed as foreign minister in July 2021 than he launched a restructuring of his department, in part to strengthen its engagement not only with Latin America but also with the Sahel and North Africa.Confirmation of the wider geographical emphasis came with a development co-operation plan for 2024-27, which for the first time, designated West Africa, including the Sahel, as one of three regions prioritised for assistance, alongside Central and South America.Spain's Africa strategy lays heavy emphasis not just on economic sectors such as infrastructure, digitalisation and energy transition but also particularly on education and youth employment.The cultural dimension includes not only promotion of the Spanish language, with an expanded presence of the Cervantes Institute, but also programmes to help the mobility of academic teachers and researchers.Security co-operation, action on climate change, women's empowerment and an expanded diplomatic presence are unsurprising components in today's environment.However, the strategy also lays very public stress it places on supporting democratic ideas, the African Union and, in particular, the West African regional organisation Ecowas.This will be welcome public encouragement for the latter, which is currently under severe pressure after seeing its 50th anniversary year marred by the walk-out of the Sahelian states – Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger – whose ruling military juntas have refused to comply with its protocol on democracy and good governance.Meanwhile, in a message targeted as much at Madrid's domestic audience as its sub-Saharan partners, the foreign ministry said \"supporting the African diaspora and the fight against racism and xenophobia are also key priorities\".Fine words of course are only a first step. But in today's sour international climate such language really does stand out.Paul Melly is a consulting fellow with the Africa Programme at Chatham House in London.You may also be interested in:Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy'Try or die' - one man's determination to get to the Canary Islands'I found out on social media that my son had died'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "China arrested 30 Christians. Some fear it's the start of a bigger crackdown22 hours agoTessa WongAsia Digital Reporter andKelly NgReutersJin Mingri, seen here in a 2018 file photo, is one of 30 Christians arrested in China last weekendLast Friday Grace Jin Drexel received a text from her father in China, the prominent pastor Jin Mingri, telling her to pray for another pastor who had gone missing.The text said that the other pastor had been detained while visiting the southern  city of Shenzhen.\"Shortly after that, I got a call from my mum. She said she couldn't contact my dad,\" Ms Jin Drexel, who lives in the US, told the BBC. Within hours her family realised that Mr Jin had also been caught up in what has been described by activists as China's largest arrest of Christians in decades.Some now fear that last weekend's roundup of 30 Christians linked to the Zion Church network, which Mr Jin founded, marks the start of what could be a wider crackdown on underground churches.They point to new laws passed in China which appear aimed at curbing underground church activity, and increasing pressure exerted by authorities on church members in recent months.Despite being ruled by the atheist Chinese Communist Party, China has a sizeable Christian population. Government figures in recent years have stated there are about 38 million Protestants and nearly six million Catholics.But these figures likely only account for members of churches registered with the officially approved Catholic Patriotic Association and the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which emphasise loyalty to China and the Communist Party.Rights activists and scholars estimate that tens of millions more Chinese attend unregistered churches, also known as house churches, which do not follow state-sanctioned ideologies.Many of these churches have been impacted by the Chinese government's attempts to increase its control of religious groups over the years. Church buildings have been demolished and crosses have been removed from public view, while religious material has become more tightly policed, with some Christian apps banned in China.In 2005 and again in 2018, the government revised and tightened regulations on religious groups, while in 2016, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for the \"sinicisation\" of religion.Underground churches such as Zion were especially affected by the 2018 rules, which required government approval for worshipping in public. Many were forced to stop public activities and turned to holding online services, or simply shut down.The following years also saw the arrests and sentencing of a few prominent pastors.In recent months, there have been signs of Chinese authorities once again tightening the screws. In May, pastor Gao Quanfu of the Light of Zion Church in Xi'an was detained on charges of \"using superstitious activities to undermine the implementation of law\". The following month saw several members of the Linfen Golden Lampstand Church in Shanxi sentenced to years in prison for fraud, which rights groups have criticised as false convictions.Then in September, authorities announced a new online code of conduct for religious personnel, which only allows online sermons to be conducted by licensed groups. This has been widely seen as an attempt to curtail underground churches' online services.In the last few months, Zion church members have also faced increasing questioning by police officers, Ms Jin Drexel said.Many in Zion saw the stepped-up pressure as a prelude to a crackdown, but few anticipated it would be as large as it turned out to be, she said.Last Friday and Saturday, Chinese authorities launched what's been described as a sweeping crackdown across at least 10 cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Besides Mr Jin who was taken from his main base in Beihai city in Guangxi province, they arrested other pastors, leaders and members of the congregation, according to the church.CSWPolice officers arresting pastor Sun Cong of Zion Church (centre) were seen going through his booksThe BBC has obtained a copy of what appears to be an official detention notice for Mr Jin, issued by the public security bureau in Beihai. It states that Mr Jin is currently held in the Beihai Number Two prison and that he is suspected of \"illegal use of information networks\".The BBC has asked local authorities to confirm the detention.Some of the arrested church members have since been released, but the majority are thought to still be in detention, with some housed in the same prison as Mr Jin.Corey Jackson, founder of Christian advocacy group Luke Alliance, said the nationwide scale and co-ordination of the arrests across China were unprecedented.\"We anticipate that this is just the beginning of a larger crackdown,\" he said, adding that other underground churches in China were now preparing themselves for arrests.Another Christian advocacy group, Open Doors, said the arrests were significant. \"Zion Church was very well known and outspoken and it may have reached the level of organisation that authorities are getting nervous about organised social entities they do not control,\" a spokesperson said.He warned that China's \"policy of acting against house churches will continue\" and that authorities may accuse more church members of fraud and economic crimes \"as a strategy of intimidation\".Sean Long, a Zion Church pastor and spokesperson based in the US, said other churches will be targeted as there is \"a new wave of religious persecution emerging quickly across China\".He called the latest arrests a \"systematic roundup\" to \"unroot Zion\", and quoted the Chinese idiom \"killing the chicken to scare the monkeys\".\"Zion is the chicken, we are the most influential... it's to scare other Christians and house churches in China.\"When asked by the BBC for a response, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said: \"We would like to stress that the Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious belief in accordance with law. Meanwhile, all religious groups and religious activities must comply with the laws and regulations of China.\"Earlier this week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it \"firmly opposes the US interfering in China's internal affairs with so-called religious issues\", in response to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's condemnation of the Zion church arrests.Getty ImagesChina officially has 38 million Protestants and six million Catholics, but tens of millions more Chinese are believed to attend underground churchesZion's story began with Jin Mingri, also known as Ezra Jin. Born in 1969 during the Cultural Revolution in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, he was a believer in the Chinese state while growing up.That changed in 1989 when, as a student in the prestigious Beijing University, he began taking part in the pro-democracy movement that was eventually crushed in the Tiananmen Massacre.While he did not happen to be at Tiananmen on 4 June, the events at the square changed his life. \"It was a pivotal moment. For his whole life, he had faith in the state. When that was betrayed, it shattered his entire world view. It was a big come-to-Jesus moment,\" Ms Jin Drexel said.At first Mr Jin pursued his new Christian faith at a Three-Self church. In 2002 he moved to the US with his wife and daughter to study at a seminary in California, where his two sons were born.The family moved back to China in 2007 for Mr Jin to continue his work. But he decided to set up an independent church,  said Ms Jin Drexel, as he could no longer accept the Three-Self doctrine which calls for allegiance to the Chinese state. \"He couldn't be a pastor there as it was not a God-pleasing church... you can't serve two masters.\"Zion began as a small house church in Beijing with just 20 followers. But over the years it expanded and began holding services in a large hall in an office building. As it grew in influence, so did the scrutiny. In 2018, Chinese authorities asked the church to install CCTV cameras in the building, saying it was for \"security\". When it refused, followers began facing what church leaders say was harassment. Later that year, the church was shut down.An exit ban was imposed on Mr Jin, who was placed under close surveillance. His family was able to leave for the US, as did some other church members such as Mr Long.Zion then pivoted to what Mr Long called a \"hybrid model\" where they would hold large online church services coupled with small offline meetings in person. The church grew to about 100 branches across 40 cities in China, and has more than 10,000 followers now.It is why, while the fate of Mr Jin and the other arrested church members remains uncertain and the possibility of a wider crackdown looms, Mr Long is confident that Zion and China's underground churches will survive.\"Persecution cannot destroy the church,\" he said. \"If you look back to history, where there is repression, there's a revival.\"Read more of our China coverage",

    "body": "59 minutes agoWedaeli Chibelushi,Wycliffe MuiaNairobi andGladys KigoNairobiAt least three people have died in Kenya after police fired gunshots and tear gas in a stadium where crowds of mourners had gathered to see the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.Prominent rights group Vocal Africa told the BBC that three bodies of those killed in the chaos had been taken to the city's main mortuary. Local media has reported that a fourth person also died as officers sought to disperse the surging crowds.It is not yet clear whether the police used live ammunition or rubber bullets in the arena, located in the capital, Nairobi. Vocal Africa said those who died had sustained gunshot wounds.Odinga, a giant figure on Kenya's political scene, died in India on Wednesday.His body arrived at the country's main airport on Thursday morning, where the authorities were forced to briefly suspend flights because of the huge crowds gathered there.Mourners had gained access to restricted areas, prompting a \"precautionary closure\" that lasted about two hours.From the airport, thousands of people moved in a procession to escort the vehicle carrying the body to the stadium, about 10km (six miles) from the city centre.Because of the unexpectedly large crowds, the public viewing ceremony for Odinga's body was moved to Nairobi's Moi International Sports Centre in the Kasarani neighbourhood, rather than inside the parliament building where it was initially scheduled to take place.The convoy arrived to a packed stadium, with more people waiting outside.Obituary: A founding father of Kenya's multi-party democracyHow Odinga's court challenges have improved Kenya's electionsMinutes afterwards, a large crowd breached a gate in the arena, prompting the police to fire tear gas. Masses of mourners rushed towards the exits in response.A BBC reporter at the scene also saw men in civilian clothing beating protesters with batons.\"We can confirm that by the end of the day that our officers who were stationed at the Nairobi Funeral Home, also known as City Mortuary, [saw] three bodies brought in with gunshot wounds,\" Hussein Khalid, Vocal Africa's CEO, told the BBC.Other leads were being followed up in case other bodies had been taken to other morgues, he added.After the chaos settled, dignitaries and government officials - including Kenyan President William Ruto - were able to observe the coffin, before the public viewing began for a few hours.Deputy President Kithure Kindiki, who is chairing the funeral planning committee, held a press briefing on Thursday evening - but made no mention of the chaos or deaths.After Friday's state funeral, which would be held with full military honours, the public were invited to view the body \"for as long as is necessary\", he said.Earlier, a stream of supporters had earlier gathered at Lee Funeral Home, where the body was first expected, and around parliament. \"I came here at six in the morning. We have been at the airport to welcome Baba [Odinga's nickname],\" one mourner had told the BBC near the airport.\"We are sad, we have been left as orphans. He is our father.\"Motorcycle rider William Otieno Adoyo said he was a \"Baba die-hard\".\"We want to see Baba, how do we know it's him in the casket? Let them show us and we'll be contented,\" he told the BBC.Mourners have been carrying branches and palm fronds, a symbol of mourning and grief among the Luo ethnic group to which Odinga belonged.On Saturday his body will be transported to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria - his political stronghold.Members of the public will get a chance to view the body before he is buried on Sunday at his farm in Bondo, about 60km west of Kisumu.According to the family, it was Odinga's wish to be laid to rest within the shortest time possible, ideally within 72 hours.The 80-year-old former prime minister collapsed during a morning walk in India on Wednesday morning and he was taken to Devamatha Hospital, about 50km (30 miles) east of the port city of Kochi.A seven-day period of mourning has been declared.He was towering figure in Kenyan politics and for many years was the country's main opposition leader, losing five presidential campaigns, most recently three years ago.Odinga repeatedly said he was cheated of victory, citing the manipulation of votes.Additional reporting by Akisa Wandera, Basillioh Rukanga and Anne Soy in Nairobi",

    "body": "21 hours agoOrla GuerinSenior International Correspondent, in SyriaBBC/Goktay KoraltanHuman remains have been unearthed at this site in Eastern Ghouta, outside DamascusA burly bearded man in a blue tunic moved swiftly through grassy stubble on a windswept road in rural Damascus, collecting bones with his bare hands.He added a jaw to the pile, before gently picking up a skull. Briefly, he kissed it - a moment of tenderness for one of the many victims of Bashar al-Assad. Ten months after Assad was ousted from power last December, in a lightning rebel advance, mass graves are still being uncovered. The Syrian dictator's legacy is embedded in the soil here - skeletal remains where crops should be. There are now more than 60 grave sites and counting.One of the latest came to light in al-Otaiba village, in the district of Eastern Ghouta, where a shepherd stumbled on clothing and human remains after straw was burnt off. The authorities believe as many as 175 bodies were bulldozed into a mass grave in this former opposition stronghold. They are among the legions of the missing. More than 181,000 people were forcibly disappeared or arbitrarily detained during the 14 years of Syria's civil war, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights monitoring group. It says 90% were taken by the Assad regime.BBC/Goktay KoraltanLittle remains of the estimated 175 people buried in the mass grave in al-Otaiba villageThe families of the missing are now demanding answers and justice, from the new Syria – which held its first parliamentary election, of a sort, earlier this month.A \"people's assembly\" was chosen but not directly by the people. One-third of the seats remain to be filled.  The appointees will be hand-picked by Syria's Interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.Depending on your viewpoint in this broken country, and perhaps on your religion or your sect, the election was either a sham or a first step on the road to democracy.As Syria faces forward, President Sharaa - a jihadi fighter turned head of state - says the missing will remain \"a national priority\".BBC/Goktay KoraltanKasim Hamami found a garment which belonged to his missing brotherBereaved relatives like Kasim Hamami are counting on that. They can do little else.We found him digging by the roadside at the mass grave site, pulling secrets from the soil. As we watched, he uncovered a frayed, brownish jumper covered in dirt. It was a last trace of Samer, his brother, who disappeared aged 21.\"Samer was a civilian,\" Kasim said softly, \"and newly-wed, just 15 days into his marriage. He had nothing to do with armed groups. He didn't fight anybody,\" he said.  \"Ghouta was under a blockade. The regime did not allow in any food. He left because of hunger.\" Kasim's three nephews also left with Samer and shared his fate.They were among around 400 people who set out from Eastern Ghouta on 27 February 2014, hoping to reach another rebel stronghold. On the way, they were attacked by the regime and its allies in Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia backed by Iran.We know this because they filmed the slaughter and published the footage. The video - widely circulated online - is hard to watch.BBC/Goktay KoraltanThose buried in al-Otaiba are believed to have been killed by Assad regime forces and their Hezbollah alliesIt shows a column of people walking along a road, straight into an ambush. Landmines are detonated along a 300m (985ft) stretch. The explosions are followed by a hail of bullets.The convoy was mostly men, but included women and children, according to Mohammed Omar Hajjar, the newly appointed public prosecutor for rural Damascus. He believes they were civilians. The regime claimed at the time that the dead were fighters.We met one of the survivors, who gave us a first-hand account of the attack. Bilal, a nurse, was back at the mass grave site, glancing around at the sunlit landscape, reliving his darkest night.BBC/Goktay KoraltanBilal survived the attack on the convoy in 2014\"We left at around midnight,\" he told us. \"I walked behind my colleague, 30m apart. After the mines went off, the wounded were screaming. They killed them in cold blood. I could hear two voices, and I could not help.\"Bilal says he survived by hiding in a bush until the following day and is speaking out now for those who can't. \"I lost my nephew, friends and relatives. Those who set up the ambush should be held to account,\" he said.Will that happen? Many senior figures from the former regime are on the run, and Hezbollah has been devastated by Israeli attacks, and Israel's war on Lebanon in 2024.A Syrian judge has issued an arrest warrant, in absentia, for Bashar al-Assad, in relation to other killings. But the former president has found refuge in Russia – which backed him during the civil war.It's not known if his fate was discussed when President Sharaa held talks with President Putin in Moscow on Wednesday – the former enemies shaking hands in the Kremlin and discussing how to strengthen relations.  If Assad was watching, it won't have been easy viewing.Back home, there is one major change for families he destroyed. They can now share their anguish without risking their lives.BBC/Goktay KoraltanSyrians with missing loved ones are gathering in \"truth tents\" to share their experiencesAbout an hour's drive from the mass grave, we joined a gathering of wives, mothers and daughters of the missing. They met at a \"Truth Tent\" - a community-led forum where Syrians lay bare the horrors of the past. In this case the \"tent\" was a village hall.More than a hundred women crowded in - so many there weren't enough chairs - many wearing black abayas and headscarves.They gathered around us, holding out photos of husbands, fathers or sons - men who may live now only in their memory. More photos were hung in rows on the wall. One woman paused before the display and raised her hand to caress an image.A softly spoken 18-year-old called Bisan recalled how her father was taken away at gunpoint, when she was just four years old. \"They got my dad, handcuffed him and put him in the van,\" she said. \"He asked them why he was being arrested. One of them pointed a gun against his head. We were so scared. We could not do anything back then. I was young and my mum kept crying.\" Her cousin stood alongside as she spoke. Her father was also taken.Around the room, voices rose and fell in a chorus of harrowing accounts of loved ones snatched from work or home and swallowed by the regime's notorious prison system.\"Prisons were filled with the blood, and lives of the innocent,\" shouted one woman from the back of the hall. \"We spent a lot... sometimes even selling our houses, to pay some dog from the regime for information about our brothers, sons or husbands.\"Another woman described being asked to choose between freedom for her son or her husband. \"They took me and my son to the security branch,\" she said. \"They beat us both. They showed me my son on the camera and asked me if I wanted my husband or my son. I said I wanted my son.\"The authorities asked her to sign a paper saying her husband was a terrorist, but she refused. \"I never saw him carrying a weapon,\" she said. \"He went out demonstrating because he was hungry.\"BBC/Goktay KoraltanBisan last saw her father when she was fourAnother veiled woman shouted her demand: execute Bashar al-Assad.\"We will get our rights when he is hanged,\" she said. \"He's to blame for everything.  When we cut the head off the snake, we will heal and make peace with each other.\"Najwa, one of the organisers, took to the stage to urge the families to be patient. Her husband Mohammed al-Hallaq was taken in January 2014. She was given his death certificate later that year but has never found his body.\"The son of a pig, Bashar, broke us for 14 years,\" said Najwa, her voice laden with anger. \"The only thing I ask of you: don't give up, don't stop pushing. It's not going to happen overnight.\"Some wonder if it will happen at all, including a bereaved father called Mohammed, one of the few men at the meeting. His son, Mazen, who worked at the electricity company, was taken by state security in 2013.\"All this talk is not useful, if we don't get action,\" he said tearfully. \"What we need is for the people who took our sons to be on trial.\"There is a now a National Commission for Missing Persons, but it is in its infancy and struggling with a lack of resources - including DNA testing facilities. Syria has only one DNA laboratory.Ten months after the ousting of Assad, the ranks of the missing are still growing. Some families are only now coming forward with accounts of loved ones who are long gone.\"We try to manage expectations,\" says Zeina Shahla, spokesperson for the commission. \"We tell the families we have begun but unfortunately it will take years. In every Syrian village, there might be missing persons.\"At best their loved ones can expect more years of waiting for truth, or justice, or bones to bury.Additional reporting by Wietske Burema, Goktay Koraltan, Lana Antaki and Aref Alkrez.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNikos PapanikolaouGetty ImagesGreece's parliament has approved a contested labour bill that would allow 13-hour workdays, despite fierce opposition and nationwide strikes.The government said it will modernise Greek labour laws, but a spokesperson for the left-wing opposition Syriza party called the bill a \"legislative monstrosity\".Under the new law, annual overtime is also capped at 150 hours, and the standard 40-hour week remains in place.The government insists that the longer workday is optional, only affects the private sector, and can only be applied up to 37 days a year.Thursday's vote was backed by MPs from the ruling centre-right New Democracy party, with centre-left Pasok party - now the main opposition - voting against the bill, while the left-wing Syriza party abstained.Unions have staged two general strikes demanding the bill's withdrawal this month that brought public transport and services to a standstill. Labour Minister Niki Kerameus defended the bill, saying the reforms align Greek legislation with modern labour-market realities, and accused opposition leaders of misleading the public.The laws will give workers the option to take on additional hours with the same employer for 40% higher pay, while ensuring they cannot be dismissed for refusing overtime.This complies with European Union working-time rules, which limit the average week to 48 hours including overtime but allow flexibility over 12 months, the government said.According to officials, the law gives employees the option to work longer for one employer rather than hold multiple part-time jobs, and that participation will remain voluntary.But opposition parties have accused the government of eroding workers' rights and \"pushing the country back to a labour middle age\". They say Greek employees already work longer hours than most Europeans while earning less and still \"struggle to make ends meet.\"The public-sector union ADEDY said flexible working hours in practice mean \"the abolition of the eight-hour day, the destruction of family and social life and the legalisation of over-exploitation,\" the AFP news agency reports.Across the EU in 2024, the longest working weeks in 2024 were recorded in Greece (39.8 hours), followed by Bulgaria (39.0), Poland (38.9) and Romania (38.8). The shortest working week in the bloc is in the Netherlands (32.1), according to Eurostat.As of January 2025, Greece's national minimum wage stood at €968 (£839, $1127) a month, placing it in the lower tier among EU countries. Unemployment, which had peaked at 28% during the financial crisis, was 8.1% in August compared with an EU average of 5.9%, figures from Eurostat show.Greece is recovering since its decade-long debt crisis, which ended in 2018, but wages and living standards remain among the lowest in the EU.",

    "body": "The number of people killed by bears in Japan this year has reached a record high, the country's environment ministry has said.Seven people have died since April - the highest since 2006 when data was first recorded - with fatalities mostly in north-eastern regions and the northern prefecture of Hokkaido.  A 60-year-old man cleaning an outdoor hot spring bath has gone missing what is suspected to be the latest incident.Attacks by bears tend to surge in autumn before bears hibernate, with experts saying low yields of beech nuts because of climate change could be driving hungry animals into residential areas. Depopulation has also been cited as a factor. The environmental ministry figures show the seven fatalities this year surpassed the five recorded in the year to April 2024.About 100 other people have also been injured so far this year, up from 85 injuries and three fatalities, in the previous 12 months.Investigators found human blood and bear fur at the scene of the latest suspected bear attack in the city of Kitakami in Iwate prefecture on Thursday.It comes after it was confirmed that a man found dead last week in Iwate was killed by a bear.Another recent incident took place in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, when a 1.4m (4.5ft) adult bear entered a  supermarket, lightly injuring two men, one in his 70s and another in his 60s.The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come close before.According to local media, the store's manager said about 30 to 40 customers were inside, and the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.The same day a farmer in Iwate region was scratched and bitten by a bear, accompanied by a cub, outside his house.And earlier this month a Spanish tourist was attacked by a bear at a bus stop in the village of Shirakawa-go in central Japan.Two types of bear are found in Japan - Asian black bears, and bigger brown bears which are found on the island of Hokkaido.",

    "body": "1 day agoPaul Brown,Kayleen Devlin,Erwan Rivault andBarbara MetzlerBBC VerifyGetty ImagesAs thousands of Gazans made the journey back to their neighbourhoods following the ceasefire, many of them already knew their homes were in ruins.The prospect of rebuilding homes, businesses and all the institutions and services needed for a return to normal life in Gaza is daunting by any measure: the UN estimates that the damage amounts to $70bn.As Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, says: \"It's worse than starting from scratch - here you aren't starting in the sand, you are starting with rubble.\"The level of destruction on the strip is \"now in the region of 84%. In certain parts of Gaza, like in Gaza City, it's even up to 92%\", says Jaco Cilliers, UN Development Programme special representative for the Palestinians.This damage has created colossal amounts of rubble. Assessments by BBC Verify based on recent satellite data suggest there could be over 60 million tonnes of debris waiting to be cleared in Gaza.Any process of post-conflict reconstruction must begin by clearing the remnants of war.Clearing the rubbleDrone footage shows vast destruction in Gaza CityThe many millions of tonnes of rubble now littering the Gaza Strip are not just piles of concrete and twisted metal. They also contain human remains and unexploded bombs.\"From a safety and humane perspective, the first thing you have to do is make the sites that have been bombed-out safe,\" says former JCB executive Philip Bouverat.There follows a process of sorting, separation and crushing the debris. After materials like plastic and steel are removed, the remaining concrete can be ground up and reused.This will lay the foundations of construction, but building efforts will require the mass import of materials.\"This isn't going to be done by trucks coming across the border. The first thing we need to do is build a deep-water port, because then you can bring thousands of container-loads in\", Mr Bouverat added.When the sites are cleared, then essential services such as water, sewerage and electricity can be restored, he says.Water and sewerageClean water is a major immediate need for Gazans. According to estimates from Unicef, more than 70% of the territory's 600 water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed since 7 October 2023.After the recent announcement of a ceasefire, Israeli soldiers posed in front of a wastewater treatment plant in Gaza City that had been set on fire. The damage came just before Israel's military withdrew from a position near this infrastructure.Wastewater treatment is critical for preventing the build-up of sewage and the spread of disease. Doctors have said Gaza has high rates of diarrhoeal diseases, which can kill children, and a risk of cholera in some areas.In satellite imagery, you can see damage to the bio-towers of the Sheikh Ejleen wastewater treatment plant, which are the main components used for treating sewage.There are six wastewater treatment plants in Gaza. \"All of them are damaged,\" said Maher Najjar, deputy director at Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) which oversees and manages repairs for Gaza's water infrastructure.Since the beginning of the war, repairs have been hugely hampered by the immediate danger from Israeli air and artillery attacks and a shortage of tools, he said. Some facilities have been attacked again after being repaired.The IDF said its actions are \"based on military necessity and with accordance to international law\", as it tries to prevent Hamas \"threatening the citizens of Israel\".Alongside facilities that treat sewage, Gaza has separate plants that provide clean drinking water and which have also experienced major damage.Satellite images from April 2024 show a seawater desalination plant which supplied northern Gaza and Gaza City still intact. But by early May, it had been destroyed.\"We are talking about damaged water wells, damaged networks, reservoirs, carrier lines. It's very hard to know where to start. To begin with we need at least $50m to return around 20% of the services to the population,\" Mr Najjar said.\"The total loss is around $1bn, maybe more.\"HousingSatellite images show the devastation in an area of Sheikh Radwan, a neighbourhood in the north-east of Gaza City.In August before the IDF occupied the city, which it called the \"last stronghold\" of Hamas, many streets appeared largely intact. By last week, whole swathes of the neighbourhood had been flattened as the IDF established a base.Over the course of the war, the UN's satellite centre Unosat estimates a total of 282,904 houses and apartments across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.But these figures are likely to be an underestimate, because they do not yet include the recent military operations in Gaza City, such as the destruction in Sheikh Radwan.The chart below shows how the rate of housing damage increased sharply in the middle of 2024 - coinciding with IDF operations in Rafah, which left much of the city in ruins. Another significant spike is likely to have occurred as a result of the Gaza City occupation.Gaza City's Hamas-run Municipality has said that 90% of its roads have also been damaged.According to Shelly Culbertson, a senior policy researcher at the Washington-based think tank, RAND Corporation, the rebuilding of Gaza's housing \"could take decades.\"\"After the Israeli bombing of Gaza in 2014 and 2021 reconstruction of housing was slow because Israel wouldn't allow in a lot of construction materials because they had dual-use purposes,\" she said.\"If you rebuild now the way they did in 2014 and 2021 it will take 80 years. If there's good planning, it could take less time,\" she said.\"Good planning is designing camps that can turn into neighbourhoods and helping people move back into and rebuild damaged homes.\"PowerGaza's power system was under strain before the current war. Rolling blackouts were frequent, and most Gazans lived on limited hours of electricity each day.Historically, most of Gaza's electricity supply comes from power lines connecting it to Israel and the diesel-fired Gaza Power Plant, with some rooftop and public-facility solar panels added in recent years.Since 11 October 2023, Gaza has experienced a near-total electricity blackout after Israel cut external electricity. One exception was a direct feed to the South Gaza desalination plant, which supplies clean drinking water. Israel reconnected its feed to this plant on 14 November 2024 and then cut it again on 9 March 2025, before reconnecting it once more.The Gaza Power Plant has been inoperable due to a lack of fuel, and solar facilities have suffered widespread damage.With the grid largely down, essential services have depended on limited diesel generators and the remaining solar panels.Getty ImagesSolar panels provide power for these families living in tents near Gaza CityA joint assessment from earlier this year by the World Bank, European Union and UN estimated that more than 80% of power generation and distribution assets have either been destroyed or are non-operational since the start of the war, at an estimated cost in damages of more than $494m.Gaza Electricity Distribution Cooperation (Gedco), the company responsible for managing electricity supply across the Gaza Strip, say 70% of its buildings and facilities have been destroyed since October 2023.At the end of last month, we verified video of the company's headquarters being struck.In a statement following the event, Gedco said the attack had \"directly affected the company's ability to manage its administrative and technical businesses\".AgricultureThe satellite image below of one area east of Jabalia shows how 4 sq km of crops - likely olive and citrus trees - were wiped out over the course of the war.Running through the razed ground is a road or track established by the IDF, probably to provide access to northern areas of nearby Gaza City.Analysis by Prof He Yin of Kent State University found that across the Gaza Strip, 82.4% of annual crops and more than 97% of tree crops were likely to have suffered damage during the war up to 10 August this year.The decline of agriculture, coupled with prolonged restrictions on aid, drove severe food insecurity throughout the conflict, culminating in a famine declaration in Gaza City in September.Unosat attributes this decline to the \"impact of activities such as razing, heavy vehicle activity, bombing, shelling, and other conflict related dynamics\".Mr Bouverat says that in order for agriculture to recover, the land needs to be cleared of unexploded bombs, shells and mines \"pretty urgently\". \"If they can grow their own crops, they can feed themselves, and the sooner we do that the better,\" he says.EducationAbout half of Gaza's population before the war was aged under 18, so rebuilding schools is essential for any return to normal life.School buildings became shelters for displaced Palestinians throughout the conflict, and were frequently targeted by IDF forces with the justification that they housed \"command and control\" centres for Hamas and affiliated groups.The UN relief agency for Palestine, Unrwa, which once operated 288 schools in Gaza, says 91.8% of all of school buildings will require \"full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again\".Higher education institutions have also not been spared.For example, in December 2023, the al-Azhar University to the south of Gaza City was blown up by Israeli troops. The site is now part of the Netzarim Corridor, one of several miilitarised zones established by the IDF over the course of the war.The same fate befell the Israa University less than 2km away. which was demolished by IDF troops after serving as a temporary base for several weeks.Israa university in al-Zahra, Gaza was blown up by Israeli forces",

    "body": "22 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentBBCVirginia Giuffre describes how the photo was taken by Jeffrey Epstein in LondonA posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre accuses the Duke of York of being \"entitled - as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright\", according to extracts published in the Guardian newspaper.The book, Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is due to be published next week, almost six months after Ms Giuffre took her own life.Her book, which calls Epstein a \"master manipulator\", describes three occasions where she alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her, including at Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London. It's further embarrassment for Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, and has always denied any wrongdoing.Getty ImagesVirginia Giuffre holding a picture of herself as a teenagerNobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, is the testimony of Ms Giuffre, who died by suicide in Australia in April, in a book co-written with author Amy Wallace.Ms Giuffre, who met Jeffrey Epstein through Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.The powerful friends were claimed to include Prince Andrew and the extract published in the Guardian gives her account of when they met in London in March 2001, when she was aged 17.She says the day began by being woken by Ghislaine Maxwell: \"It was going to be a special day, she said. Just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince!\"When Andrew arrived later she claims that he was asked to guess her age. \"The Duke of York, who was then 41, guessed correctly: 17. 'My daughters are just a little younger than you,' he told me, explaining his accuracy. As usual, Maxwell was quick with a joke: 'I guess we will have to trade her in soon.',\" says her memoir.Like Epstein, she said she called him \"Andy\".There is also an account of the notorious photograph from that evening.\"My mom would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn't pose for a picture. \"I ran to get a Kodak FunSaver from my room, then returned and handed it to Epstein. I remember the prince putting his arm around my waist as Maxwell grinned beside me. Epstein snapped the photo,\" she writes.They went to dinner and then Tramp nightclub, she recalls, saying Andrew was a \"bumbling dancer, and I remember he sweated profusely\". \"On the way back, Maxwell told me, 'When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey'.\"She says of what happened next: \"He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.\"As has been reported before, she claimed he was \"particularly attentive to my feet, caressing my toes and licking my arches\". And that later Epstein gave her $15,000 for her time with Andrew.Getty ImagesPrince Andrew has continued to face questions about links to EpsteinThe book also reports two other occasions on which she alleges she had sex with Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.All three of the claimed meetings with Andrew have been reported in detail before, including in her previous witness statements and accounts, but this brings them together and provides her own perspective.\"Don't be fooled by those in Epstein's circle who say they didn't know what he was doing. Epstein not only didn't hide what was happening, he took a certain glee in making people watch,\" she writes.The book also reveals that she was taking tranquilisers to cope with her life working for Epstein.\"Sometimes, when I was really struggling, I took as many as eight Xanax a day,\" she writes.She also explained why she didn't leave \"Epstein's lair even after we knew what he wanted from us.\" \"How can you complain about being abused, some have asked, when you could so easily have stayed away? But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable,\" she writes.\"Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care.\"After leaving Epstein, Ms Giuffre had settled in Australia where she lived with her husband and three children. She took her own life at the age of 41.Epstein had killed himself in jail in New York in while awaiting trial. Ghislaine Maxwell was jailed on charges related to sex trafficking.Prince Andrew made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement, after she had brought a civil case against him, and he denies all the accusations made against him.He refutes Ms Giuffre's claims about having sex with him at the three locations: \"I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened,\" Andrew said in his BBC Newsnight interview.\"I can tell you categorically I don't remember meeting her at all.

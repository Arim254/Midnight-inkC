    "body": "Three French teens drown after car crashes upside down in swimming pool2 days agoLaura GozziAFPFirefighters were called several hours after the accident to remove the car from the pool (file pic)Three teenagers were killed when their car skidded off the road in southern France, went through a wall and crashed upside down in a private pool, trapping them inside. The vehicle was a similar size to the pool and the teenagers - aged 14, 15 and 19 - were unable to open the doors and drowned.The freak accident occurred in the town of Alès in the early hours of Wednesday. \"It's truly the height of horror,\" said public prosecutor Abdelkrim Grini. \"It wasn't the impact of the accident that killed them. They found themselves upside down in icy water, unable to get out. They had no chance.\" Unconfirmed reports suggest the youngest of the three victims was at the wheel of the car at the time.The accident, which happened during a night of heavy rain, was the result of an \"unbelievable series of circumstances,\" the prosecutor told AFP news agency.The prosecutor described how the car had smashed through a low-level garden wall, flipped over and landed \"with all four wheels in the air\".It was not for several hours that the alarm was raised and firefighters were called to drain the pool and remove the vehicle. BFMTV reported that the pool was about 1.5m (5ft) deep.A mangled car was pulled on to a firefighters' truck during the morning and video from the scene showed the private swimming pool next to the collapsed wall. Canisters of nitrous oxide were found in the car, according to French reports. The substance is used by recreational users as it can make people feel relaxed, light-headed or dizzy.An investigation has been opened into the cause of death. The three victims' bodies  have been taken to the forensic institute in Nîmes for post mortem examinations, AFP said.",

Officer Martin said the animal had fallen through one of the ceiling tiles before going \"on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything\". Only one blurry CCTV image of the boozy break-in exists, so it's unknown just how much alcohol the thirsty creature consumed before passing out in the bathroom.In a social media post, the store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter for its professionalism and providing its visitor with a \"sober ride home\".Officer Martin said it was \"just another day in the life of an animal control officer\".

    "body": "The Israeli military has carried out a new round of air strikes in southern Lebanon, less than a day after Israel and Lebanon held their first direct talks in decades.Residents of the towns of Mjadel, Baraachit, Jbaa and Mahrouna were told to evacuate areas around locations that the Israeli military alleged were weapons warehouses belonging to the Iranian-backed group. No casualties have been reported.An Israeli military spokesman said the sites constituted a ceasefire violation and warned that it would continue to operate \"to remove any threat\" to Israel. Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon since a ceasefire took effect in November 2024, following 13 months of conflict.There was no immediate comment from Lebanon's leaders in response to Thursday's strikes. Lebanese politicians have previously condemned similar strikes as ceasefire violations.Under the first phase of a deal brokered by the US and France, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to remove its fighters and weapons from south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel - a plan the group and its allies oppose.Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites and stepped up its air strikes in recent weeks. It is an escalation officials say is driven by Hezbollah's attempts to rebuild its military infrastructure and what they see as limited Lebanese government efforts to disarm the group.Thursday's strikes came less than 24 hours after Israel and Lebanon sent civilian envoys to the Lebanese border town of Naqoura for their first direct talks in decades.The talks, hosted at the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission, Unifil, took place during a meeting of the ceasefire monitoring committee, which until now had only included military officers from the US, France, Lebanon, Israel and Unifil.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying the meeting \"took place in a good atmosphere\" and that it \"was agreed that ideas would be formulated to advance possible economic cooperation between Israel and Lebanon\".It also said that Israeli envoys \"clarified that the disarmament of Hezbollah is obligatory, regardless of the advancement of economic co-operation\".Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam was more cautious, saying Lebanon remained \"far\" from diplomatic normalisation with Israel and that the talks were focused on \"defusing tension\".\"We are not yet at peace talks,\" he told reporters, saying Lebanon's priorities were the cessation of hostilities, the release of Lebanese detainees held by Israel, and Israel's full withdrawal from its territory.He added that Beirut was open to the deployment of French and US troops to help verify efforts to disarm Hezbollah.The latest strikes and diplomatic moves coincide with a visit by a UN Security Council delegation to Lebanon to review the stalled implementation of the ceasefire.",

    "body": "A prominent Palestinian militia leader in Gaza who opposed Hamas has been killed.Yasser Abu Shabab headed the so-called Popular Forces group, which has dozens of fighters and operates in Israeli-controlled territory near the southern city of Rafah.The Popular Forces said in a statement that Abu Shabab was shot while \"attempting to resolve a dispute\" between members of the Abu Seneima family. It dismissed as \"misleading\" reports that he was killed by Hamas, which had accused him of collaborating with Israel.An earlier statement from Abu Shabab's Bedouin tribe, the Tarabin, said he had been killed \"at the hands of the resistance\", and accused him of betraying the Palestinian people.Other sources said his death was the result of an internal power struggle.A Hamas statement said the \"fate that befell\" Abu Shabab was \"the inevitable fate of all who betray their people and homeland and are content to be tools in the hands of the occupation [Israel]\", without claiming involvement in his killing.Israel's Army Radio cited a security source as saying that Abu Shabab had died of his wounds after being evacuated to Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. But the hospital denied that he died under their care.The statement from the Popular Forces pledged to continue on Abu Shabab's \"path until the last terrorist is eliminated from the soil of Gaza and a bright and secure future is built for our people, who believe in peace\".In June, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming Palestinian clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas.It came after Israeli media reported that he had authorised the supply of weapons to the Popular Forces. However, the militia denied that it was being armed by Israel.The Popular Forces have been accused of looting humanitarian aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, which the militia has also denied. Reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began almost eight weeks ago, Abu Shabab had reportedly been one of several anti-Hamas militia leaders jostling for position in the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.It would involve setting up an interim government, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.Under the first phase, Hamas agreed to return all 48 living and dead hostages it was still holding in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, as well as a partial Israeli withdrawal and a surge in humanitarian aid.The body of one dead Israeli hostage is yet to be returned.Israel's government has previously said it would not join talks on the second phase until Hamas has returned all the hostages. However, Trump said on Wednesday that the second phase was \"going to happen pretty soon\".The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,120 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has warned again that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war in Ukraine.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he told India Today. Moscow controls around 85% of Donbas.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory.Putin's comments come after President Donald Trump said his negotiators discussing a US peace plan believed Russia's leader \"would like to end the war\" after Tuesday's talks in Moscow.Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who was in Moscow, is due to meet Ukraine's team in Florida.Trump said Tuesday's talks in the Kremlin were \"reasonably good\", adding it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".The original iteration of the US peace plan proposed to hand over areas of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Putin - but the Witkoff team presented a modified version in Moscow.In his India Today interview ahead of a state visit to Delhi, Putin said he had not seen the new version before his talks with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.\"That's why we had to go over every point, that's why it took so long,\" the Kremlin leader said.He also said Moscow disagreed with parts of the US plan.\"At times we said that yes, we can discuss this, but to that we can't agree,\" Putin said.He did not name the sticking points. At least two significant points of contention remain - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Putin's senior foreign policy adviser and key negotiator Yuri Ushakov earlier said straight after the talks that they produced \"no compromise\" on ending the war.Ushakov also implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to what Moscow said were its recent successes on the battlefield.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stalling any ceasefire agreements, saying Moscow is seeking to seize more Ukrainian territory.Commenting on the Kremlin talks, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia said  Putin was \"wasting the world's time\".Ukraine has long insisted on firm security guarantees for Ukraine in any deal.On Wednesday, Zelensky said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\" - but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\", which Kyiv and its European allies accuse of deliberately stalling any ceasefire agreements.The Ukrainian president said last week his top negotiators had managed to make some key changes in the original US peace plan - seen as strongly favouring Moscow - during talks with an American delegation in Geneva on 23 November.In a joint statement, US and Ukrainian negotiators said at the time that they had drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" - but provided no further details.Top negotiators from Europe - who had voiced concern over the original US plan - were also in the Swiss city last week, meeting separately with the Ukrainian and the US teams.In a separate development on Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel news website said it had obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call in which European leaders expressed concern over the US negotiations.\"There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees,\" French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said, according to an English transcript of Monday's conference call.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was quoted as warning that Zelensky had to be \"extremely careful in the coming days\".\"They are playing games, both with you and with us,\" Merz reportedly said.Finnish President Alexander Stubb was also quoted as saying: \"We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys.\"The BBC has not seen the reported transcript. In response to a Der Spiegel inquiry, France's Élysée Palace stated that \"the president did not express himself in those terms\". The presidential office declined to provide details on how Macron expressed himself, citing confidentiality.Stubb declined to comment to Der Spiegel, and Merz has not commented on the issue.In a statement to the BBC, the White House said: \"Secretary [Marco] Rubio, Special Envoy Witkoff, Mr Kushner, and the President's entire national security team are working tirelessly to stop the killing between Russia and Ukraine.\"\"They have held productive meetings to gather feedback from both sides on a plan that can foster a durable, enforceable peace,\" the statement read.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In recent weeks, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in south-east Ukraine, despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "1 day agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterAdidas has fended off an appeal from shareholders who accused it of hiding misconduct by rapper-entrepreneur Kanye West - otherwise known as Ye - before their partnership broke down in 2022.A San Francisco court said the sportswear giant did not mislead investors, who claimed they had lost money after Adidas shares plunged when it cut ties with West.The Yeezy tie-up with West had been one of Adidas' most successful partnerships, but its collapse after a spate of anti-Semitic comments by the rapper cost the brand hundreds of millions of dollars.The BBC could not reach the firm leading the class action or West's team. Adidas declined to comment.West, who is not party to the lawsuit, was widely criticised after repeatedly making antisemitic remarks and promoting conspiracy theories.His Yeezy brand collaboration with Adidas was put under review after he showed a \"White Lives Matter\" T-shirt design at a fashion show in 2022. Shortly after, he posted anti-Semitic comments online, which prompted Adidas to pull his products from sale.West's behaviour also prompted several companies, including Gap and JP Morgan, to sever ties with the rapper.Court documents filed on Wednesday show that HLSA-ILA Funds, the firm representing investors, alleged that Adidas continued its partnership with West despite knowing about his controversial conduct for years.The filing claims Adidas \"internally grappled\" with West's behaviour but misled shareholders by failing to disclose the risk in its reports.The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ultimately sided with Adidas. The court said on Wednesday that a reasonable investor would know that a partnership with a celebrity like West could come with \"inherent risks relating to improper behaviour\".A district court had previously dismissed HLSA-ILA's case, and the firm later appealed.The collapse of Adidas' partnership with West caused the German firm's share price to tank in 2023.Yeezy, luxury trainers designed by West, had been a particularly lucrative line of products for Adidas, generating around €1.5bn (£870m; $1.17bn) in sales in 2021.The partnership breakdown left Adidas with more than €1bn worth of Yeezy shoes sitting in storage. In 2023, the brand announced that it would sell those products and donate some of the proceeds to charities who worked on combating hate.",

    "body": "Cyclone catastrophe in Sri Lanka awakens volunteer spirit2 days agoIshara Danasekara,News Editor, BBC News SinhalaandKoh EweWatch: Sri Lankan communities under water after catastrophic floodingSri Lankan actor and musician GK Reginold rides a motorised fishing boat through Colombo's suburbs, hoping to bring food and water to those in desperate need.Some of the families, Mr Reginold says, have not received aid for days, isolated by the South Asian island nation's worst weather disaster in recent years.Cyclone Ditwah lashed the country last week, bringing catastrophic floods and landslides that killed more than 460 people, left hundreds missing and damaged some 30,000 homes.But the deluge has also inspired volunteerism among its people, as they face what their president has described as the \"most challenging natural disaster\" in its history.\"The main reason why I wanted to do this, is to at least help them to have one meal,\" Mr Reginold tells the BBC. \"And I was so happy that I was able to do that.\"BBC SinhalaVolunteers have been taking fishing boats out to rescue flood victims and deliver aidMore than one million people have been affected by the disaster and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency.Sri Lanka's military has deployed helicopters for rescue operations, while humanitarian aid is flowing in from foreign governments and non-governmental organisations.But it will be a long journey to recovery for Sri Lanka, which has seen its fair share of turmoil in recent years.Activists volunteer in community kitchenIn Colombo's Wijerama neighbourhood, activists who protested against former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 are now helping run a community kitchen that churns out food aid.The protests from three years ago were fuelled by a spiralling economic crisis that caused shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

    "body": "17 hours agoDavid GrittenHostages and Missing Families ForumSuthisak Rintalak was killed during the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack and his body was taken to GazaIsrael says the remains of a hostage it received from Hamas and the allied armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in Gaza have been identified as belonging to Thai agricultural worker Suthisak Rintalak.The return of the 43-year-old's body via the Red Cross on Wednesday means only one more dead hostage's body due to be handed over under the terms of the ceasefire deal now remains in Gaza.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel's government shared \"in the deep sorrow of the Rintalak family, the Thai people, and all of [the] fallen hostages' families\".It also vowed to work tirelessly to bring home the body of the last hostage, Israeli police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili, 24.Suthisak Rintalak was from the town of Rattanawapi in north-eastern Thailand.He moved to Israel in 2017 as part of a foreign worker programme and was employed on several farms in communities located near the Gaza border, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel.Israeli and Thai authorities say he had been in the orchards of Kibbutz Be'eri when he was killed in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. His body was then taken to Gaza and held hostage by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.His mother, On, told Israeli Army Radio that it was \"hard for us to digest the news\" after being informed that his body had been recovered by PIJ fighters in northern Gaza.\"Two years have passed,\" she said. \"We felt great sadness when we knew he was no longer among the living.\"Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote on X: \"For 789 painful days, Suthisak was held hostage in Gaza. His family back in Thailand have waited in agony for his return. Now, Suthisak can finally be laid to rest with dignity.\"\"Hamas's cruelty continues. Ran Gvili, a police officer who fought and fell heroically on October 7th, is still being held hostage in Gaza. When we say we won't stop until every last hostage is home, we mean it.\"A spokesperson for Thailand's foreign ministry thanked the Israeli government for the assistance that led to the return of all 31 Thai nationals who were among the 251 people taken hostage during the 7 October attack. Another 39 Thai nationals were among the 1,200 people killed that day.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.ReutersPalestinian Islamic Jihad said it had found the body of a hostage in northern GazaUnder the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of four foreign hostages - two of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.The seven-week-old ceasefire has continued to look shaky, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of repeated violations.On Wednesday night, an Israeli air strike killed five Palestinians, including two children, at a camp for displaced families in the al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, a hospital said.Israel's military said it targeted a \"Hamas terrorist\" in retaliation for an earlier attack by Hamas fighters in the Rafah area that wounded five Israeli soldiers.Hamas said the Israeli strike constituted a \"clear war crime\".Speaking to journalists at the White House, US President Donald Trump said the next stage of his Gaza peace plan - which includes plans for the post-war governance, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction - was \"going to happen pretty soon\".\"They had a problem today, I understand, with a bomb that went off,\" Trump said. \"Hurt some people pretty badly… But it's going very well. We have peace in the Middle East. People don't realise it.\"",

    "body": "Israel has announced it will open the key Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt in the coming days to allow Palestinians to leave the territory.Israeli military body Cogat said exits would be \"facilitated through co-ordination with Egypt, following security approval by Israel and under the supervision of the European Union mission\". It added that this would be \"similar to the mechanism that operated in January\", when the crossing opened during a previous ceasefire.An Israeli security official said it was an expression of Israel's support for the current ceasefire with Hamas, which began seven weeks ago.However, Egypt denied it was co-ordinating with Israel to reopen the Rafah crossing.The State Information Service cited an official Egyptian source as saying that \"if an agreement is reached to open the crossing, it will be in both directions, to enter and exit the Gaza Strip, in accordance with the plan of US President Donald Trump\".Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan states that \"opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism\" implemented under the January ceasefire deal.The crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. Before then, it was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the conflict and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. At least 16,500 severely ill or injured Palestinians in need of lifesaving medical treatment abroad are currently waiting to be evacuated from Gaza, according to the World Health Organization. It says only 235 patients, almost all of them children, have been evacuated via crossings with Israel since the ceasefire took effect.Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that Palestinian Authority (PA) forces would assist in operating the reopened Rafah crossing alongside the EU's Border Assistance Mission.It cited a European source as saying Palestinian representatives had also helped during the previous ceasefire but without wearing PA insignia due to \"Israeli sensitivity\" over their presence in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any role in the future governance of the territory for the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.Haaretz also reported that Netanyahu had so far blocked the reopening of the Rafah crossing because of the delayed return of the bodies of deceased hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza.Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian. In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.One of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli – Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is a Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.The Israeli prime minister's office said on Wednesday morning that forensic testing had shown that human remains handed over by Hamas in Gaza the previous day did not belong to either of the two men.On Wednesday afternoon, the military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, said it had recovered the body of a hostage in northern Gaza. The body will be transferred later to Israeli forces via the Red Cross, according to Hamas's military wing.The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "The EU's former foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has been accused of fraud as part of an EU investigation into the misuse of funds, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) has said.The EPPO said searches were carried out on Tuesday at the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, headed by Ms Mogherini, as well as the European External Action Service (EEAS) in Brussels - the office she ran for five years as the bloc's top diplomat.The investigation relates to EU-funded training for junior diplomats, the EPPO said. As well as Ms Mogherini, a senior College of Europe staff member and a senior official from the European Commission were detained, the prosecutor's office added.According to the EPPO, the three were formally told of the allegations against them: \"the accusations concern procurement fraud and corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy.\"The three accused were all subsequently released as they were not considered a flight risk and their homes were also searched.After a reported 10 hours of questioning, Ms Mogherini issued a statement saying she had \"clarified my position with the investigators\", adding that, \"in its long tradition, the College has always applied and will continue to apply the highest standards of integrity and fairness\".\"I have full confidence in the justice system, and I trust that the correctness of the College's actions will be ascertained. I will obviously continue to offer my full collaboration to the authorities,\" she said.Under Belgian law, a person can be arrested then released without being charged, while remaining a suspect.The EPPO said the investigation focused on a tender that the EEAS awarded to the College of Europe in 2021-2022. It added that there were \"strong suspicions\" of favouritism related to the tender for  a nine-month training course for junior diplomats.The EPPO, which investigates alleged crimes against the financial interests of the EU, did not name the three people questioned but said the immunity of several suspects had been lifted as part of the investigation.The College of Europe is an independent school attended by aspiring EU civil servants. It is closely associated with and partly funded by the EU. ",

    "body": "Suspect arrested in pipe bomb incident on eve of 2021 Capitol riot5 hours agoNadine YousifBBC NewsWatch: FBI releases new video in hunt for 6 January pipe bomb suspectA Virginia man has been arrested in connection with two pipe bombs placed outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees on the eve of the 2021 Capitol riot.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Brian Cole Jr, 30, was arrested without incident early on Thursday morning. He is charged with use of an explosive device and attempted malicious destruction by means of explosive materials. Officials did not specify a possible motive for the planting of the pipe bombs, which were safely deactivated without exploding.It caps an exhaustive investigation in a case where an arrest had eluded law enforcement despite a $500,000 (£375,000) reward. The FBI did not receive new information or a tip that cracked the case, officials said. Both bombs were placed on the night of 5 January 2021 and were only discovered the following afternoon as supporters of Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol in the last days of his first presidency. Kamala Harris, who was the US vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the Democratic National Committee headquarters shortly after the devices were found.According to court documents, the suspect lives with his parents in Woodbridge, a suburb about 20 miles (32km) outside Washington.He works for a bail bond company - such firms help people get out of jail by posting bail on their behalf in exchange for a non-refundable fee.US Department of JusticeInvestigators sifted through a mountain of evidence gathered over the years, including some three million lines of data.Mr Cole allegedly bought multiple bomb-making components in 2019 and 2020, according to the court filing.He purchased metal end caps, wires and steel wool at Home Depot and Lowes hardware stores, batteries at another retailer and timers at a Walmart in northern Virginia, an FBI affidavit states.Investigators found mobile phone data that showed Mr Cole was near the locations of the pipe bombs when they were planted between 19:39 and 20:24 local time on 5 January 2021.Watch: Aerial video shows FBI at pipe bomb suspect's homeHis car - a 2017 Nissan Sentra with a Virginia licence plate - was also seen by a licence plate reader less than half a mile (0.8km) from the location where the individual who placed the devices was first observed in the area.US Attorney Jeanine Pirro told a news conference on Thursday that the Trump administration had made solving the case a priority.\"It was like finding a needle in a haystack,\" she said.Investigators said both pipe bombs were manufactured using end caps, with Pirro adding there were 233,000 black-end caps of the type used in the plot. \"I want you to think about the act that the FBI had to go through the sale of every one of them,\" she added.The suspect's shoes were believed to be Nike Air Max Speed Turfs.The FBI discovered thousands of pairs of the shoes had been distributed through more than two dozen retailers.Watch: Attorney General Pam Bondi announces charges against pipe bomb suspectFBI officials praised the perseverance of agents and said they never gave up on finding a suspect. \"We continued to churn through massive amounts of data\", said Darren Cox, deputy assistant director of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division.Earlier this year, the FBI released CCTV footage of an individual with a backpack and light grey hooded sweater placing something near a bench outside the DNC building in Washington. The person was shown later walking to place the second bomb.FBI Director Kash Patel told the news conference that \"when you attack American citizens, when you attack our nation's capital, you attack the very being of our way of life\".\"We will provide the safest country the nation has ever seen,\" he added.FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the case showed people are not able to \"walk into our capital city\", plant devices and \"walk off into the sunset\", adding that US law enforcement will \"track you down to the end of the earth\".The pipe bomb plot spawned countless conspiracy theories, including that US law enforcement might have been involved.Before he took the job of FBI deputy director, Bongino floated the possibility last year that it was an \"inside job\" and a \"massive cover-up.\"",

The alert reached people nearly 200 miles away in the San Francisco Bay Area, triggering automatic warnings advising residents to drop for cover.However, the agency then cancelled the alert minutes later and removed the corresponding entry from its website.\"There was no M5.9 earthquake near Carson City, NV,\" the USGS said on X.The USGS said the alert originated from its automatic earthquake detection system, which had erroneously generated the report. It said it was believed to be the first time the agency has issued a completely false earthquake notification.An investigation is under way to determine what caused the malfunction.Multiple law enforcement agencies in cities and counties near the reported epicentre confirmed the absence of any ground movement.A magnitude 5.9 earthquake is typically strong enough to cause noticeable shaking and slight property damage, according to the Michigan Tech Earthquake Magnitude Scale.",

    "body": "8 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentWatch: Which countries are boycotting Eurovision and why?Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and Slovenia will boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, after Israel was allowed to compete. They were among a number of countries who had called for Israel to be excluded over the war in Gaza, as well as accusations of unfair voting practices.Spanish broadcaster RTVE led calls for a secret ballot on the issue at a meeting in Geneva. It said organisers denied that request - a decision that \"increased [our] distrust of the festival's organisation\".Ireland's RTÉ said it felt that its \"participation remains unconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there which continues to put the lives of so many civilians at risk.\"ReutersSinger Yuval Raphael, who survived the 7 October Hamas attack in 2023, represented Israel at this year's EurovisionSpain is one of Eurovision's \"Big Five\" countries along with France, Germany, Italy and the UK. Their artists are allowed straight into the final, as their broadcasters provide the largest financial contribution to the EBU. Approximately 50 broadcasters, including the BBC, attended a meeting of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) on Thursday to discuss the future of the contest, which is watched by more than 150 million people each year.They were asked to back new rules intended to discourage governments and third parties from organising voting campaigns for their acts, after allegations that Israel unfairly boosted its entrant, Yuval Raphael, this year.BBC News understands that voting to accept those measures was tied to a clause whereby members agreed not to proceed with a vote on Israel's participation.\"This vote means that all EBU Members who wish to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 and agree to comply with the new rules are eligible to take part,\" the EBU said.Getty ImagesAustrian singer JJ won May's contest in Basel, Switzerland, toppling Israel from pole position at the last minuteMartin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said he was \"pleased\" that members had been given an \"opportunity to debate\" Israel's place in the contest before the vote. \"It was a full, frank and honest and quite moving debate, but as we can see from the emphatic result, they really came together on a belief that the Eurovision Song Contest shouldn't be used as a political theatre, it must retain some sense of neutrality.\"Israel's President Isaac Herzog praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it \"an appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation, symbolising a victory over those who seek to silence Israel and spread hatred\".He said he was \"glad that Israel will participate again in Eurovision and I hope that the competition will remain one that sanctifies culture, poetry, and friendship between peoples and cross-border cultural understanding\". He added that Israel \"deserves to be represented on every stage in the world, and I am fully and actively committed to that\".The CEO of Israel's broadcaster, KAN, said the attempt to disqualify its entry \"can only be understood as a cultural boycott.\"A boycott may begin today - with Israel - but no-one knows where it will end or who else it may harm,\" said Golan Yochpaz. \"Is this what we truly want this contest to be remembered for on its 70th anniversary?\"The BBC, which broadcasts Eurovision in the UK, said in a statement: \"We support the collective decision made by members of the EBU. This is about enforcing the rules of the EBU and being inclusive.\"Getty ImagesSpanish singer Melody representing Spain in May's contest, with the song Esa divaHowever, the decision has exposed a deep rift in the Eurovision community. In a statement, Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said that \"participation under the current circumstances is incompatible with the public values ​​that are essential to us\".Spanish broadcaster RTVE added: \"The board of directors of RTVE agreed last September that Spain would withdraw from Eurovision if Israel was part of it.\"\"This withdrawal also means that RTVE will not broadcast the Eurovision 2026 final... nor the preliminary semi-finals.\"Slovenia's broadcaster RTV added that their position also \"remains unchanged\". \"The recent rule changes do not alter our view. As a public service broadcaster, RTV Slovenia is committed to upholding ethical principles and expects that equal rules and standards apply to all EBU members and all participating countries.\"Belgium's broadcaster said it would \"take a position in the coming days\".Those who approved of the changes included Nordic broadcasters from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland who issued a joint statement saying they \"supported\" the EBU's decision to \"address critical shortcomings\" in the voting system.Despite that, Iceland's RÚV said it would not make a final decision on its participation until next week. Germany, which had threatened to leave the contest if Israel was removed, also welcomed Thursday's decision.Its broadcaster ARD said it was \"looking forward to participating\" next year, \"embracing it as a celebration of cultural diversity and solidarity\". It added: \"At the same time, we deeply regret the decisions of individual EBU members to withdraw from the ESC 2026 but, of course, respect the choices made by the respective broadcasters.\"",

    "body": "14 minutes agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday, in his insistence that the US needs Greenland for national security reasons. Is he prepared to use force to seize it, journalists asked him? \"No comment,\" said the president, sending chills down the spine of Greenland's anxious inhabitants. Again.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato. President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums. Especially those reliant on exporting to the US, like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said, \"we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed\" after an emergency meeting with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence to criticise \"lies\" about their clients. Jessica and Jacques Moretti were  \"devastated\", the lawyers told local media, but denied being aware of any dangers at their venue.\"There is a sort of public vindictiveness directed against them,\" one of the three lawyers, Yaël Hayat, said.Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling of the basement of Le Constellation bar in the popular ski resort of Crans-Montana. Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are being treated in hospital for severe burns.Many stories about the couple, the venue they managed, as well as their past have circulated in the local media since the fire, increasing pressure on the authorities as they investigate the accident and prosecute the owners.In an interview with Tribune de Geneve, the lawyers said the couple wanted to \"restore the truth\".Hayat said reports her client Jessica had left the burning building with cash from the register were a lie, telling BFMTV: \"In no way did she leave the scene in a hurry; she stayed there to help and support the injured.\"Patrick Michod, representing Jacques Moretti, said: \"When you run an establishment and a tragedy like this occurs, you feel responsible. Now, the major question in this case is the question of criminal responsibility, which is obviously not the same thing as the feelings one may have as the operator.\"Asked about the foam in the ceiling, Michod said his client obtained the material from a \"major construction retailer\" which did not disclose that it was flammable. \"He did not want to install a highly flammable foam. He wanted to install acoustic foam,\" he said. Lawyers representing the family of Cyane Panine, a staff member at Le Constellation who died in the blaze, said she had received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught fire. Hayat described Panine as a close friend of the couple, and pulled out a postcard she said had been written by her to the Morettis, Tribune de Geneve reported. \"I hope I will continue to grow alongside you and that we will spend many more New Year's Eves together [...] you are like my second family,\" the postcard said.The Moretti couple have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Last week, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued the couple present a flight risk and have asked judges to impose a 400,000-franc bail ($500,000; £374,000)as a condition for their release - 200,000 for each.Michod said that he had filed a request to release Jacques Moretti.

    "body": "Three shark attacks have been reported in Sydney in a little over 24 hours, leaving at least two people seriously injured, according to local authorities.A man was taken to hospital in critical condition after being injured at Manly beach on Monday evening, New South Wales Police said in a statement.Hours earlier, an 11-year-old surfer had to be assisted off Sydney's Dee Why Beach after a suspected shark bit his surfboard, with the local council urging swimmers and surfers to be cautious.The first incident saw a 12-year-old boy taken to hospital with critical injuries after he was attacked by a large shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon, police said.The boy and his group of friends were jumping off a six-metre rock ledge at Shark Beach, in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse, when the attack happened on Sunday.Despite its name, shark attacks are rare at Shark Beach, a popular swimming spot.The boy was pulled out of the water by his friends before rescuers arrived. Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,\" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.\"Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.\"Marine police arrived to a \"horrendous scene\", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least five fatal shark attacks in the country last year.",

    "body": "1 day agoNick BeakeEurope correspondent, in BrusselsIt's not yet a full year since European leaders buckled up for President Trump's second term, and now this rollercoaster ride feels it has reached its most dangerous turn yet.The occupant on the White House is dangling the threat of economic punishment over the heads of countries that are supporting the territorial integrity of an EU member, Denmark. Leaders will hold an emergency EU summit about this in the coming days. If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US.If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force?French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's \"trade bazooka\" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts.There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power.They were thinking of China, not the US.In the here and now, some EU leaders are wary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump.She has spoken of a \"problem of understanding and communication\" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood.If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat.Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis.Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts.It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it.EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous.Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic.But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.",

Two other pupils remains in critical condition.The minibus driver crashed into the lorry after attempting to overtake two vehicles, police spokesperson Mavela Masondo said.Masondo added that a case of culpable homicide would be opened.The minibus driver was \"reportedly\" being treated in hospital, Gauteng province's department of education said, while the details of what happened to the lorry driver were \"uncertain\".Fatal road collisions are common in South Africa, due to factors such as rampant speeding, reckless driving and poorly maintained vehicles.In 2025, 11,418 people died in crashes - about 6% lower than a year earlier but still equivalent to an average of 31 deaths a day.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Monday's crash \"distressing\". \"Our children are the nation's most precious assets and we must do all we can – from observing the rules of the road to the quality of service providers appointed to transport scholars – to protect learners,\" the president added.",

Sanchez also promised to get to the bottom of why the two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, as rescuers continue to search the wreckage.More than 120 more people were injured as carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening.The crash is the worst the country has seen in more than a decade.Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, according to Transport Minister Óscar Puente. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Sanchez visited the site of the crash with senior officials on Monday afternoon.\"This is a day of sorrow for all of Spain, for our entire country,\" he told reporters.\"We are going to get to the truth, we are going to find the answer, and when that answer about the origin and cause of this tragedy is known, as it could not be otherwise, with absolute transparency and absolute clarity, we will make it public.\"Puente said an investigation could take at least a month, describing the incident as \"extremely strange\".ReutersRescuers are still searching the wreckage at the crash siteEPAPedro Sánchez travelled to Spain to pay tribute to the people killedBut Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed source briefed on initial investigations as saying experts had found a faulty joint on the rails, which was causing a gap between rail sections to widen as trains travelled over it. They added that the joint was key to identifying the cause of the accident.Spain's El País newspaper said it was not clear whether the fault was a cause or a result of the crash.Four hundred passengers and staff were on board the two trains, the rail authorities said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 41, including children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 are in intensive care.Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\". Officials are working to identify the dead.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters.Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\".\"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"All high-speed services between Madrid and the southern cities of Malaga, Cordoba, Sevilla and Huelva have been suspended until Friday.Watch: Footage inside Spanish train as passengers evacuate from crashKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\" and offered their \"most heartfelt condolences\". The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country. Adif data shows the Spanish rail is more than 4,000km long (2,485 miles).Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

According to a United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs report, 400,000 people have been affected.In South Africa, more than 30 people have died in just two provinces since November, according to the government.Mozambique has declared a red alert in the wake of the devastating floods while South Africa has announced a national disaster.The rainy season has begun in central and northern Mozambique, with further heavy rain forecast across large parts of the country, which is entering its annual cyclone season.",

    "body": "China's birth rates sunk to a record low in 2025, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost it, as the country's population fell for the fourth straight year.Government data on Monday showed that the country's birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968.Its population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year.Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children.In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021.More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.",

    "body": "Goodbye gator, see you later: San Francisco mourns its beloved albino alligator 6 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesClaude in his enclosure at the California Academy of Sciences in 2023Claude wasn't much of a talker, he barely moved, and never wore a costume to entice his audience - but on Sunday, hundreds gathered in San Francisco to celebrate the life and legacy of the city's beloved albino alligator.A New Orleans-style brass band, a gator-shaped eight-foot-long white sourdough bread, drag queen story time and even a street officially bearing his name, Claude the Alligator Way, the memorial was one of its kind.The reptile sure won millions of hearts when he was alive, but he was also remembered for stealing from a 12-year-old girl. The 10-foot-long, 300-pound white alligator with pink eyes and poor eyesight once stole - and then gobbled- the girl's ballet shoe, recalled Bart Shepherd of the California Academy of Sciences, Claude's home for 17 years before his death in December.\"It's no small feat to get a shoe out of an alligator,\" Shepherd told a crowd of Claude's fans in Golden Gate Park.It took a lot of anaesthesia, specialised tools, and multiple vets and staff members to extract the shoe from inside Claude - a task that was completed successfully, despite a fire alarm going off throughout the building at the time, Shepherd said. Heidi Alletzhauser/California Academy of Sciences Press Office\"It was really heartening to see San Francisco come out to celebrate this beloved San Francisco icon,\" Jeanette Peach, the communications director at the academy, told the BBC. Part of why people loved Claude so much, Peach said, was that he \"embodied something that we think of as a really San Francisco ideal, which is not just accepting but welcoming people for their differences\".Claude's albinism, which is extremely rare in alligators, provided visibility for people who feel a little outcast, Peach said. \"Here is this wonderful animal who is a little outcast from how the rest of his species is, but who is beloved and treasured and has value,\" she added.

Claude \"delighted and captivated more than 22 million visitors and showed us the power of ambassador animals to connect people with nature and science\", the academy wrote on its website. The reptile, who died from liver cancer at the age of 30 in December, hatched in 1995 at an alligator farm in Louisiana before coming to live at the academy's swamp exhibit in 2008. Since his passing, the academy has received thousands of letters from Claude's fans, writing to say how much the alligator meant to them. \"Thank you for inspiring so many young children over the years,\" one of Claude's visitors wrote in a note to him. \"You reminded us that our differences are what make us unique and special and that they are something to be celebrated.\"\"You will forever be in my heart,\" another wrote. \"I will miss you so much and thank you for being a part of my childhood.\"Heidi Alletzhauser/California Academy of Sciences Press OfficeLana Krol, a senior veterinarian at the academy, said that out of all the alligators she's worked with, Claude \"struck me as the most laidback of them all\". \"I can say with confidence that I won't meet another gator like Claude in my lifetime. I'll miss him terribly,\" Krol said. Heidi Alletzhauser/California Academy of Sciences Press Office",

They are then put in gated compounds, have their documents confiscated and are compelled to engage in cyber-crime.They often work on romance scams, where a victim is encouraged to send money to a fictitious partner who they believe is real, or business email compromise, where someone poses as an employer and gets people to sends funds or sensitive data.The weekend's operation was jointly co-ordinated by a host of agencies, including the Cyber Security Authority (CSA).''All the arrested individuals have been duly profiled and handed over to the Ghana Immigration Service for safekeeping and further investigations,\" Communications Minister Sam George said in a post on X.\"We caution foreign nationals invited to Ghana to verify claims made by their fellow nationals to lure them here.''George also indicated that suspects arrested in previous recent operations have been handed over to Nigerian law enforcement or are facing prosecution.The CSA and other agencies have been making efforts to flush out cyber-criminals, including working with the US authorities to arrest high-profile suspects. Among recent operations was the arrest of a popular Ghanaian social media influencer known as Abu Trica, whose real name is Frederick Kumi, who allegedly stole $8m (£5.9m) from vulnerable Americans through a romance scam. He has not yet commented on the allegations.Another successful operation was the dismantling of a syndicate that defrauded over 200 victims of $400,000 (£300,000).You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcastsMore from the BBC",

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will dissolve parliament on Friday, paving the way for an early election on 8 February that she hopes will translate her strong public polling into a big majority in the lower house.It was an \"extremely weighty decision\" that would \"determine Japan's course together with the people\", Takaichi told a news conference in Tokyo.The country's first female leader and her cabinet have enjoyed high public support since taking office last October.But her party lags behind in polls and the move is risky. It's Japan's second general election in as many years and will test appetite for her plans to boost public spending when cost-of-living is top of voters' minds.Having been elected as prime minister by lawmakers on 21 October, Takaichi is now seeking a public mandate in the House of Representatives, the more powerful house in Japan.Since the day she took office, Takaichi said, she has been \"constantly concerned that the Takaichi cabinet has not yet been tested in an election where the public chooses the government\".\"Is Sanae Takaichi fit to be prime minister? I wanted to ask the sovereign people to decide,\" she told the news conference.Campaigning for the vote to elect the 465 lower house MPs, who serve four-year terms, starts on 27 January.Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955. It currently has 199 seats - including three held by its independent partners - in the House of Representatives, the most of any party. The LDP's coalition with the Japan Innovation party gives it a fragile majority, with just enough seats to govern. A protege of former conservative PM Shinzo Abe and self-professed admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known as Japan's \"Iron Lady\". She came into office promising an economic upturn after years of stagnation.Takaichi is an advocate of heavy government-led spending to drive economic growth - a revival of the sort of stimulus measures that Japan saw under \"Abenomics\". Her first few months in office have seen soaring personal poll ratings - no Japanese PM has been popular since Abe, in 2012.In December, her cabinet approved a record defence budget of nine trillion yen ($57bn; £43bn). This comes amid growing concern over China, with Tokyo describing its neighbour's military activities in the region as its \"greatest strategic challenge\".Takaichi has found herself the target of China's ire since last November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. The diplomatic spat that ensued has sent bilateral ties plunging to their lowest point in more than a decade.Meanwhile, Takaichi has pursued closer ties with the US. During US President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last October, the two leaders heaped praise on each other and signed a deal on rare earths. They also signed a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations.Opinion polls show that while the LDP remains broadly unpopular among Japanese residents, Takaichi and her government have charted approval ratings of 60-80%.This popularity is what Takaichi hopes can help the LDP secure a \"sole majority\" in parliament and push through bolder policies more easily, Dr Seijiro Takeshita, a management professor at the University of Shizuoka, told the BBC World Service's Asia Specific podcast.\"She wants to solidify her position to make things smoother at a later stage,\" Takeshita said.But the snap election gamble comes with its own set of risks.The LDP's leadership has been on shaky ground, and Takaichi is the country's fourth PM in five years. Her predecessors' terms were cut short by falling public support and scandals.Her immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, also announced a snap election shortly after taking office - leading to one of the LDP's worst ever results and costing the party its majority in the House of Representatives.Another challenge looms in the form of a new, consolidated opposition, the Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed last week by Japan's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and the Komeito party, the LDP's former coalition partner.Takaichi said the dissolution of parliament was being carried out only \"after establishing a thorough system\" which ensures there is no disruption to economic policies affecting livelihoods and rising prices.What Takaichi is hoping for is that \"people will trust her to deliver on her promises\", Dr Jeffrey Kingston, an Asian studies professor at Temple University in the US, told the BBC.Her high approval ratings are \"only going to decline so she wants to lock in the benefits of a long honeymoon\", he added.",

    "body": "14 hours agoThomas MackintoshReutersGwyneth Paltrow and Valentino Garavani pose at the West Coast premiere of the documentary Valentino: The Last Emperor in 2009Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani, known as Valentino, has died at the age of 93.One of the giants of 20th Century fashion, Valentino's creations were worn by celebrities and well-known figures including Elizabeth Taylor, Nancy Reagan, Sharon Stone, Julia Roberts and Gwyneth Paltrow.He co-founded the Valentino fashion house in 1960 and ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld at the top of the profession.In a statement posted on Instagram, the Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti Foundation said: \"He passed away peacefully in his Roman home, surrounded by the love of his family.\"The foundation said Valentino will be lying in state at Rome's Piazza Mignanelli between 21 and 22 January.Valentino's funeral service will be held the following day at the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels and Martyrs, the foundation said.Born in Lombardy in May 1932, Valentino was known for his collections that displayed luxury, wealth and opulence.Watch: 'I used to do 30, 40 drawings in one day' - Valentino in BBC interview from 2012He moved to Paris to study at the ​​Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne when he was just 17, and went on to work with designers Jacques Fath, Balenciaga, Jean Dessès and Guy Laroche.His adoption of his signature colour \"Valentino red\", inspired by a trip to Spain, helped elevate the brand to global fame with the debut of the iconic fiesta dress.It became so meaningful for the house that for Valentino's last collection in 2008 all the models wore red dresses for the finale.Valentino designed the wedding dress of Princess Madeleine of Sweden when she married British-American financier Christopher O'Neill in June 2013.In December 2023, he was honoured with the outstanding achievement award at the British Fashion Awards which were held at London's Royal Albert Hall.AFP via Getty ImagesValentino pictured with English model and actress Elizabeth Hurley at a New York restaurant in 1997AFP via Getty ImagesValentino's creations made him the designer of choice for the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy OnassisAlexandra Shulman, the former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that every aspect of Valentino \"epitomised glamour and luxury\".\"It is very sad news because he was one of the last of the great designers of the modern day and I think his main contribution will be that he was what people wanted a fashion designer to be,\" Shulman said.\"He really didn't care that much that he wasn't the most fashionable, the most cutting-edge designer, he just wanted to produce clothes that were beautiful - and they were.\"He also kept his celebrity customers for a long time, he started off with people like Jacqueline Kennedy who wore Valentino when she was in mourning.\"AFP via Getty ImagesValentino in New York in 2019Shulman listed a number of Hollywood stars who have been big supporters of Valentino's designs over the last 15 years - including Paltrow, Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Lopez.\"He was helped in later years by the red carpet [becoming] such a thing, because that's what his clothes were about,\" Shulman added.\"They weren't something you slipped on to go to the office - they were really fabulous gowns.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosandAlicia CurryReutersAt least 40 people have died and dozens more have been injured after two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, local authorities have said.The incident near the city of Córdoba has been described by local officials as Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the scene on Monday, where he announced a three-day mourning period.Here's what we know about the incident so far.Follow live updatesWhere did the crash happen?The crash occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid.The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said.It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added.What caused the crash?Watch: Footage inside Spanish train as passengers evacuateWhat caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.Puente has described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error.Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it.He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. Fernández Heredia suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause.Meanwhile, at a news conference during his visit to Adamuz, Prime Minister Sánchez vowed to uncover the cause of the crash and thanked emergency workers  for their help \"in a moment of such pain and tragedy\".Are people still trapped in the trains?Spanish Guardia Civil / Handout via ReutersThe Spanish Civil Guard arrived on scene to assess the situation and begin the evaluation processThere were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Renfe, according to a statement from Renfe.It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. \"The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,\" Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.\"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,\" he added.The president of the Andalusian regional government, Juanma Moreno, told local outlet Canal Sur that they are waiting for \"heavy machinery\" to \"practically lift\" parts of the second train, which \"has taken the worst part of this accident\".\"Until the heavy machinery can do its job and free the wagons from the track\", emergency services will not be able to start \"searching and identifying\" any remaining victims, he added.Who are the victims?The 39 victims of the crash have not yet been identified, with Puente saying the death toll \"is not yet final\" as investigations into the crash commence.As of Monday afternoon, 122 people had received medical assistance, 48 of whom remained hospitalised, local emergency services said.Among the 48 victims still in hospital, five are under the age of 18.Moreno said teams are working to identify those who have died. What have the survivors said?Spain train crash survivors describe 'absolutely terrifying' scenePassengers on board the Madrid-bound train described the moment of impact feeling like an \"earthquake\" and said it shattered the train's windows, displaced luggage and threw people to the floor. \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" journalist Salvador Jimenez told Canal Sur.\"There were people screaming, calling for doctors,\" he added.Another passenger, Lucas Meriako, told Spanish broadcaster La Sexta Noticias he was in the fifth carriage of the same train when he started to \"feel some banging\" that got louder and louder.\"Another train passed us and everything started vibrating. There was a jolt behind us and the feeling that the whole train was going to fall apart,\" he described.",

    "body": "1 hour agoTiffanie Turnbull,SydneyandKoh EweA surfer has been bitten by a shark, the fourth attack along Australia's New South Wales (NSW) coastline in under 48 hours.The 39-year-old man \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board on the Mid North Coast on Tuesday morning, police said. He has been released from hospital.It follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney's northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police. The attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for shark attacks. Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.The attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279 miles) north of Sydney.Steve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was \"very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries\", ABC reported. \"We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it's obviously an area where sharks congregate,\" Pearce said. \"If it's dirty water I'd think twice about going in there.\"A young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with \"life-changing\" injuries. On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was also critically injured when bitten at a popular Sydney Harbour beach.Authorities believe bull sharks were involved in most of the recent attacks.Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.Last November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach, also on the NSW Mid North coast.Bull sharks are typically seen around Sydney in January and February - the summer months in Australia - as the \"water is at their preferred temperature\", Dr Daryl McPhee, associate professor of environmental science at Bond University, told the BBC.Though Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute - making this string of shark attacks in NSW a rare phenomenon. \"This series of bites from bull sharks in such a short period of time is highly unusual,\" said McPhee.Police on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility.\"I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time,\" Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters.Rain can concentrate fish that bull sharks prey on downstream in rivers and beaches, McPhee said, adding that \"bull sharks are well adapted to feeding in murky water after rain\". \"Where you find the fish, you find the bull sharks. Unfortunately, that sometimes occurs at popular beach locations.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoTinshui YeungJapan motorway crash involving 56 cars leaves one person deadA pile-up involving at least 50 vehicles on a highway in central Japan has left two people dead and 26 injured, according to police.The incident was caused by a crash between two trucks, sparking a chain reaction that set at least 10 vehicles on fire, local police said.A 77-year-old woman from Tokyo was killed, and another body was discovered in the driver's seat of a burnt-out truck. Five people were seriously injured and 21 suffered minor injuries, police said.There was a heavy snow warning in place at the time of the crash. Police believe icy surfaces likely caused the trucks to skid on the roads.The crash happened on the Kan-etsu Expressway in Minakami, Gunma prefecture, about 160km (100 miles) north-west of Tokyo, at about 19:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on 26 December.It took about seven and a half hours to put out the fire, police said. Following the incident, a section of the highway was closed, with a long line of vehicles, many charred beyond recognition, stuck in the outbound lane. Work is under way to tow them away.A man in his 60s, whose vehicle was involved in the accident, told local media outlet NHK he heard a loud explosion from the far end of the pile-up and saw fire during the crash. The blaze then spread to other vehicles, he said.He said he was evacuated to a nearby toll gate with about 50 other people and spent the night in the hallway there.Nexco, which operates the road, said checks were needed to see if the surface was damaged by the fire.The company is warning travellers not to use the highway.",

    "body": "An explosion has killed at least eight people and injured 18 others during Friday prayers inside a mosque in the Syrian city of Homs, the health ministry has said.Pictures from Syria's state-run news agency, Sana, show the inside of the Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque with black, scorched walls, smashed windows and blood on the carpet.Officials believe that an explosive was detonated inside the building, Sana reports, citing a security source. While authorities are still searching for the perpetrators, jihadist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah said it was behind the explosion.The mosque is in the Wadi al-Dhahab neighbourhood, where most people are part of the Alawite ethnoreligious group. Syria's Foreign Ministry condemned the \"terrorist crime\", writing in a statement on X that the \"cowardly act is a blatant assault on human and moral values\" designed to \"undermine the security and stability\" of the country.Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah, a Sunni extremist group, has said it carried out the attack in collaboration with another unidentified group, using explosives planted at the site.The group's vague origins and opaque affiliations, which came to prominence in June when it said it was behind a deadly church bombing in Damascus, have raised questions about its true links and authenticity. Some observers have speculated that it could be a front for Islamic State group (IS) given the similarity in their messaging and type of targets.The latest claim follows a months-long lull in Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah's claimed attacks, which have largely taken the form of alleged targeted killings of minorities and what the group describes as \"remnants\" of the former Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.The blast comes a year after Syrian rebel forces overthrew Assad, who is Alawite. The sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam whose members make up one of the country's biggest religious minorities.Since then, Syria has seen several waves of sectarian violence, with Alawites fearing reprisals and being subject to crackdowns. Assad fled to Russia, an ally of his regime, where he and his family have been given asylum.In March, security forces were accused of killing dozens of Alawites in the coastal province of Latakia, war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring ",

    "body": "Four hikers who went missing on Christmas Day have been found dead after being buried by an avalanche in the Vardousia Mountains in central Greece.The bodies of three men and a woman were found on Friday evening after a large-scale search in the mountainous region of Fokida, according to Greek state broadcaster ERT.Fire authorities located the bodies partially covered by snow on a steep and inaccessible slope near the summit of Korakas peak, at an altitude of about 2,000m (6,561ft). Rescue officials said the group was swept away by an avalanche.Authorities said the hikers had begun their ascent in favourable weather, but conditions quickly worsened due to the altitude and the area's terrain.Vasilis Vathrakogiannis, a spokesperson for the Hellenic Fire Service, told the BBC the alarm was raised by a friend of the three men after they failed to return at the expected time.\"Weather conditions were extremely difficult, with low temperatures and poor visibility,\" he said, adding this made it hard for both drones and a helicopter to detect anything.He said a fire service ground team later found the bodies of the three men and a woman, who was confirmed to be a friend of one of them and had not been expected to take part in the climb.Recovery efforts were under way on Saturday, in what officials described as an extremely challenging operation. One of the bodies was successfully airlifted by helicopter. Efforts continue to move the remaining three to a nearby plateau so they can be recovered using a winch. Haris Asariotakis, head of the Hellenic Rescue Team mission at the scene, said the location was particularly difficult.\"It is about three hours from the village of Athanasios Diakos, at an altitude of 2,000m,\" he said. \"If the helicopter is unable to reach the area, we will descend on foot together with firefighters and mountain guides.\"Additional reporting by Kostas Koukoumakas",

    "body": "Italian police have arrested nine people accused of raising around €7m (£6m) for Hamas over more than two years.The money was ostensibly collected as humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians, a police statement said, but was instead sent to the militant group via a \"complex fundraising system\".Alongside the arrests, police say they have seized more than €8m (£7m) in assets as part of the investigation. Police say the suspects are \"specifically accused of carrying out financing operations believed to have contributed to terrorist activities\".The arrests were made as part of a joint initiative between Italy's counter-terror police and financial police.The investigation began after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack in southern Israel. Police say they analysed \"a series of reports of suspicious financial transactions\" involving some of the suspects in the lead up to the attack.Investigators uncovered a \"complex\" system of fundraising, which was headquartered in Genoa with branches in Milan, the statement adds.\"The suspects collected donations intended for the civilian population of Gaza, however, it emerged that over 71% of these funds were diverted to Hamas's coffers to finance its military wing and support the families of suicide bombers or those detained for terrorism,\" the police statement says.Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the most well-known of the arrested suspects was Mohammad Hannoun, the president of the Palestinian Association in Italy.Mr Hannoun has previously described allegations he is a financier of Hamas as a \"lie\". Piantedosi thanked police for their work in a post on X, but also noted that \"the presumption of innocence... must always be recognised at this stage\".",

    "body": "20 hours agoRaffi BergMagen David AdomThe attacker drove into people and then carried out a stabbing several miles away, police sayTwo people have been killed in what police say was a \"rolling terror attack\" in northern Israel.Police said the attacker ran over a pedestrian in the eastern city of Beit Shean, then drove on before stabbing a woman near Ein Harod, about 8 miles (12.5km) to the west. The suspect was eventually shot and wounded by a civilian outside the city of Afula, according to police.Shimshon Mordechai, a 68-year-old man, was killed and a 16-year-old boy was hurt in Friday's ramming, officials said, while the stabbing victim was Aviv Maor, aged 18.A day before the attack, an Israeli reservist was fired after video emerged of him ramming a praying Palestinian with a quad bike. The suspect in the attack came from the village of Qabatiya, in the northern occupied West Bank, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.Following the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was preparing to carry out an operation in the Qabatiya area. Katz said he had instructed the IDF to act \"forcefully and immediately\". The IDF said the suspect had \"infiltrated into Israeli territory several days ago\".Israel's Kan News public broadcaster said the 37-year-old man had been working illegally in Israel and had used his employer's vehicle in the attack.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed \"deepest condolences\" to the victims' families.In a post on X, he also praised \"the heroic citizen who neutralised the terrorist\".The incident comes a day after the army reservist drove a quad bike into a Palestinian man who was praying on a roadside in the West Bank.Video shows the man, dressed in civilian clothes but with a firearm, ramming the victim with the vehicle. Reports say the victim was unhurt. The Israeli military said the soldier - who had earlier opened fire in a nearby village - had been fired and his weapon confiscated.Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians have surged in the West Bank in recent years, according to the United Nations, with more than a thousand killed since the Hamas attacks on Israel of 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.More than 70,600 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Additional reporting by Tom McArthur",

    "body": "6 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandTabby WilsonA ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia has come into effect along the border, where almost three weeks of deadly clashes have forced nearly one million people from their homes.In a joint statement, the defence ministers of the two countries agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Once it has been in place for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand since July will be released, the statement said.The breakthrough came after days of talks between the two countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US.The agreement prioritises getting the displaced back to their homes, and also includes an agreement to remove landmines.Thailand's Defence Minister Natthaphon Narkphanit described the ceasefire as a test for the \"other party's sincerity\".\"Should the ceasefire fail to materialise or be violated, Thailand retains its legitimate right to self-defence under international law,\" he told reporters.UN human rights chief Volker Türk said he hopes the ceasefire will \"pave the way\" for peace, while an EU spokesperson urged \"good faith\" in its implementation.Thailand had been reluctant to accept the ceasefire, saying the last one was not properly implemented. They also resented what they saw as Cambodia's efforts to internationalise the conflict.Unlike the last ceasefire in July, US President Donald Trump was conspicuously absent from this one, although the US State Department was involved.That ceasefire agreement collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Si Sa Ket province, in which two Thai soldiers were injured.Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate.Clashes have continued throughout December. On Friday, Thailand carried out more air strikes inside Cambodia.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry said the strikes were \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses.How well the ceasefire holds this time depends to a large extent on political will. Nationalist sentiment has been inflamed in both countries.Cambodia, in particular, has lost many soldiers and a lot of its military equipment. It has been driven back from positions it held on the border, and suffered extensive damage from the Thai air strikes, grievances which could make a lasting peace harder to achieve.Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May, and two months later, in July, there were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.Following intervention by Malaysia and President Trump, a fragile ceasefire was negotiated between the two countries, and signed in late October.Trump dubbed the agreement the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\". It mandated both sides to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed region, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.However, the agreement was suspended by Thailand in November after Thai soldiers were injured by landmines, with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announcing that the security threat had \"not actually decreased\".",

    "body": "22 hours agoTom McArthurandAbdirahman Ali DhimbilGetty ImagesSomaliland's president Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi called the declaration \"historic\"Israel has become the first country to formally recognise Somalia's breakaway region of Somaliland as an independent nation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel intended to immediately expand cooperation in agriculture, health, and technology. Somaliland's president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, called the development \"a historic moment\".Recognition by Israel could encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing the region's diplomatic credentials and access to international markets.Somalia's prime minister, Hamza Abdi Barre, said his country categorically and unequivocally rejected what he called a deliberate attack by Israel on its sovereignty.Abdullahi said in a statement that Somaliland would join the Abraham Accords, in what he called a step toward regional and global peace.Somaliland was committed to building partnerships, boosting mutual prosperity and promoting stability across the Middle East and Africa, he added.The decision has been condemned by the foreign ministers of Somalia, Egypt, Turkey and Djibouti, who in a statement affirmed their \"total rejection\" of Israel's announcement.The two countries had agreed to establish \"full diplomatic ties, which will include the appointment of ambassadors and the opening of embassies\", Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said in a statement on X.\"I have instructed my ministry to act immediately to institutionalise ties between the two countries across a wide range of fields,\" he said.Meanwhile, Egypt's foreign minister held separate phone calls with his counterparts in Somalia, Turkey and Djibouti to discuss issues including Israel's declaration.In a statement, Egypt's foreign ministry said the four countries reaffirmed their support for Somalia's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and warned against unilateral steps that could undermine stability or create what they called \"parallel entities\" to Somalia's state institutions.They also argued that recognising the independence of parts of sovereign states would set a dangerous precedent under international law and the United Nations Charter. The statement added that the ministers reiterated their rejection of any plans to displace Palestinians outside their homeland.Israel has for years been trying to bolster relations with countries in the Middle East and Africa, but recent wars including in Gaza and against Iran have been seen as a hindrance to democracy.Historic deals struck late in Trump's first term in 2020, known as the Abraham Accords, saw several countries including Muslim-majority United Arab Emirates and Morocco normalise relations with Israel, with other countries joining later. Somaliland has a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden, and has its own money, passports and police force. Born in 1991 after a war of independence against former dictator General Siad Barre, it has grappled with decades of isolation ever since.With a population of almost six million, the self-proclaimed republic has recently been at the centre of several regional disputes involving Somalia, Ethiopia and Egypt.Last year, an agreement between landlocked Ethiopia and Somaliland to lease a stretch of coastline for a port and military base angered Somalia.",

    "description": "Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been jailed for 15 years for abuse of power and money laundering, in his second major trial for a mult",
    "body": "Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been jailed for 15 years for abuse of power and money laundering, in his second major trial for a multi-billion-dollar state funds scandal.Najib, 72, was accused of misappropriating nearly 2.3 billion Malaysian ringgit ($569m; £422m) from the nation's sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).On Friday afternoon a judge found him guilty in four charges of abuse of power and  21 charges of money laundering. The former PM is already in jail after he was convicted years ago in another case related to 1MDB.Friday's verdict comes after seven years of legal proceedings, which saw 76 witnesses called to the stand.The verdict, delivered in Malaysia's administrative capital Putrajaya, is the second blow in the same week to the embattled former leader, who has been imprisoned since 2022.He was handed four 15-year sentences on abuse of power charges, as well as five years each on 21 money laundering charges. The jail terms run concurrently under Malaysian law. On Monday, the court rejected his application to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. But the former prime minister retains a loyal base of supporters, who claim that he's a victim of unfair rulings and who have showed up at his trials calling for his release.On Friday, dozens of people gathered outside the court in Putrajaya in support of Najib.The 1MDB scandal made headlines across the world when it came to light a decade ago, embroiling prominent figures from Malaysia to Goldman Sachs and Hollywood.Investigators estimated that $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private pockets, including Najib's.Najib's lawyers claim that he had been misled by his advisers - in particular the financier Jho Low, who has maintained his innocence but remains at large.But the argument has not convinced Malaysia's courts, which previously found Najib guilty of embezzlement in 2020.That year, Najib was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust over 42 million ringgit ($10m; £7.7m) transferred from SRC International - a former unit of 1MDB - into his private accounts.He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but saw his jail term halved last year.The latest case concerns a larger sum of money, also tied to 1MDB, received by his personal bank account in 2013. Najib said he had believed the money was a donation from the late Saudi King Abdullah - a claim rejected by the judge on Friday.Separately Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, was sentenced to ten years in jail in 2022 for bribery. She is free on bail pending an appeal against her conviction.The scandal has had profound repercussions on Malaysian politics. In 2018 it led to a historic election loss for Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition, which had governed the country since its independence in 1957.Now, the recent verdicts has highlighted fissures in Malaysia's ruling coalition, which includes Najib's party United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).Najib's failed house arrest bid on Monday was met with disappointment from his allies but celebrated by his critics within the same coalition.Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim called for politicians on all sides to respect the court's decisions.Former Malaysian lawmaker Tony Pua told the BBC's Newsday programme that the verdict would \"send a message\" to the country's leaders, that \"you can get caught for corruption even if you're number one in the country like the prime minister\".But Cynthia Gabriel,  founding director of Malaysia's Center to Combat Corruption and Cronyism, argued that the country has made little headway in anti-corruption efforts despite the years of reckoning after the 1MDB scandal.Public institutions have not been strengthened enough to reassure Malaysians that \"the politicians they put into power would actually serve their interests\" instead of \"their own pockets\", she told Newsday.\"Grand corruption continues in different forms\", she added. \"We don't know at all if another 1MDB could occur, or may have already occurred.\"",

    "body": "55 minutes agoRachel Muller-HeyndykandAdam GoldsmithThe sound of gunfire and blasts can be heard overnight and into the morning in KyivAn intense Russian attack on Kyiv overnight shows Moscow \"doesn't want peace\", Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday as he prepared for a fresh round of peace talks. Zelensky made the comments en route to Florida, where he will meet US President Donald Trump on Sunday to discuss a new 20-point peace plan agreed by American and Ukrainian envoys.The 10-hour missile and drone barrage directed at Ukraine's capital killed two people and left 32 injured, local authorities said.Damage to energy infrastructure left 40 percent of residential buildings in Kyiv and nearby districts without heating, according to Ukraine's minister for development Oleksiy Kuleba.Russia's ministry of defence said long-range precision weapons were used to target energy facilities, which it claimed were being used \"in the interests of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex\".Writing on Telegram Zelensky said that Russia directed almost 500 drones and 40 missiles towards Kyiv, targeting energy and civilian infrastructure.Pictures showed gaping holes in apartment buildings and homes on fire following the strikes.The apartment block of BBC journalist Anastasiya Gribanova was struck, leaving some homes on the higher levels of the high-rise building in flames. Gribanova, who was in the building's elevator at the time, was unharmed.ReutersA house in Kyiv was also hit, Ukraine's emergency services saidUkraine's State Emergency Service said that 68 people were evacuated from a retirement home in the eastern Darnytskyi district.\"Russian representatives are having long conversations, but in reality the Daggers [missiles] and Shaheds [drones] are speaking for them,\" Zelensky wrote on Telegram, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want to end the war.\"This sick activity can only be responded to with really strong steps. America has this opportunity, Europe has this opportunity, many of our partners have this opportunity,\" he wrote, urging allies to show strength against Russian aggression.The attack saw Poland, which shares a 530km-long (320 miles) border with western Ukraine, ready its fighter jets, ground-based air defence systems and radar reconnaissance.Later on Saturday morning, it concluded that there had been no violation of the country's airspace.Russia's Defence Ministry said its air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed almost 200 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, including eight over Moscow.Zelensky briefly met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Saturday, ahead of his Florida meeting with Trump.Speaking in Nova Scotia, Zelensky said the latest bombardment of Kyiv was \"Russia's answer [to] our peace efforts and this really shows that Putin doesn't want peace\".Carney pledged $2.5 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine, but agreed that \"lasting peace\" would require \"a willing Russia\". Zelensky said he hoped for a \"constructive\" meeting with Trump on Sunday to discuss the 20-point plan.Security guarantees and territorial concessions for Ukraine are likely to return to the table, issue on which Russia has previously been unwilling to compromise.Also on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited a command and control overseeing Moscow's war, according to Russian news agency TASS. Wearing army fatigues, Putin said if Kyiv did not want to resolve the conflict peacefully, Russia would accomplish its objectives militarily, according to comments in state media. ReutersThe aftermath of the damage in KyivThe new 20-point draft is a revised version of an earlier 28-point plan which was drafted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, but widely seen as being too favourable to Russia.The Ukrainian president has voiced optimism around the new draft, describing it as \"a foundational document on ending the war\", but Trump warned that Zelensky \"doesn't have anything until I approve it\" in an interview with Politico.The draft reportedly includes security guarantees from the US, Nato and European allies for a co-ordinated military response if Russia were to invade Ukraine again.Control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas has been a sticking point in talks so far, but now Zelensky has said a \"free economic zone\" could be an option. Trump told Politico that he was expecting to see the new draft on Sunday.\"I think it's going to go good with him. I think it's going to go good with [Vladimir] Putin,\" Trump said in the interview, adding that he expects to speak with Russia's president \"soon\". ",

    "body": "2 days agoNikita Yadav AFP via Getty ImagesIndia gets plenty of sunlight throughout the year, which makes solar power highly efficientIndia's rapid solar energy expansion is widely hailed as a success. But without a plan to manage the waste it will generate, how clean is the transition?In just over a decade, India has become the world's third-largest solar producer, with renewables now central to its climate strategy. Solar panels are everywhere - from vast solar parks to blue rooftops across cities, towns and villages.Alongside large solar parks, millions of rooftop systems now feed power into the electricity grid. Government data show nearly 2.4 million households have adopted solar under a subsidy scheme.Solar growth has cut India's reliance on coal. Though thermal and other non-renewables still supply over half of installed capacity, solar now contributes more than 20%. Yet the achievement carries a challenge: while clean in use, solar panels can pose environmental risks if not properly managed.Solar panels are mostly recyclable, made of glass, aluminium, silver, and polymers - but trace toxic metals like lead and cadmium can pollute soil and water if mishandled.Solar panels typically last about 25 years, after which they are removed and discarded. India currently has no dedicated budget for solar-waste recycling and only a few small facilities to process old panels.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThermal power plants continue to dominate India's energy generation capacityIndia has no official data on solar waste, but a study estimated around 100,000 tonnes by 2023, rising to 600,000 tonnes by 2030. For now, the volume is small, but experts warn the bulk is yet to come - and without rapid recycling investment, India could face a growing waste crisis.A new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) estimates that India could generate more than 11 million tonnes of solar waste by 2047. Managing this would require almost 300 dedicated recycling facilities and an investment of $478 (£362m) over the next two decades.\"Most of India's large solar parks were built in the mid-2010s, so the real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,\" says Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray.India's solar-waste projections mirror global patterns: the US may generate 170,000–1 million tonnes and China nearly one million tonnes by 2030, following rapid solar expansion in the 2010s.The policy landscape, however, differs significantly.In the US, solar-panel recycling is mostly market-driven under a patchwork of state rules. China's system, like India's, is still developing and lacks a dedicated regulatory framework.In 2022, India brought solar panels under e-waste rules, making manufacturers responsible for collecting, storing, dismantling and recycling them at end of life.Experts say enforcement is uneven, especially for home and small-scale panels, which make up 5–10% of installations. Though modest, these panels can still generate substantial waste, as they are harder to track, collect, and recycle.Damaged or discarded panels often end up in landfills or with unauthorised recyclers, where unsafe methods can release toxic materials. The BBC has contacted India's renewable energy ministry for comment.Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesDamaged and ageing rooftop panels are rarely recycled\"Solar power gives an illusion of clean energy for two decades, but without a serious plan for recycling panels it risks leaving behind a graveyard of modules and not much of a legacy,\" says environment expert Sai Bhaskar Reddy Nakka.Despite the challenges, experts say the problem is not without opportunities.  \"As waste rises, so will the demand for companies that know how to process it,\" Mr Pahwa says. Efficient recycling could reclaim 38% of materials for new panels by 2047 and prevent 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions from mining, says CEEW.India already has markets for glass and aluminium, and metals found in solar cells - silicon, silver, and copper - can be recovered for new panels or other industries, says Akansha Tyagi, co-author of the study.Currently, most solar waste is processed with basic methods that recover only low-value materials like glass and aluminium, while precious metals are lost, damaged or extracted in tiny amounts.Experts say the next decade will be decisive for India's solar goals. The country must act fast - building a regulated, self-sustaining recycling system, raising household awareness, and integrating waste collection into solar business models.Companies that profit from solar power should also be responsible for what happens to panels once they stop working, says Mr Nakka. \"Without proper recycling, clean energy today could mean more waste tomorrow,\" he warned.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "2 days agoGrigor Atanesian & Investigations TeamBBC News Russiant.me/kotovayanoraA selfie taken by Alexander Butyagin earlier this year at an ancient site in CrimeaA Russian archaeologist detained in Poland is at the centre of an intense debate over the role of museums and experts and the role they play in Kremlin war propaganda.Alexander Butyagin is under arrest in Warsaw, awaiting a Polish court decision on a request to extradite him to Ukraine.Until now, courts across Europe have been reluctant to extradite Russians to Ukraine, citing the European Convention on Human Rights.Butyagin's case has divided opinion.A senior scholar at the Hermitage, Russia's largest art museum in St Petersburg, he has led the museum's expedition at the site of Myrmekion in Crimea since 1999, well before Russia's illegal landgrab of Ukraine's southern peninsula in 2014.Supporters argue his work has helped preserve Crimea's ancient heritage, but critics say he is no better than a looter of Ukrainian history making the most of Russia's occupation.Getty ImagesSite of Myrmekion in CrimeaMyrmekion dates back to the 6th Century BC, when the Ancient Greeks settled in Crimea as democracy was being born in Athens.Butyagin's expedition has uncovered hundreds of ancient coins at the site, some from Alexander the Great's period in the 4th Century BC.His expedition continued after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, and a criminal case was opened against him by Ukrainian authorities for working there without authorisation.In November 2024, he was placed on a wanted list, and in April 2025 a Kyiv court ordered his arrest in absentia. Butyagin is accused of illegal excavations and \"illegal partial destruction\" of an archaeological complex.Under the 2nd Protocol to the Hague Convention for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict, occupying authorities \"shall prohibit and prevent\" any archaeological excavations with only a few, narrow exceptions.Both Poland and Ukraine are parties to the protocol, while Russia is not.AFP via Getty ImagesHermitage director Mikhail Piotrovsky has endorsed Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine Excavations, however ethical, amount to destruction if they take place without permission and under conditions of armed conflict, says Evelina Kravchenko, a senior researcher at the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.Butyagin \"violated the Hague Convention, and all his problems stem from that\", says Kravchenko, whose committee issued permits for Russian archaeologists to work in Crimea before its annexation.Butyagin told Russian media last year he was \"simply doing the work we've devoted our lives to\", and that his main goal was preserving monuments.Getty ImagesThis ancient Roman sarcophagus from Myrmekion has been in the Hermitage collection since 1851The Hermitage press office insisted Butyagin's work complied with all international legal and ethical norms \"regardless of geopolitical circumstances.\"A senior archaeologist from the museum told the BBC that Butyagin had followed the only path available for Russian archaeologists working in Crimea.\"A Russian archaeologist, if he wants to continue his research, has no opportunity to obtain permits from the Ukrainian side, but must obtain them from the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation,\" said the scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to comment on the case.Several Ukrainian sources have also accused Butyagin of \"looting\" objects by taking them to Russia, although these charges are not part of Ukraine's case.Both the archaeologist and the Hermitage insist all their finds remain in Crimea as they are transferred to the Eastern Crimean Museum in Kerch. They argue that objects can only be relocated to Russia temporarily for restoration or as exhibition loans.However, this violates Ukrainian law too, as all discoveries must go into Ukraine's museum fund. Under the terms of Russia's illegal annexation, the Eastern Crimean Museum collection has instead been made part of Russia's museum fund.Since the start of the war, several European courts have refused Ukraine's requests to extradite Russians, citing potential risks under the European Convention, which prohibits politically motivated persecution, violations of the right to a fair trial, and torture and inhuman treatment of detainees.Even if the Polish court deciding Butyagin's case does find sufficient grounds to extradite him, it might not go ahead, says Gleb Bogush, a researcher at the Institute for International Peace and Security Law at the University of Cologne.Last June, Denmark's Supreme Court ruled against extraditing to Ukraine a Russian national suspected of espionage for Moscow.Gleb Bogush says it is primarily the Russian state and its officials that are responsible for Crimean excavations, rather than Butyagin, because it was not up to archaeologists to decide whether the Hermitage expedition should continue.A senior Hermitage employee told the BBC that \"a field archaeologist cannot be a citizen of the world; he deals with officials, obtaining permits and has to look for funding and volunteers\".Butyagin has attracted support not just from the Kremlin but from Russians who oppose Putin and the war.\"The claims being made against him are absurd,\" said Arseny Vesnin, an exiled journalist and historian. He said Butyagin had ensured conservation and preservation of the site he was excavating.Others maintain that artefacts would have been looted by criminals and sold on the black market if Russian archaeologists had refused to work in Crimea.That does not justify their actions, says Samuel Andrew Hardy, a leading British criminologist specialising in the protection of cultural property in conflict zones.Official excavations do not always stop criminal digs from taking place, he argues. Some looters target sites that have already been excavated.Hardy says all that Butyagin's supporters are doing is arguing that ultimately Russia should just be allowed to carry on doing what it wants regardless of the war.",

    "body": "20 hours agoAlex BoydGetty ImagesFive men have been arrested in Germany suspected of being involved in a plot to drive a vehicle into people at a Christmas market.Three Moroccans, an Egyptian and a Syrian were detained on Friday over the plan to target a market in the southern Bavarian state. Authorities said they suspected an \"Islamist motive\".Prosecutors said the Egyptian - a 56-year-old - was alleged to have \"called for a vehicle attack... with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible\". The Moroccans allegedly agreed to carry out the attack.Officials in Germany have been on high alert after previous attacks at Christmas markets, including in Magdeburg last December that killed six people.Authorities did not say when the planned attack was supposed to take place or which market was the target, though said they believed it to be one in the Dingolfing-Landau area, north east of Munich.German newspaper Bild reported the Egyptian man was an imam at a mosque in the area.Police said the Moroccan men - aged 30, 28 and 22 - were arrested accused of having agreed to commit murder, while the Syrian man, a 37-year-old, was accused of encouraging the suspects \"in their decision to commit the crime\".The five suspects appeared before a magistrate on Saturday and remain in custody.Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria's state interior minister, told Bild the \"excellent cooperation between our security services\" had helped to prevent \"a potentially Islamist-motivated attack\".Christmas markets are popular festive attractions throughout Germany, frequently attracting large crowds and significant tourism.Security at events has been increased in recent years, since an attack in Berlin in 2016 when a man drove a lorry into a market crowd, killing 12 people.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDearbail JordanAFP via Getty ImagesUS troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against ISTwo US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter have been killed in Syria in an ambush by an Islamic State (IS) gunman, the US Central Command (Centcom) has said.Officials said three other service members were injured in the attack, during which the gunman was \"engaged and killed\". Syria's state news said two Syrian service personnel were also injured.US President Donald Trump wrote on social media that it was \"an ISIS attack\" against the US and Syria and said there would be \"a very serious retaliation\". Syria's president sent condolences to Trump after the attack.On Sunday Trump said two of the injured American personnel have been released from hospital.The identities of those killed have yet to be released, with the military saying it is waiting until their next of kin have been informed.In a post on X, Centcom, which directs American military operations in Europe, Africa and the Indo-Pacific, said the attack was \"the result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman\", while a Pentagon official said initial assessments showed the attack was \"likely\" to be carried out by the Islamic State group.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security force.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.The ambush occurred in Palmyra, located in the centre of the country, while the soldiers were \"conducting a key leader engagement\", according to Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell.He added the attack is under investigation.A Pentagon official said: \"This attack took place in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"Trump added that the three injured US soldiers were \"doing well\".Getty ImagesUS and Syrian forces were ambushed in Palmyra in central SyriaUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said: \"Let it be known, if you target Americans - anywhere in the world you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"In a post on X, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said the country condemned the attack, and extended its condolences to the families of the victims. Tom Barrack, US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, said: \"I strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist ambush targeting a joint US–Syrian government patrol in central Syria.\"We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.\"Last month, President Ahmed al-Sharaa met with Donald Trump at the White House in a visit that the Syrian leader said was part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.Syria recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.The global coalition is aimed at eliminating the remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.In 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks. The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.",

    "body": "A person of interest has been detained in connection with a shooting at Brown University in the US which left two people dead, police said.Nine others were injured after a gunman opened fire at the university in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday.Police said the detained suspect was in his 20s, and he was later named by US media outlets as Benjamin Erickson.Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said seven people who were injured in the incident remained in a stable condition, one of them is in critical condition, and another was discharged.The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.The identities of those killed and most of the injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters on Saturday that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.In an email to staff on Sunday, the head of Durham Academy, a private school in North Carolina, said one of their alumna, Kendall Turner, was injured in the attack, US media reported. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Kendall, her family, and all members of the Brown University community during this incredibly difficult time,\" said Michael Ulku-Steiner.In a statement released by the university on Sunday, Paxson said some areas of campus were still restricted as police continued their investigations. Around 2,000 students were relocated to safe locations overnight, she said, adding that she was \"deeply moved\" by students and locals who opened up their homes.Paxson said the families of the two students killed were being supported. \"There are not enough words of comfort for families who lose a child, but we will do all we can,\" she added. In a news conference on Sunday, Smiley said an earlier order for residents to shelter had now been lifted. The mayor said he had met with victims and their families in the hospital and was \"overwhelmed\" by their \"courage, hope, and gratitude\".A vigil will be held on Sunday evening for the community. Police had earlier released CCTV footage of a male suspect walking away from the scene wearing all black clothing. Officers said a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building.In a post on X, FBI director Kash Patel said the suspect was detained at a hotel in Coventry, in the early hours of Sunday morning based on a lead from Providence Police.Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez confirmed on Sunday that officers were not looking for anyone else and were working with prosecutors to collect evidence.Hundreds of police officers and federal agents were sent to Providence on Saturday to find the suspect. Speaking at the White House, President Trump said he hoped the nine injured students \"get well fast\" and paid respects to the families of the two people who died. The attack on the Ivy League university brings the number of mass shootings to 389 in the US for this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.",

    "body": "From booze to black belts: Virginia's drunk raccoon suspected in karate shop break-inA raccoon that broke into a Virginia store and joyfully drank its way through the liquor aisle is now suspected of a wider crime spree, officials say.A Hanover animal control officer suspects the stripe-tailed mammal also broke into a nearby karate studio and then raided the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for snacks.\"Supposedly, this is the third break-in he's had,\" said Officer Samantha Martin.The raccoon, now nicknamed the \"trashed panda\", was first discovered passed out in the bathroom of the Ashland liquor store two days after Thanksgiving. After sobering up, the unlikely outlaw was released back into the wild.A new study found the masked mammals known for rummaging rubbish bins for easy food, are evolving and getting comfortable around humans.Ms Martin says it's only a matter of time before the masked bandit strikes the shopping centre again.\"This is not the first time he's been in one of the buildings,\" she told the county government's official podcast, Hear in Hanover, on Thursday. \"He was in the karate studio. I think he got into the DMV [and] ate some of their snacks one time,\" she said. She later added that there is a chance the earlier break-ins could have been perpetrated by a different raccoon - but officials have identified him as their prime suspect.Raccoons are known for breaking into peoples garbage cans, leading to the nickname \"trash panda\".The county has been selling shirts with the logo \"trashed panda\" and has raised a whopping $207,000 (£155,000) as of Friday. The money will be used to renovate the shelter, and add to its capacity, Ms Martin said. Officials say the little Kung Fu trash panda was living his best life when he was detained in the liquor store and kept his spirits up even after being placed in the county kennel. \"I just set him in there, [and] let him kinda relax for a few hours. The sun was beating on him so he was feeling good,\" Ms Martin said, adding that he was released about one mile away from the shopping complex. \"He didn't do anything wrong. He was just having a good time.\" The story has gone viral, which Ms Martin says is because it is so \"relatable\".\"Everybody's been there,\" she says. \"Everybody's had a few extra and passed out by the toilet, and hopes somebody can come get you the next morning.\"\"I hope he learned his lesson,\" she said, before adding that there's a good chance he might be found committing another heist soon. \"He'll be back. He's not a dummy.\" ",

    "body": "2 days agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandMatt SpiveyCambodia has shut its border crossings with Thailand, as fighting continues between the two forces on Saturday despite US President Donald Trump earlier saying they had agreed to a ceasefire.The crossings will be closed until further notice, according to Cambodia's interior ministry.Earlier, Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said he told Trump a ceasefire would only be possible after Cambodia had withdrawn all its forces and removed landmines.Thai officials said four soldiers were killed on Saturday, as both sides reported continued bombing and artillery exchanges. Cambodia has not been updating its military casualty figure.Cambodia's defence ministry said that Thai fighter jets bombed hotel buildings and a bridge, while Thailand reported several civilians were injured in a Cambodian rocket attack.The four deaths on Saturday bring Thailand's total military death toll since Monday to 15, with 270 others injured. It added that six civilians had also been injured.On Friday, Cambodia said at least 11 civilians had been killed and 59 others injured.At least 700,000 people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.Trump had claimed earlier in the week that he could stop the fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces that broke out on Monday just by picking up the phone.After speaking to both prime ministers on Friday night he wrote on social media that the two countries had agreed to \"cease shooting effective this evening\" and go back to the agreement they signed in front of the US president in October.\"Both countries are ready for peace,\" he wrote.But in their comments after speaking to the US president, neither side mentioned an imminent ceasefire.Anutin said he told Trump that Thailand was not the aggressor, and that Cambodia must show that it had withdrawn its forces and removed landmines from the border before a ceasefire was possible. \"They must show us first,\" he said.The Cambodian leadership said they must fight on to protect their country's sovereignty.There was no mention of the use of tariffs as leverage to force the two sides to disengage, as happened in July.Thailand has warned the US not to link the conflict to trade.On Saturday Cambodia reported that it had been struck by more Thai air strikes.\"On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs\" on a number of targets, the Cambodian defence ministry said in an X post.\"Thai military aircraft have not stopped bombing yet,\" it said.The Thai military also confirmed that fighting continued.The long-standing border dispute escalated on 24 July, as Cambodia launched a barrage of rockets into Thailand, which responded with air strikes.Both countries have accused each other of initiating the attacks. After days of intense fighting which left dozens dead, the neighbouring South East Asian countries agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This was formalised at a ceremony in Malaysia in October presided over by the US president.However, both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines, which have caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Cambodia says the mines are left over from the civil war in the 1980s.Since then, tensions continued to build.This week, Thailand launched air strikes inside Cambodia after two of its soldiers were injured in a skirmish last Sunday. Cambodia has responded with rocket barrages. The fighting affected six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and six provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.The two countries have been been contesting their 800km land border for more than a century. The border was drawn by French cartographers in 1907, when France was the colonial ruler in Cambodia.",

    "body": "2 days agoAndré Rhoden-PaulAFP via Getty ImagesIranian security forces have \"violently arrested\" Nobel Peace Prize winner and women's rights activist Narges Mohammadi, her foundation has said. The Narges Foundation said Ms Mohammadi, 53, was detained in the eastern city of Mashhad, along with other activists. The Nobel Committee said it was \"deeply concerned by today's brutal arrest of Narges Mohammadi\" and called on the authorities \"to immediately clarify Mohammadi's whereabouts, ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\". Iran does not appear to have commented.  Ms Mohammadi was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights. In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from jail for three weeks on medical grounds, after being held in Tehran's notorious Evin prison since 2021. She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences. Her latest arrest reportedly came as she attended a memorial ceremony for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer found dead in his office last week. Norway-based group Iran Human Rights had called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances around his death were \"suspicious\". Several other activists were detained at the ceremony, where it's reported they shouted slogans, including \"death to the dictator\" and \"long live Iran\". Taghi Rahmani, Ms Mohammadi's husband, told BBC Persian: \"They arrested Narges violently. The brother of the lawyer witnessed her arrest at the memorial.\"This act is against human rights laws, and amounts to some kind of revenge. \"This happened in Mashhad today and is concerning because the establishment's crackdown has intensified recently.\"Ms Mohammadi had recently accused the Iranian authorities of intensifying repression since the June ceasefire with Israel. Last week she wrote an article for Time magazine about the Iranian state controlling all aspects of personal or public life. \"Their peace is disrupted by surveillance, censorship, arbitrary arrest, torture, and the constant threat of violence,\" she said. She had also told the Nobel Committee she had received warnings from \"agents of the regime\" through indirect channels and her lawyers. \"The threats conveyed to Ms Mohammadi make it clear that her security is at stake, unless she commits to end all public engagement within Iran, as well as any international advocacy or media appearances in support of democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression,\" the Nobel committee's statement added.Over the past year, she has continued to remain defiant, refusing to wear the mandatory headscarf and meeting fellow activists across the country.Across her lifetime, Mohammadi has been arrested 13 times and been sentenced to more 36 years imprisonment and 154 lashes, according to her foundation.

    "body": "1 day agoJames Cook,JerusalemandRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, IstanbulIsrael said it killed a senior Hamas commander on Saturday in a strike on a vehicle inside Gaza.In a joint statement, the Israeli military and security agency Shin Bet announced it had \"eliminated\" Raed Saad, the head of weapons production for Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in Gaza city.Saad had been regarded as one of the most prominent Qassam commanders and led several brigades during Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israeli communities east of Gaza City. The Hamas-run Civil Defence spokesman, Mahmoud Basal, told the BBC that four people were killed in the strike. He said multiple passers-by were also injured by the blast.A local Hamas official in Gaza told the BBC that the strike also killed Saad's aide and another lower-ranking official identified as Abu Imad al-Laban.The BBC is prevented by Israel from reporting independently from inside Gaza and is unable to verify details of the incident. The IDF and ISA joint statement added that Saad had been \"responsible for the deaths of many soldiers\" killed in the Gaza Strip as the result of explosive devices.Saad is believed to be a member of the newly formed five-member leadership military council established since a ceasefire took hold in October. Israel has attempted to kill him on multiple occasions.One of the most notable attempts was during a surprise Israeli operation in Gaza City in March 2024, when Israeli forces reportedly sought to arrest or kill him. Sources at the time said Saad had been inside the targeted complex but managed to escape moments before the raid.He has long been considered one of Israel's most wanted Hamas figures, with Israeli attempts to kill him spanning more than two decades.Saturday's attack happened on the Palestinian-controlled side of the so-called Yellow Line which has divided Gaza since an unstable US-led ceasefire came into effect on 10 October.Israeli forces control the area to the east of the line, which includes just over half of the Gaza Strip.The first phase of US president Donald Trump's 20-point plan for peace in the region required the return of all 20 living and 28 dead hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.About 1,200 people were killed in the attack and more than 250 people were taken hostage.All have been returned except for the remains of an Israeli police officer, Ran Gvili, 24, who is believed to have been killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action.The diplomatic focus is now shifting to the next stage of President Trump's plan which would require the disarmament of Hamas as part of what it calls the de-radicalisation and redevelopment of Gaza.It envisages Gaza being run by the \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee,\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Trump.Security would be provided by an International Stabilisation Force although its make up remains unclear.The eventual aim is for a reformed Palestinian Authority to take control of the territory, and for Israeli forces to withdraw, after which \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\". Many aspects of the plan are controversial in Israel where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state.Trump is due to meet Netanyahu to discuss the plan in the US on 29 December.",

    "body": "A large fire broke out on a Turkish car ferry anchored at the Ukrainian port city of Odesa after it was hit in a strike on Friday.The company that operates the Cenk T confirmed the attack occurred at 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT) shortly after it docked at the Chornomorsk port.Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky has blamed the strike on Russia, which has not commented.The attack came hours after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Russian President Vladimir Putin that a limited ceasefire for energy facilities and ports could be beneficial. Russia has resisted all calls for a ceasefire.Moscow has threatened to cut \"Ukraine off from the sea\" in response to Kyiv's maritime drone attacks on Russia's \"shadow fleet\" tankers thought to be used to export oil - and a main source for funding the ongoing war.Cenk Denizcilik, the company that owns the cargo ship that operates on the Karasu-Odesa route across the Black Sea, said on Friday that it had been carrying \"essential food supplies\" when it was hit shortly after anchoring at the Ukrainian port city.Emergency response measures were immediately activated with the vessel's crew, port fire brigade and assisting tugboats after a fire broke out on the forward section of the ship, the company's statement added.\"At this stage, there are no reports of casualties or injuries among the crew,\" it said.Video footage of the attack's aftermath, which was shared on Zelensky's Telegram account, shows crews attempting to extinguish a large blaze on the vessel.  While condemning a series of missile attacks that Russia had carried out on the Odesa region the night before, the Ukrainian leader blamed Moscow for targeting the civilian Turkish ship, saying it \"could not have any military meaning\".Turkey's foreign ministry said an agreement should be reached that would guarantee \"the security of shipping and suspending attacks against energy and port infrastructure in order to prevent escalation in the Black Sea\". \"We once again underline the importance of urgently ending the war between Russia and Ukraine,\" the ministry said.Turkey has sought to maintain relations with the two warring countries since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. It also controls the Bosphorus Strait, which is a key passage for transporting Ukrainian grain and Russian oil out to the Mediterranean. Russia carried out a second round of strikes on Odesa later in the evening which damaged the port infrastructure facility, according to the region's head of administration.\"[This] emphasises the deliberate nature of enemy strikes on the civilian infrastructure of the region,\" Oleg Kiper wrote in a Telegram post.Friday's strikes knocked out electricity for thousands of homes in Odesa.This comes as US President Donald Trump appears to have grown frustrated by the slow progress his administration is making in securing a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia.Despite Washington's recent diplomatic push, Kyiv and Moscow have rejected key parts of the Trump administration's proposal.While Ukraine is adamant that there should be security guarantees from the US and Europe in place before agreeing to an end to the war, Russia is continuing to demand territorial concessions - which Kyiv has resisted.Russia has been making slow gains on the ground recently.But claims it is in control of key hubs, such as the key town of Pokrovsk - a strategic point on a big road and rail artery in the eastern  Donetsk region - are being denied by the Ukrainians.And in a show of defiance on Friday, President Zelensky posted a video of himself in  Kupyansk - which Moscow claimed to have captured last month.

    "body": "2 days agoVitaly ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringWarehouses supplying the vast majority of Ukraine's pharmacies have been destroyed in a series of Russian attacks over recent months.Medical supplies worth about $200m (£145m) were destroyed in just two strikes in December and October.A large warehouse storing medicines in the city of Dnipro was destroyed in a Russian air strike on 6 December. As a result, about $110m worth of medicines were destroyed - estimated at up to 30% of Ukraine's monthly supply.\"It was a missile and drone strike against our facility. The missiles flew past, but the drones hit it,\" said Dmytro Babenko, acting director-general of pharmaceutical distributor BADM.\"They caused a fire which unfortunately proved impossible to contain and the whole facility was destroyed.\"BADM is one of two companies that supply about 85% of Ukrainian pharmacies in roughly equal shares.The other company is Optima Pharm, whose warehouses have been hit three times this year - on 28 August, 25 October and 15 November.The October attack destroyed its main storage facility in Kyiv, and cost the company more than $100m, says Optima Pharm's chief financial officer Artem Suprun.Russia denies hitting civilian targets, but when the Optima Pharm warehouse was hit in October, the defence ministry in Moscow said only that it had targeted a factory producing drones.On the day BADM's warehouse was destroyed, Russia said it had hit \"a warehouse storing military equipment\" as well as energy and transport infrastructure.Such attacks significantly complicate the treatment of sick and wounded in Ukraine,   after almost four years of Russia's full-scale war.The International Rescue Committee (IRC), an NGO that had been using the warehouse in Dnipro, says it lost $195,000 worth of medication and supplies, which could have served 30,000 people in need.\"When I arrived at the site I was devastated, the scene was simply awful. All of this medicine could have served people for years, and in a single moment it was all lost,\" says the IRC's Andriy Moskalenko.The IRC said the Dnipro facility had served \"as a critical hub for hospitals, healthcare providers, pharmacies and humanitarian actors\".Mr Babenko from BADM said the Russian attack had destroyed \"vitally important medicines\" that had been imported and are not produced in Ukraine.\"It's a pretty complicated situation,\" he told the BBC.But he is hopeful that the attack will not leave Ukrainians without medicines.\"There won't be significant shortages, possibly only of certain types of goods. We're hoping to restore all supplies in a month or a month-and-a-half,\" Mr Babenko said.Ukrainian authorities accuse Russia of deliberately targeting hospitals, ambulances, medics and rescue workers, claims Moscow has denied. According to the government in Kyiv, more than 2,500 medical institutions have been damaged or destroyed, and more than 500 civilian doctors, nurses and other medical workers killed.Earlier this month, the World Health Organization said it had recorded 2,763 attacks on Ukraine's healthcare system since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, and it said that in 2025 there had been a 12% increase in attacks from the previous year.",

    "body": "1 day agoTom McArthurandIlma HasanWatch: Anger and chaos in Salt Lake stadium, Kolkata as Messi leaves event earlyAngry fans attending Lionel Messi's tour of India ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch after his appearance at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium.Thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to catch a glimpse of the football star, but were left disappointed when he emerged to walk around the pitch and was obscured by a large group of officials and celebrities.When the Argentina and Inter Miami forward was whisked away early by security after around 20 minutes, elements of the crowd turned hostile.West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.ReutersAs it became apparent Messi's appearance had ended, local media say the scene turned ugly Announcing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the incident at the stadium.\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" the chief minister said on X.A spokesperson for Messi said that he fulfilled the time commitment that had been agreed in advance. In terms of the organisation of the event itself, he referred the BBC to the apology issued by Banerjee on social media. A police official told reporters that the event's \"chief organiser\" had been arrested, without giving any further details, AFP reports.Authorities will look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets, the official added.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the \"private event\".Messi is in India for his 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour', a series of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi. His tour began with the unveiling of a 70ft (21m) statue of himself in Kolkata, which had been assembled over the course of 27 days by a 45-strong crew. Messi appeared virtually due to security concerns.Thousands of fans travelled to the city's stadium for a chance to see the footballer in person.They were chanting, buying jerseys and wearing \"I love Messi\" headbands.Messi initially walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended on Saturday, some frustrated fans stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, as others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.The 2022 World Cup winner - considered one of football's greatest ever players - had been expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium, the AFP news agency reports.\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi... Why did they call us then? We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face,\" a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.One angry fan told the Press Trust of India news agency people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\"I paid Rs 5,000 for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians,\" they said. \"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"Messi was accompanied on his brief visit by his Inter Miami teammate and Uruguay star Luis Suarez, and Argentina's Rodrigo de Paul.Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan also met Messi earlier in the day, according to the Reuters news agency.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesMessi waving to fans as he arrivedThousands of fans had gathered for the eventKolkata is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and has a large football fanbase in an otherwise cricket-crazed country.In the city, it is common to see hundreds of thousands of fans gather at stadiums at a derby of local clubs.In the early hours of Saturday, thousands lined the roads and congregated outside the hotel where Messi was staying to try and catch a glimpse of him.Hitesh, a 24-year-old corporate lawyer, flew nearly 1,900 kilometres from the south Indian city of Bengaluru.\"For me it's personal. You can see I am quite short, and I love to play football with my friends,\" Hitesh told the BBC, standing in front of the statue.\"Messi is the player I related with the most, no one can match his talent. He gives me hope that with talent you can do anything.\"",

    "body": "One million households without power in Ukraine after Russia attacks energy grid2 days agoAlex BoydState Emergency Service Of UkraineA firefighter works at the site of a Russian strike in OdesaMore than a million households are without electricity in Ukraine after a barrage of overnight Russian strikes hit energy and industrial infrastructure, officials said.Ukraine's internal affairs minister, Ihor Klymenko, said five regions were hit and at least five people were injured, and work was under way to extinguish fires and restore supplies.While Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have been common throughout the war, Moscow has intensified strikes as the country heads into winter.It comes as US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy will travel to Germany this weekend to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders for more talks on ending the war.Steve Witkoff, who has been leading White House attempts to mediate between Ukraine and Russia, will discuss the latest version of the proposed peace agreement in Berlin.On Saturday, Zelensky said more than 450 drones and 30 missiles were used by Russia in overnight strikes. Klymenko said the Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Chernihiv regions were hit.Russia's defence ministry said it used weapons including Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in the strikes - which are hard to track as they can change direction mid-flight.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all offsite power overnight \"due to widespread military activities affecting the electrical grid\", but is now reconnected. The plant is in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. It is not operating, but relies on a constant power supply to cool its reactors.In Russia, regional governor Roman Busargin said two people were killed in Saratov after a drone strike hit a residential building.The Trump administration is pushing for a deal to end the war to be in place by Christmas and has held several rounds of talks with Ukrainian and Russian representatives in recent weeks, though there has been little sign a breakthrough is imminent. It has not yet been confirmed which European leaders will attend the Berlin talks.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported details of the meeting, said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would all take part. The Witkoff-Zelensky meeting comes after Ukraine gave the US its revised version of a 20-point peace plan, the latest iteration of a proposal which first emerged in late November and has triggered a flurry of diplomatic activity.The fate of territory in eastern Ukraine remains one of the most intractable topics in the negotiations, with Kyiv refusing to cede land which has been illegally occupied, and Moscow repeating its intention to take the Donbas region in full by force unless Ukraine withdraws.Zelensky has reacted sceptically to the White House's latest proposal on resolving the territorial question, which is for Ukraine's army to pull out of the region and for it to be turned into a \"special economic zone\".The Ukrainian president told reporters that under the US-proposed terms, the Kremlin would undertake not to advance into the areas vacated by Ukraine's forces, with the land between Russian-controlled parts of the Donbas and Ukraine's defensive lines effectively turned into a demilitarised zone.\"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\" said Zelensky.In public, Ukraine and its allies in Europe have described the US-led talks as fruitful, and have hailed progress on securing amendments to a plan which was widely viewed as favouring Russia when it first emerged. But there have been signs in recent weeks that Trump is losing patience with Zelensky and his backers on the continent.In a scathing interview with Politico earlier this week, the US president labelled European leaders \"weak\" and renewed his calls for Ukraine to hold elections.Zelensky said elections could be held within 90 days if the US and Europe provided the necessary security. Elections have been suspended since martial law was declared when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.As the White House's diplomatic push continues, attention in Europe is focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. The Ukrainian government faces a stark financial situation: it needs to find an extra €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) over the next two years.On Friday, EU nations agreed to indefinitely freeze around €210bn (£185bn; $247) worth of Russian assets held in Europe. It is hoped the agreement paves the way for the funds to be loaned back to Ukraine if a deal can be reached at an EU summit next week, providing Kyiv with financial help for its military and efforts to rebuild parts of the country left devastated after nearly four years of all-out war.That move has been condemned as theft by the Kremlin, and Russia's central bank has said it will sue Euroclear, a Belgian bank where the vast majority of Russian assets frozen after the invasion are held.Officials are still negotiating the exact structure of a deal to repurpose the Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine, with the Belgian government particularly sceptical due to its legal exposure as the main holder. Elsewhere, it was reported that the latest version of the peace plan being circulated envisions Ukraine rapidly joining the European Union.The Financial Times said Brussels backed Ukraine's swift accession to the bloc, an idea proposed by Ukraine in the latest draft it has given to Washington.Ukraine formally applied to join the EU days after the 2022 invasion, but despite promises of an accelerated process is still several years away from becoming a member.Under the plan, Ukraine would become a member as soon as January 2027, AFP reported, citing an unnamed senior official. It was unclear whether Washington had approved that element of the draft.",

    "body": "What we know so far about the Brown University shooting3 hours agoTom McArthurWatch: Police release CCTV of Brown University shooting suspectPolice have detained a person of interest in connection with a US shooting at Brown University that left two people dead and nine others injured. An earlier order for people on the Brown campus and surrounding areas to shelter in place has also been lifted.The attack on the campus brings the number of mass shootings in the US to 389 for this year, according to the independent analysis website Gun Violence Archive.It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.Here's what we know:What happened?The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Barus and Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.Final exams were taking place in the building at the time of the shooting, the school said.The engineering building is a seven-storey block that includes 117 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and three lecture halls.An economics professor told local public media outlet Ocean State Radio that the shooting had taken place during a review session for her course, which was led by her teaching assistant.\"He said that the shooter came in the doors, yelled something - he couldn't remember what he yelled - and started shooting,\" Rachel Friedberg said.\"Students started to scramble to try to get away from the shooter, trying to get lower down in the stadium seating, and people got shot,\" she added.On Saturday, investigators said they were not immediately sure how the suspect got inside the first-floor classroom. Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Mayor of Providence Brett Smiley said.Two students, who were studying in the nearby Rockefeller library when the active gunman alert came through, told the BBC they \"stayed away from the windows\" as they awaited a police escort.Officers searched the floor, made them drop their bags and raise their hands before before being led out of the library, the pair said.Brown University, one of the oldest higher education institutions in the US, is part of the Ivy League, a group of elite universities in the northeast of the country.The university, which has more than 11,000 students, is in Providence, Rhode Island's capital city, which is located about 50 miles (80km) from Boston and 180 miles (290km) from New York City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesWho are the victims?Two students were killed in the incident and nine others were injured. Smiley told reporters on Sunday that one person is in a critical condition and seven others are in a stable condition in hospital. One person with less severe injuries was discharged, he added. The identities of those killed or most of those injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters in a press briefing that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.\"This is a day that we hoped never would come to our community. It is deeply devastating for all of us,\" she said in a statement.In a statement on Sunday, the university said that the families of the two students killed were being supported.\"There are not enough words of comfort for families who lose a child, but we will do all we can,\" Prof Paxson said.On Sunday, the head of Durham Academy, a private school in North Carolina, said one of their alumna, Kendall Turner, was injured in the attack, US media reported.\"Our thoughts and prayers are with Kendall, her family, and all members of the Brown University community during this incredibly difficult time,\" said Michael Ulku-Steiner in an email to staff. According to police, a ninth victim did not suffer a gunshot wound, but had non-life threatening injuries from fragments from a shooting \"that had occurred near them\".Who is the gunman?A person of interest was taken into custody in connection with the shooting, officials said on Sunday.Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said limited details would be released on the detained suspect, but said he was in his 20s. He was later named by US media outlets as Benjamin Erickson.In a post on X, FBI director Kash Patel said the suspect was detained at a hotel in Coventry in the early hours of Sunday morning based on a lead from Providence Police.A law enforcement source told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the person of interest is not currently enrolled as a student at Brown University.Officials confirmed on Sunday that officers were not looking for anyone else.On Saturday police released CCTV footage of a male suspect, walking away from the scene of the shooting wearing all black clothing.There is no weapon visible in the video, and his face is covered. Officials also say a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building on Saturday.Some witnesses reportedly told officers he may have been wearing a camouflage grey mask.One person was arrested before police determined they were not involved in the shooting and released them.What is the latest?In a statement released by the university on Sunday, Prof Paxson said some areas of campus are still restricted as police continue their investigations.She said around 2,000 students were relocated to safe locations overnight, adding that she was \"deeply moved\" by students and locals who opened up their homes. Brown University said all remaining exams, papers and projects would not take place as scheduled. US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters as he returned to the White House from attending the annual Army and Navy football game, described the shooting as \"a terrible thing\".\"All we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt,\" he said.Additional reporting by Pratiksha Ghildial",

    "body": "An eyebrow tip and McDonald's footage: Takeaways from Luigi Mangione's evidence hearing 2 days agoMadeline Halpertin court, New YorkGetty ImagesMr Mangione has watched as the court plays body camera footage from the day of his arrestLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a case that sparked national attention, watched as new testimony and never-before-seen footage from the day of his arrest in a McDonald's was unveiled during a hearing this week.Mr Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges related to the 2024 murder of Mr Thompson, a father of two, as well as federal counts that carry the possibility of the death penalty.The pre-trial hearing is focused on the defence's attempts to keep certain evidence out of the trial, which has not been scheduled yet, including items found in his backpack during his arrest and statements he made to officers.During the first two weeks of the hearing, supporters of Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family and Ivy League graduate - filled the back rows of the Manhattan criminal courtroom, some wearing a pin portraying him as a saint-like figure.Prosecutors and Mr Mangione's legal team are expected to question over a dozen witnesses from the day of his arrest, including the employees who spotted him and the police who arrested him.Here is a look at some of the key pieces of evidence discussed that offer a window into Mr Mangione's trial.An eyebrow giveawayThe pre-trial hearing has centred on the small-town McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where officers were shocked to find the high-profile suspect days after Mr Thompson was fatally shot - and hours from the busy Midtown Manhattan crime scene.Witnesses suggested the arrest may never have occurred there if not for one of  Mr Mangione's key features: his eyebrows.During the first day of the hearing, prosecutors played a call to police from a McDonald's employee about a tip from a customer in the restaurant.The employee said the customer thought a patron looked like the suspect in the United Healthcare CEO shooting. The patron was well covered, wearing a black hoodie, a medical mask and a tan beanie. But one key detail stuck out.\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".New York County District Attorney's OfficeProsecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"'Preposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald'sDozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.A fake name leads to an arrestWatch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald'sIn the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.Bullets, a journal and cash: a peek into Mr Mangione's backpackThe pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.New York County District Attorney's OfficeEvidence found during Mr Mangione's arrestVideo played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.The hearing is expected to continue into next week.",

    "body": "10 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, Vilnius, Lithuania'It's like coming up from the depth of the ocean', Ales Bialiatski tells BBCRumours of a major prisoner release from Belarus had been swirling for a couple of days.But no one would reveal the names on the list, or the exact number, until everyone was safely out, finally free.In total,123 political prisoners have been released, including some of the best-known names among Belarusian opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists.Maria Kolesnikova, the protest leader with a famous red-lipsticked smile, was on the release list.A video of her jumping for joy and hugging other former prisoners, overjoyed to be reunited, was soon flying around social media. Then came another, on a bus out of Belarus, where she thanked everyone who'd helped bring this moment about.\"It's a feeling of incredible happiness to see those who are dear to me, to hug them and realise we are all free,\" Masha, as she's best known, told the camera, her lips already painted red again.The first sunset of her freedom was a thing of great beauty, she said.\"But I also think of those who are not yet free and I await the moment when we can all embrace, when all are free.\"ReutersMaria Kolesnikova (centre) was among more than 100 prisoners handed over to UkraineOut too is Viktor Babaryka, a banker who tried to run for president in 2020 but was locked up before the elections even began.The Nobel Peace prize winner Ales Bialiatski has also been released from a 10-year sentence.All were imprisoned for their opposition to the authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko, whose security forces crushed the mass protests of 2020 with brutal force. They were the biggest challenge to his rule that he has ever faced. The prisoners' release now is the result of long and complex negotiations led by the US that culminated in a two-day visit to Minsk this week by Donald Trump's new special envoy, John Coale.For Lukashenko, that engagement itself is a win: after years as a political pariah in the West he is clearly happy to be back on talking terms with the US.But he also got US sanctions dropped on a key export for his country, potash, as a further, more tangible reward. EU penalties - and tougher policies - are still in place.It's not entirely clear what Trump has to gain from this. But Belarus is a close ally of Russia, including in its war on Ukraine, and the move comes as the US has been re-engaging with Moscow too, seeking a peace deal.Watch: BBC captures celebrations as Belarus frees political prisonersThe dozens of prisoners Lukashenko agreed to let go were always expected to come here to Vilnius, Lithuania, where a crowd of friends, relatives and fellow activists gathered outside the US embassy in the freezing cold to greet them.Some came wrapped in the red and white opposition flag of Belarus.Tatsiana Khomich, Masha Kolesnikova's sister who had campaigned for over five years for her release, couldn't stop smiling. \"I've just spoken to Masha,\" she told me after a video call.A professional flautist before the disputed 2020 elections, Kolesnikova spent much of her sentence in solitary confinement, denied even letters and phone calls to her family.\"She's fine, she's good. I just want to hug her. I still can't quite believe it,\" her sister said.Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd: a police car, blue lights flashing, was heading towards the US embassy gates, leading a small convoy of other vehicles.But there was no way all 123 ex-prisoners were inside. Instead, we learned, just seven foreign nationals had been brought to Lithuania and only Ales Bialiatski of the Belarusians.'Optimism and activism'The others, including Kolesnikova, had been taken out of Belarus to Ukraine: from prison, into a war zone.Staying in their own country is not usually an option on offer.\"Lukashenko's idea, who else?\" was how one of opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's team interpreted the surprise diversion to Ukraine. It seems he'd decided to play one final power game, so the family reunions, so long awaited, would be delayed.But what of the price paid for that moment? Tikhanovskaya is a friend and political ally of Masha Kolesnikova, but she always calls for maximum pressure on Lukashenko by the West.So has the US gone too far, I wondered.\"This is a process of negotiation. Of course, it would be good for us if nothing is given to Lukashenko, because all those people are hostages of his regime. They are innocent.\"But this is how negotiation goes,\" she replied, before noting that sanctions can always be reapplied if necessary.\"President Trump now uses carrots. He also can use sticks.\"A few steps away, a man waving a giant flag worried that Lukashenko would just take more prisoners. This is not a sign of sudden humanity, he said.After a short time inside the US embassy, Ales Bialiatski emerged onto the street to ecstatic cheers from the crowd.Gaunt, head shaven and still in his padded blue prison jacket, he admitted his head was spinning from all the sensations after four years in jail.\"I was driven across Belarus in a blindfold, from east to west, so I still can't get my head round it. This is so emotional,\" he shared, describing being woken at 04:00 and told by his prison guard to pack.When I asked what he wanted now most of all he didn't hesitate: \"I want to see my wife!\"She's on her way, I was told.Bialiatski's own organisation, Viasna, monitors political detentions in Belarus and the activist reminded everyone that many hundreds of people like him - only less well known - have been left behind bars.\"It is very important for everyone to continue to work for those political prisoners who are still in Belarusian prisons, to strive for the complete release of all of them.\"Then, lifting the red and white flag from his shoulders, he had a message for Belarusians everywhere.\"Optimism and activism,\" Ales Bialiatski told them, with a sudden smile. \"Never give up!\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoFan WangCostfoto/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA Su-35 fighter jet - the model Australia says was used by the PLA in Sunday's encounter - seen at the 2024 Zhuhai Air Show in ChinaAustralia has accused a Chinese military aircraft of releasing flares \"in close proximity\" to its patrol jet over the South China Sea.The Australian government has raised its concern with Beijing over the \"unsafe and unprofessional\" manoeuvre, the defence department said in a statement on Monday.There was no damage to Australia's P-8A aircraft and its personnel were unharmed after Sunday's encounter.A Chinese military spokesperson said the Australian jet \"illegally intruded\" into China's airspace and had to be expelled. The Australian aircraft's actions \"seriously infringed upon China's sovereignty\", Senior Colonel Li Jianjian, spokesperson for China's Southern Theater Command Air Force said, urging Canberra to \"immediately cease its infringing and provocative actions\".Australia Defence Force said it expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a safe and professional manner.This is the latest in a string of encounters between the two countries' militaries in the region, where China's vast claims over islands and outcrops overlap with those of its neighbours.Sunday's incident also occurred as Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was heading to the US for a meeting with President Donald Trump, where the two leaders are expected to discuss the Aukus - a multi-billion dollar submarine deal between Australia, the US and the UK. Australia has also accused a Chinese jet of dropping flares near an Australian plane in the area in February. China at that time said the Australian jet had intentionally intruded into its airspace and that its response was \"lawful and restrained\".While it has no claims to the South China Sea, Australia has aligned itself close to the US and its allies in saying that China's assertions have no legal basis.In May last year, Australia accused a Chinese fighter plane of dropping flares close to an Australian navy helicopter that was part of a UN Security Council mission on the Yellow Sea off the Korean coastline.In November 2023, Canberra accused Beijing's navy of using sonar pulses in international waters off Japan, which resulted in injuries to Australian divers.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJohn SudworthKyiv andMaia DaviesUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would be ready to join Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin at a proposed summit in Hungary if he were invited.The US and Russian presidents announced on Thursday they planned to hold talks on the war in Ukraine in Budapest, possibly in the coming weeks.In comments released on Monday, Zelensky told reporters: \"If it is an invitation in a format where we meet as three or, as it's called, shuttle diplomacy… then in one format or another, we will agree.\"Meanwhile, media reports have suggested his White House meeting with Trump on Friday descended into a \"shouting match\" - with the US side urging Ukraine to accept Russia's terms to end the war.Zelensky was guarded during his first press briefing since the talks, but still his comments made clear there were large areas of disagreement between the two sides.He described the meeting as frank, and said he had told Trump that his main aim was a just peace, not a quick peace.He criticised Hungary as the location of the prospective Trump-Putin talks, saying the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban could not do \"anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution\".When asked by reporters on Friday if Zelensky would be involved in the meeting in Budapest, Trump said he wanted to \"make it comfortable for everybody\".\"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated,\" he said, adding the three leaders \"have to get together\".Zelensky had hoped to secure US Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russia at the talks, but appeared to walk away empty-handed as Trump struck a non-committal tone on the matter.On Monday, media reports suggested the atmosphere at the US and Ukrainian leaders' meeting had been far more acrimonious than previously understood.The Financial Times reported Trump warned Zelensky that Putin would \"destroy\" Ukraine if he did not agree to its terms, citing sources familiar.The US side was said to have echoed Russian talking points at the \"volatile\" meeting. It also reported that Trump tossed aside maps of the frontline in Ukraine and insisted Zelensky surrender the entire Donbas region to Putin.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Just last month, Trump appeared to take a major shift in his position on ending the war by saying Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\".He said his position had changed \"after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation\".Trump had previously warned the process would likely involve Ukraine giving up some territory - an outcome Zelensky has consistently rejected.The US president has been pressuring Nato nations, as well as China and India, to stop purchasing Russian oil in a bid to create further economic pressure on Moscow to end the conflict.He also previously threatened Russia with tougher sanctions if Putin did not meet deadlines to make progress in ending the war, though he did not follow through with those threats.Trump's public relations with Zelensky had also vastly improved in recent months, most notably from an Oval Office meeting in February when he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president on live television.During his re-election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to office.",

    "body": "Bolivia elects centrist Rodrigo Paz, ending decades of socialist rule4 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, São PauloEPA/ShutterstockRodrigo Paz campaigned on a promise to bring \"capitalism for all\" to BoliviaBolivia has elected a centrist senator, Rodrigo Paz, as its next president, bringing an end to nearly 20 years of continuous rule by the Movement for Socialism (Mas) party.With almost all votes counted, Paz, of the Christian Democratic Party, defeated right-wing candidate Jorge \"Tuto\" Quiroga in Sunday's run-off election with a share of 54.6%.A severe economic crisis and infighting within Mas, which has dominated Bolivian politics since 2006, saw many voters wanting change.Paz has said he will end fuel shortages and address Bolivia's wider economic problems. In his victory speech, he said he would open up Bolivia to wider international investment and stimulate private-sector growth.Paz, 58, went from being a surprise frontrunner in the first round of the election in August to achieving a clear win over Tuto Quiroga, who received 45.4% of the votes in the run-off. The candidate for Mas did not make it into the run-off.Paz is perceived as relatively moderate and centrist compared to his opponent, making him more attractive to undecided and disillusioned left-leaning voters, who wanted change but did not want to cast their vote for Quiroga.Quiroga has conceded defeat and has called his rival to congratulate him. Paz's supporters took to the streets of La Paz, the country's administrative capital, to celebrate the result. One of them told AFP news agency \"we came to celebrate the victory with great hope of a new direction for Bolivia\".EPA/ShutterstockConservative former president Jorge Quiroga had hoped to win the election this time but was beaten by PazBolivia is grappling with severe shortages of fuel leading to long queues at petrol stations, a shortage of US dollars, and soaring inflation. Natural gas exports, which were once a major source of revenue for Bolivia, have also plummeted.Paz campaigned with the slogan \"capitalism for all\", promising free-market reforms and a commitment to help the poorest in society with social programmes.He has pledged to ease access to credit for small businesses, lower certain taxes, reduce import tariffs, crack down on corruption, and decentralise the government.He has also been clear that once in power, he plans to cut fuel subsidies, which he says are unsustainable. The subsidies have kept fuel prices relatively low but - because they mean that fuel is being sold at prices below import costs - have also lead to shortages and huge queues at pumps.EPA/ShutterstockMany indigenous Bolivians traditionally supported the Mas party, but its candidate did not make it into the run-offBolivia has been relatively isolated on the world stage in recent years but Paz's election victory could signal a thawing of relations between Bolivia and the United States, which have not had a formal diplomatic relationship since 2008.Relations between the two countries have been strained since 2008 when Bolivia's then-president Evo Morales expelled the US ambassador and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for allegedly conspiring against his government. The US has repeatedly accused Bolivia, one of the world's top producers of cocaine, of not meeting its anti-narcotics obligations, and has long criticised its recognition of Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro, whose last election was widely condemned internationally as being neither free nor fair.Reacting to Paz's election win, the US State Department said it looked forward \"to partnering with President-elect @Rodrigo_PazP to restore economic stability, expand private-sector growth, and strengthen security\". Once he takes office, Paz may make the calculation that distancing the country from allies including Venezuela and Cuba could help rebuild relations with US.Regarding China, an important trade partner for Bolivia which is the source of many imports and a key destination for Bolivia's minerals and lithium exports, Paz will likely try to secure new foreign investment and exports.ReutersFormer President Evo Morales was banned from running for office again - he has already been president three timesPaz's choice of running mate is thought to have helped him attract working-class voters and Bolivian's frustrated with government corruption. A former police captain, vice president-elect Edman Lara is known for his humble upbringings and whistleblowing on police corruption. He also a strong social media following.In the months leading up to the vote, Mas's popularity had been undermined by bitter divisions between two of its best known figures: the former president, Evo Morales, and the outgoing president, Luis Arce. Morales, who governed from 2006-2019, was disqualified from running in this election due to a ruling that limits presidents to two terms in office. As Morales has served a total of three terms as president - one before the constitutional two-term limit came into force - he was not able to stand again for the top job.Accused of statutory rape and fathering a child with a teenager - allegations he denies and says are politically motivated - he has been living in his stronghold of Chapare, where he is protected by his loyal supporters who have at times staged protests and roadblocks around the country leading to clashes. As voting is mandatory in Bolivia, he urged his supporters to spoil their votes rather than cast a ballot paper for either of the two candidates in the run-off. For many Bolivians, this election result reflects a desire for change and renewal. But Paz inherits tough economic circumstances and a bitterly divided country.Restoring economic credibility and uniting a country polarised into many factions after years of political turmoil will not be an easy task.Paz will take office on 8 November 2025.More on the Bolivian election",

    "body": "6 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe 4.8% growth in the third quarter marked a slowdown from 5.2% in the three months to JulyChina's economic growth slowed in the three months to the end of September as problems in the property market persisted and trade tensions with the US flared up.The world's second-largest economy grew by 4.8% compared to the same period in 2024, its weakest pace in a year, official figures released on Monday show.The data comes after China imposed sweeping controls on its exports of rare earths - minerals essential for the global production of electronics - a move that rocked its fragile trade truce with the US.The third-quarter growth figures will set the tone for a gathering of China's top leaders this week to discuss the country's economic blueprint over the next five years.The latest growth figure marked a slowdown from the annual rate of 5.2% seen in the three months to July.China's National Bureau of Statistics said the economy showed \"strong resilience and vitality\" against pressure . It credited momentum in its technology sector and business services as key growth drivers.Beijing has set a goal of \"around 5%\" economic growth this year and has so far avoided a sharp downturn, helped by government support measures and what - until recently - had been a trade ceasefire with Washington.When China announced controls on rare earths earlier this month, US President Donald Trump responded swiftly by threatening an additional 100% tariffs on imports from China.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he expects to meet Chinese officials this week in Malaysia in an attempt to ease tensions and set up a meeting between Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping.Before the recent flare-up, Chinese businesses had taken advantage of the trade truce with Washington to ship goods to the US, resulting in China's exports rising by 8.4% in September. The total value of imports to China was also up.China's industrial output grew by 6.5% last month from a year earlier, with its 3D-printing, robotics and electric vehicles manufacturers among its strongest performers.Its service sector, which includes IT support, consultancies, and transport and logistics companies, also grew.Getty ImagesChina has been struggling with a property crisis since 2021The latest data shows that China's exports have helped to offset its \"sluggish\" domestic spending, according to Sheana Yue, senior economist at Oxford Economics.Beijing has spent billions on incentives such as subsidies, higher wages and discounts to encourage locals to spend more and lift its economy.However, Ms Yue said it was unlikely China's economic growth this year would exceed 4.8% without further government support, which could come with the new Five-Year Plan laying out Beijing's economic goals.China's property sector also continued to struggle as real estate investment fell 13.9% in the year up to September.The housing market is going through a sharp downturn, marked by falling home prices, shrinking sales and instances of developers abandoning their projects.The real estate sector accounts for about a third of the Chinese economy and has been a major source of income for local governments.Home prices have fallen in almost every major city despite government support measures, said economics lecturer Laura Wu from Nanyang Technological University.In the long-run, housing \"is still the major drag on China's economic growth\" even as it faces uncertainty from Washington's tariffs and other trade barriers, said Prof Wu.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKoh EweSingapore andJake KwonSeoulA South Korean court has sentenced a teacher to life in prison for fatally stabbing an eight-year-old girl, in a case that shocked the nation.Myeong Jae-wan, 48, killed Kim Hae-neul, after luring her into a classroom in the central city of Daejeon in February.Prosecutors had sought the death penalty for Myeong, saying that the victim's family had asked for a harsh punishment.But the court said that while \"the risk of reoffending is high, it is difficult to conclude\" that Myeong must be executed.Myeong said that she would reflect on her mistakes for the rest of her life. She said her judgement had weakened at the time of the stabbing as she was receiving mental health treatment.Prosecutors said Myeong showed no remorse while the case was being investigated. However, Myeong submitted dozens of letters to the court expressing remorse.Myeong had previously requested a six-month leave of absence, citing depression, but returned to school in 20 days, after a doctor assessed her as being fit to work, the Daejeon education office said in February.She had displayed violent behaviour in the days before the stabbing, including putting another teacher in a headlock, the education office said.On the morning of the stabbing, two education officials had visited the school to investigate that earlier altercation.Myeong told police that she had bought a weapon on the day of the attack and brought it to school, planning to kill herself along with a random child.She also told the police that she had lured Kim into the media room before attacking her.Kim, the student, student was reported missing after a bus driver informed the school that she had not arrived to be picked up that day. She was found in school later that day with stab wounds, along with Myeong.Myeong also had a wound on her neck, which police said might have been self-inflicted. It was stitched up later in hospital.South Korea's leaders at the time called for safety measures to ensure such incidents never happen again.Myeong has also been ordered to wear an electronic location tracking device for 30 years.\"As an elementary school teacher, the accused was in a position to protect the victim,\" said the court's verdict on Monday. \"But she committed this brutal crime in which a child was not protected where they should be most safe.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoMartin YipHong Kong andStuart LauWatch: Wreckage of cargo plane seen at Hong Kong International AirportTwo Hong Kong airport security staff were killed when a cargo plane skidded off a runway, hit their patrol vehicle and ploughed into the sea.Emirates flight EK9788 was arriving from Dubai at about 03:50 local time (19:50 GMT) when it veered off the runway, crashed through perimeter fencing and collided with the security vehicle, pushing it into the water.The two people inside died. The Boeing 747 ended up partly submerged, but the four crew on board survived. Officials are investigating the cause of the crash on the north runway. Two other runways remain operational. It's one of the deadliest aviation incidents in years at Hong Kong International Airport, which has a good safety record.The investigation will focus on the unanswered questions over the path taken by the plane upon landing.Airport officials have said they gave the correct instructions to the plane and that there are signs on the runway to guide aircraft.Airport operations executive director Steven Yiu said the patrol car was, at the time, travelling on a road outside of the runway's fencing \"at a safe distance from the runway\". The plane then turned away from the runway, crashed through the fencing and collided with the vehicle, pushing it into the sea, Mr Yiu explained.\"Normally the plane is not supposed to turn towards the sea,\" he said at a news conference hours after the incident, adding that the plane did not send out a distress signal when it was landing.He stressed that the airport patrol car \"definitely did not run out onto the runway\".The weather, runway conditions, the aircraft and its crew will all be looked at as part of the investigation, Mr Yiu said.Divers managed to locate the bodies of the patrol vehicle’s driver and passenger in the sea.The two dead ground staff were aged 30 and 41 and had seven and 12 years' experience respectively, officials said. Neither was breathing when recovered from their vehicle, which was five metres (16.4 feet) from the shore, and seven metres under water. The younger of the two was confirmed dead at the scene, and the other later in hospital.  Hong Kong's transport bureau has said it was \"saddened\" by their deaths and expressed condolences to their families.In a statement to the BBC, an Emirates spokesperson said the plane \"sustained damage on landing in Hong Kong\", adding: \"Crew are confirmed to be safe and there was no cargo onboard.\"It also said the Boeing 747-481 cargo aircraft was wet leased from, and operated by, Turkish carrier Act Airlines. A wet lease is an arrangement where one airline provides the aircraft, crew and insurance to another airline.The four crew members onboard the plane had opened the emergency doors of the aircraft shortly after the crash. They were spotted by fire service staff who arrived at the scene within two minutes, and were rescued, authorities said.Pictures show the plane had broken in half, with part of the fuselage submerged in the water with large cracks clearly visible. At least one emergency evacuation slide deployed successfully.ReutersPart of the plane's fuselage is lying in the water off the runwayA police official told the media that criminal investigations would not be ruled out.An official from the Hong Kong Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) said they were still trying to locate the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - also known as the black boxes - from the sea.The affected runway would remain closed for the rest of the day, but the airport's other two runways are still in operation.At least 11 cargo flights initially scheduled to arrive at Hong Kong International Airport on Monday have been cancelled, according to the Airport Authority's website.It marks the second ever deadly incident at the airport since it moved from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok in July 1998. In August 1999, a China Airlines passenger flight crash landed during a typhoon, killing three people.",

    "body": "7 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterWatch: Bangladesh's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport engulfed in flamesBusiness leaders in Bangladesh fear losses of more than $1bn (£750m) after a devastating fire broke out in the logistics section of the country's main airport on Saturday.Clothes and raw materials were among the goods destroyed, which could put some businesses at risk, according to the country's export associations.The cause of the fire - which took 27 hours to extinguish -  is still being investigated. The blaze had forced the temporary suspension of flights and airport operations.Bangladesh is the word's second-largest exporter of clothes after China, supplying global retailers like H&M and Walmart.Bangladesh's garment sector generates around $40bn a year, accounting for over a tenth of its gross domestic product. Local media reports say around 35 people were injured while working to contain the blaze.The damaged airport cargo village is among the country's busiest logistics hubs, especially during the pre-Christmas rush. The centre stored fabrics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and other goods.Some of the goods destroyed were \"essential\" samples for securing new buyers, which means affected businesses could lose out on future opportunities, Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufactuers and Exporters Association, told reporters yesterday.In an email to the BBC, the International Air Express Association of Bangladesh also estimated damages of more than $1bn.Getty ImagesThe centre where the fire broke out stored fabrics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and other goodsThe garments association has asked all its members to submit a list of damaged goods to determine the full extent of the losses.Saturday's blaze was Bangladesh's third major fire within a week.On Tuesday, a deadly warehouse fire killed at least 16 people and injured many others. And on Thursday, another fire burned down a seven-story clothing factory in Chittagong.While investigations into Saturday's airport fire are still underway, conspiracy theories have been circulating online, linking it to the two earlier incidents and claiming all three were \"pre-planned\".In the past, the causes of such major incidents had been used by political parties to attack one another, with parties accusing opponents of exploiting the tragedies for political gain. Experts say the heightened speculation this time stems from a history of uninvestigated accusations, where no one was ever held accountable.The interim government of Bangladesh issued a statement on Saturday, saying it would take immediate and firm actions if \"any credible evidence of sabotage or arson is found\".Large fires are frequent in densely-populated Bangladesh. These are often blamed on poor infrastructure and weak safety enforcement. Hundreds of people have been killed in fires in recent years.Additional reporting by BBC Bangla.",

    "body": "Former Kenyan prime minister and revered long-time opposition leader Raila Odinga was buried in the west of the country after a service attended by thousands on Sunday.\"Now finally Baba is home,\" his son, Raila Odinga junior, said beside his father's casket, draped in the Kenyan flag.The burial concluded days of memorials that at times led to chaos, with at least five mourners dying at other events and dozens injured at a public viewing on Saturday.Odinga died on Wednesday aged 80 in an Indian hospital.He became prime minister after the bloody and disputed 2007 election, and was the main opposition leader for many years, losing five presidential campaigns, most recently three years ago.He retains a devotional following in the west of the country. Former US President Barack Obama, whose Kenyan family hails from the same region, called Odinga a \"true champion of democracy\". Politicians, relatives and throngs of his supporters waved Kenyan flags and held his picture aloft as they gathered at Sunday's memorial service, which was held at a university in Bondo.\"Even in the grave, he still remains our hero,\" one mourner told the AFP news agency.Obituary: A founding father of Kenya's multi-party democracyHow Odinga's court challenges have improved Kenya's electionsMilitary personnel carried Odinga's coffin to the front, where a choir sang and speakers, including Kenyan President William Ruto, remembered him.\"His courage, his vision, and his unyielding faith in our collective destiny will forever illuminate the path of our nation,\" Ruto said in a post on Facebook about the event.\"His return to Bondo was not merely a homecoming; it was the embrace of a grateful Republic bidding farewell to one of its greatest sons, a patriot who devoted his life to the cause of justice, democracy, and the enduring unity of our beloved Kenya.\"Odinga was buried nearby at his late father's homestead, where there is a family mausoleum.Multiple memorial events had already taken place, including a state funeral in Nairobi on Friday and a public viewing in a stadium in his home city of Kisumu on Saturday.At the viewing, tens of thousands filed past his open coffin, many crying out the phrase \"we are orphans\".At least three people were killed when police opened fire to disperse mourners, with dozens more injured in the chaotic scenes that followed.

    "body": "Chen Ning Yang, Nobel laureate and one of the world's most influential physicists, has died at the age of 103, according to Chinese state media.An obituary released by CCTV cited illness as the cause of death.Yang and fellow theoretical physicist, Lee Tsung-Dao, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their work in parity laws, which led to important discoveries regarding elementary particles - the building blocks of matter. Yang was also a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and an honorary dean of the Institute for Advanced Study at the institution.Born in 1922 in China's eastern Anhui province, he was the oldest of five children and raised on the campus of Tsinghua University where his father was a professor of mathematics.As a teenager, Yang told his parents: \"One day, I want to win the Nobel Prize.\"He achieved that dream at the age of 35, when his work with Lee studying the law of parity earned them the honour in 1957.The Nobel committee praised \"their penetrating investigation... which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\".Yang received his science degree in 1942 from National Southwest Associated University in Kunming, and later completed a master's degree at Tsinghua University.At the end of the Sino-Japanese War, he travelled to the US on a fellowship from Tsinghua and studied at the University of Chicago, where he worked under Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, inventor of the world's first nuclear reactor.Throughout a prolific career, he worked across all areas of physics, but maintained particular interest in the fields of statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.Yang received the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in 1957 and was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Princeton University in 1958.Yang married his first wife Chih Li Tu in 1950, with whom he had three children.After Tu's death in 2003, Yang married his second wife Weng Fan, who is more than 50 years his junior.The pair had first met in 1995 when Weng was a student in a physics seminar, and later reconnected in 2004. At the time, Yang called her his \"final blessing from God\".",

    "body": "The Spanish town of Terrassa in north-eastern Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters to prevent potentially sinister \"rituals\" during Halloween.All requests for the fostering or adoption of the felines will be denied from 6 October to 10 November to protect them from being hurt or used as props, said the local animal welfare service. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque told broadcaster RTVE that adoption requests for black cats usually increase around Halloween.While black cats are often associated with witchcraft and seen as bad luck in Western culture, many other cultures, including Japan and Egypt, see them as symbols of prosperity and fortune.Terassa's city council said there had been no record of cruelty towards black cats in the town, however there have been incidents in other areas and the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups.\"We try to prevent people from adopting because it's trendy or impulsively. And in cases like these, which we know exist, to prevent any macabre practices,\" Duque said.Terrassa is home to more than 9,800 cats, according to local authorities, and the town's adoption centre houses around 100 felines, 12 of which are black, the Catalan News Agency reported.The city council emphasised that the measure is \"temporary and exceptional\" and represents an extra precaution for animal welfare, but did not rule out repeating the ban in the future.Exceptions during the ban period will be assessed individually by the adoption centre and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentThe Myanmar military says it has captured one of the most notorious scam compounds on the border with Thailand, as it reclaims key territory it lost in the ongoing civil war.KK Park, south of the border town of Myawaddy, has been synonymous with online fraud, money laundering and human trafficking for the past five years. Thousands of people were lured to the compound with the promise of well-paid jobs, and then forced to run elaborate scams, stealing billions of dollars from victims all over the world.The military, long tainted by its links to the scam business, now says it has taken the complex as it expands control around Myawaddy, the main trade link to Thailand. In recent weeks the military, or junta, has pushed back insurgents in several parts of Myanmar, aiming to maximise the number of places where it can hold a planned election, starting in December.  It still doesn't control large swathes of the country, which has been torn apart by conflict since a military coup in February 2021. The election has been dismissed as a sham by opposition forces who have vowed to block it in areas they hold.KK Park began with a lease agreement in early 2020 to build an industrial park between the Karen National Union (KNU), the ethnic insurgent group which controls much of this region, and a little-known Hong Kong listed company, Huanya International. Researchers believe there are links between Huanya and a prominent Chinese underworld figure Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth, who has since invested in other scam centres on the border. The complex expanded rapidly, and is easily visible from the Thai side of the border. Those who managed to escape from it describe a brutal regime imposed on the thousands of people, many from African countries, who were held there, forced to work long hours, with torture and beatings inflicted on those who failed to meet targets.A statement by the junta's information ministry said its forces had \"cleared\" KK Park, releasing more than 2,000 workers there and confiscating 30 of Elon Musk's Starlink satellite terminals – widely used by scam centres on the Thai-Myanmar border for online activities. The statement blamed what it called the \"terrorist\" Karen National Union and volunteer people's defence forces, which have been fighting the junta since the coup, for illegally occupying the area.The junta's claim to have shut down this infamous scam centre is almost certainly directed at its main patron, China. Beijing has been pressing the junta and the Thai government to do more to end the illegal businesses run by Chinese syndicates on their border. Earlier this year thousands of Chinese workers were taken out of scam compounds and flown on chartered planes back to China, after Thailand cut access to power and fuel supplies.But KK Park is only one of at least 30 similar compounds located on the border. Most of these are under the protection of Karen militia groups allied to the junta, and most are still operating, with tens of thousands of people running scams inside them. In fact, the support of these militia groups has been crucial in helping the military drive back the KNU and other resistance groups from territory they captured over the past two years.The military now controls nearly all of the road linking Myawaddy to the rest of Myanmar, a goal the junta set itself before it holds the first stage of the election in December. It has taken Lay Kay Kaw, a new town established for the KNU with Japanese funding in 2015, a time when there had been hopes for lasting peace in Karen State following a national ceasefire.That is a more significant blow to the KNU than the takeover of KK Park, from which it did get some revenue, but where most of the financial benefits went to pro-junta militias. A well-placed source has told the BBC that scam work is continuing in KK Park, and that it is likely the military took control of only part of the sprawling complex. The source also believes Beijing is giving the Myanmar military lists of Chinese individuals it wants taken from the scam compounds, and sent back to face trial in China, which may explain why KK Park was attacked.",

    "body": "1 day agoIan AikmanBBCA large crowd gathered for the players' funeral on SaturdayAfghanistan has pulled out of an upcoming cricket series after three players in a local tournament were killed in an air strike it blamed Pakistan for.The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said it would withdraw from November's tri-nation T20 series out of respect for the dead. The three did not play for the national team.The strike hit a home in Urgon district in Paktika province, where the players were eating dinner after a match, witnesses and local officials told the BBC.Eight people were killed, the ACB said. Pakistan said the strike hit militants and denied targeting civilians. The ACB named the three players who were killed as Kabeer Agha, Sibghatullah and Haroon, calling their deaths \"a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family\".The International Cricket Council (ICC) said it was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" by the \"tragic deaths of three young and promising Afghan cricketers\" in an air strike that also \"claimed the lives of several civilians\".\"The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief,\" it said in a statement, adding that it \"strongly condemns this act of violence\".The attack came hours after a temporary truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan was due to expire following days of deadly clashes on the border between the two nations. Dozens of casualties have been reported.Pakistan said it had targeted Afghan militants in the air strike and that at least 70 combatants had been killed. Pakistan's Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar said claims that the attack targeted civilians are \"false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan\".He rejected the ICC's \"selective, biased and premature comment\", adding it had not cited any \"independent verification to substantiate these claims\". Afghanistan Cricket Board/XThe Afghanistan Cricket Board shared this image of the three players who were killedIn a social media post, Afghan national team captain Rashid Khan paid tribute to the \"aspiring young cricketers who dreamed of representing their nation on the world stage\".Other players for the Afghan national side joined the tributes, including Fazalhaq Farooqi, who said the attack was a \"heinous, unforgivable crime\".On Saturday, large crowds of people were seen gathering at the funeral for the strike's victims.The strike came after Pakistani officials said seven soldiers were killed in a suicide attack near the Afghan border on Friday.The 48-hour truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which began on Wednesday at 13:00 GMT, has reportedly been extended to allow for negotiations.An Afghan delegation arrived in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday for peace talks with the Pakistani side. The Taliban government said it would take part in the talks despite \"Pakistani aggression\", which it says was Islamabad's attempt to prolong the conflict.Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Pakistan should \"reconsider its policies, and pursue friendly and civilised relations\" with Afghanistan.Pakistan's Foreign Office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif would lead the country's delegation in Doha.It said the talks will focus on ending cross-border terrorism and restoring peace and stability on the Pakistan-Afghan border.Zimbabwe will now replace Afghanistan in the T20 series.",

    "body": "2 days agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAfter serving 43 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Subramanyam \"Subu\" Vedam was finally free. New evidence had exonerated him earlier this month of the murder of his former roommate.But before he could reach his family's arms, Mr Vedam was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who want to deport him to India - a country he has not lived in since he was a baby.Now, Mr Vedam's legal team is fighting a deportation order and his family is determined to get him out of custody, for good.His family are now working to navigate a new and \"very different\" situation, his sister Saraswathi Vedam told the BBC. Her brother has gone from a facility where he knew inmates and guards alike, where he mentored fellow inmates, and where he had his own cell, to a facility where he shares a room with 60 men and where his history of good behaviour and mentorship is unknown.Mr Vedam has been repeating one message to his sister and other family members in the wake of the new situation: \"I want us to focus on the win.\"\"My name has been cleared, I'm no longer a prisoner, I'm a detainee.\"The 1980 murderMore than 40 years ago, Mr Vedam was convicted of murdering his once-roommate Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student. Kinser's body was found nine months after he went missing in a wooded area with a bullet wound in his skull. On the day of Kinser's disappearance, Mr Vedam had asked him for a ride. While the vehicle Kinser drove was returned to its usual spot, no one saw it being returned. Mr Vedam was charged with Kinser's murder. He was denied bail, had his passport and green card seized by authorities and was labelled a \"foreigner likely to flee\".Two years later he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offence, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence. Throughout that time, Mr Vedam maintained his innocence on the murder charges. His supporters and family members stressed there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. Getty ImagesMr Vedam's exoneration Mr Vedam repeatedly appealed the murder conviction and a few years ago new evidence in the case surfaced which exonerated him. Earlier this month, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna said he would not pursue a new trial against Mr Vedam.But Mr Vedam's family knew there was one hurdle left before he was free: he still had a 1988 deportation order, based on his convictions for murder and a drug offence. The family expected they would have to file a motion to have his immigration case reopened, Ms Vedam said. The facts of the case are different now, she stressed.But when they arrested him, ICE cited the immigration order as their reasoning for quickly detaining him in a different Pennsylvania facility. While he was exonerated for the murder charge, his drug conviction still stands, they have said. The immigration agency said it acted on a lawfully issued order.ICE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but told other US outlets that Mr Vedam will remain in custody pending his deportation. Mr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.\"What was deeply disappointing was that we didn't even have a moment to hold him in our arms,\" Ms Vedam said. \"He was held wrongly and one would think that he conducted himself with such honour and purpose and integrity that that should mean something.\"Potential deportation to IndiaThe family has stressed Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best. While he was born there, he moved to the US at nine months old. What relatives are still alive, are distant ones, Ms Vedam told the BBC.His community - Ms Vedam, her four daughters and other cousins - are in the US and Canada. \"He will again be robbed and miss out on the lives of the people closet to him, by being half way across the world,\" she said. \"It's almost like having his life stolen twice.\"Mr Vedam, who is a legal permanent resident, had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested. Both of his parents were also both US citizens.\"We believe deportation from the United States now, to send him to a country where he has few connections, would represent another terrible wrong done to a man who has already endured a record-setting injustice,\" his lawyer, Ava Benach said in a statement to the BBC.",

    "body": "22 hours agoRachel HaganEPAThe Taliban has accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital KabulPakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government have agreed to an \"immediate ceasefire\" after more than a week of deadly fighting.The foreign ministry of Qatar, which mediated talks alongside Turkey, said both sides had agreed to establish \"mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability\".Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said ending \"hostile actions\" was \"important\", while Pakistan's foreign minister called the agreement the \"first step in the right direction\".Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy casualties during the clashes, the worst fighting since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.Islamabad has long accused the Taliban of harbouring armed groups which carry out attacks in Pakistan, which it denies. Clashes intensified along the 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border that the two countries share after the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital Kabul.Rumours had circulated that the blasts in Kabul were a targeted attack on Noor Wali Mehsud, the leader of Pakistan's Taliban. In response, the group released an unverified voice note from Mehsud saying he was still alive.In the days that followed, Afghan troops fired on Pakistani border posts, prompting Pakistan to respond with mortar fire and drone strikes.At least 17 Afghan civilians have been killed and hundreds more wounded, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said on Thursday.A temporary truce was declared on Wednesday night as delegations met in Doha, but cross-border strikes continued.On Friday, the Taliban said Pakistan had carried out an air strike which killed eight, including three local cricket players.Under the new agreement, the Taliban said it would not \"support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan\", while both sides agreed to refrain from targeting each other's security forces, civilians or critical infrastructure.Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said the latest ceasefire meant \"terrorism from Afghanistan on Pakistan's soil will be stopped immediately\", with the two sides set to meet in Istanbul for further talks next week. Pakistan was a major backer of the Taliban after its ouster in 2001 following a US-led invasion. But relations deteriorated after Islamabad accused the group of providing a safe haven to the Pakistan Taliban, which has launched an armed insurgence against government forces.The group has carried out at least 600 attacks on Pakistani forces over the past year, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.",

    "body": "2 days agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemGaza's Hamas-run civil defence says 11 people were killed, all from the same family, after the bus they were in was hit by an Israeli tank shell in northern Gaza.The Abu Shaaban family, it said, were trying to reach their home to inspect it when the incident happened in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday night.This is the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire eight days ago.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.Israeli soldiers continue to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency the victims were killed while \"trying to check on their home\" in the area.The dead included women and children, according to the civil defence.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle.It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.\"Hamas said the family had been targeted without justification.The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control. With limited internet access, many Palestinians do not know the position of Israeli troops as the yellow demarcation line is not physically marked, and it is unclear if the area where the bus was travelling did cross it.The BBC has asked the IDF for coordinates of the incident.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday the army would set up visual signs to indicate the location of the line.In a separate development, Hamas on Friday released the body of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit to the Red Cross, which returned it to Israel.Mr Margalit was the tenth deceased hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people are yet to be repatriated. Israel handed the bodies of 15 more Palestinians over to officials in Gaza via the Red Cross, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the dead hostages' bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

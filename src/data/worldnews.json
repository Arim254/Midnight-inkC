    "body": "Parts of Australia will face catastrophic fire conditions on Friday, when heatwaves are expected to hit most of the country.Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days.The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at \"catastrophic\" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed.One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most \"significant\" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires.On Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported.Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C.In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days. Friday will be the \"real peak of the current burst of heat,\" Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC.\"It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania\".Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said.\"Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow,\" Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria.\"This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020,\" Hines said.That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and tens of millions of hectares of land was burnt. In Victoria, authorities on Thursday warned that a catastrophic fire danger rating means potential blazes can be \"unpredictable and uncontrollable\".\"We need the community to play their role alongside our emergency services to protect lives and property,\" said Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch.\"Prepare now and enact your bushfire survival plan. If you are in an area of forecast catastrophic fire danger, leave early to an area with a lower fire risk.\"Australia's fire danger ratings scale has four levels, with catastrophic being the highest level, followed by extreme, high and moderate.A heatwave is declared when the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to be unusually high for three days of more.",

    "body": "A British man living in Western Australia is set to be deported over claims that he was part of a well-known neo-Nazi group.Ryan Turner's visa was cancelled on character grounds and he was taken into immigration detention on Tuesday. He can appeal the decision to cancel his visa or voluntarily return to the UK.Turner is understood to be a member of the National Socialist Network, the same group that organised an anti-Jewish rally outside the New South Wales parliament last year. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"Our government has zero tolerance for bigotry and hate. If you don't like Australia, you can leave.\"The BBC has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment.Last year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute.In recent months, police have been cracking down on the use of these symbols amid fears of rising antisemitism and right wing extremism. Several foreign nationals with links to Nazi ideology have had their visas revoked including South African man Matthew Gruter who was detained last November.Gruter was also a part of the National Socialist Network and took part in the neo-Nazi rally outside the New South Wales parliament. It is unclear if Turner attended.Gruter was pictured in the front row of the rally along with about 60 other men, all clad in black, with a banner saying \"abolish the Jewish lobby\".Attendees also reportedly chanted \"blood and honour\", a slogan associated with the Hitler Youth, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Gruter, who had lived in Australia since 2022 and worked as a civil engineer, returned to South Africa with his wife and young child, the ABC reported in early December. In another case, a British man living in Queensland was arrested and charged for allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community.Just before Christmas, the man who was identified in court documents as Kayn Adam Charles Wells, was placed in immigration detention in Brisbane after his visa was cancelled. He faced court earlier this week - where he is understood to have requested voluntary removal from Australia - with the case adjourned until February. Last month, days after two gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event at Bondi Beach, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a crackdown on hate speech with new laws to target \"those who spread hate, division and radicalisation\".The reforms also aim to give the home affairs minister new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate.",

    "body": "6 hours agoChris GrahamandRachel HaganRussian drone strikes on Ukraine have left more than one million people in the region of Dnipropetrovsk without heating and water supplies, Ukraine's deputy prime minister says. Oleksiy Kuleba added that work was continuing to restore services following the large-scale attack, which damaged infrastructure across the south-east. Electricity supplies were also disrupted for thousands more people in neighbouring Zaporizhzhia, but power has since been restored. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, aimed at paralysing power supplies during a harsh winter. President Volodymyr Zelensky accused it of \"mockery\" and pleaded for Western support. Hospitals, water facilities and other critical services in Dnipropetrovsk were operating on backup systems, the energy ministry said, while residents were urged to limit electricity use to avoid further strain on the grid.DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive told the BBC last month, with most of Ukraine suffering from lengthy power cuts during winter.Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, which provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, said the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and his company had found it difficult to cope.\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions,\" Zelensky said. He urged Ukrainians to remain \"resilient\" against Russia's attempts \"to break Ukraine\" and added that peace talks aimed at ending the war should not be a reason to slow down Western supplies for Ukraine's air defences.Zelensky has been on a diplomatic tour this week - meeting allies in the \"Coalition of the Willing\" and US President Donald Trump's peace envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Following those talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached - a move Moscow warned would make foreign forces a \"legitimate target\".But a day later, Zelensky said European allies had not given him sound guarantees that they would protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression.However, he also said he believed Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine could be brought to an end in the first half of 2026. Speaking at the opening of Cyprus's presidency of the EU for the next six months, he said negotiations with European partners and the US had entered a new stage and stressed that the EU should play a central role in any settlement.President Donald Trump has been leading efforts to bring the war to an end. His proposals - amended by Ukraine and its European allies - envisage Ukrainian territorial concessions to Russia in areas it does not already control in the country's east.Negotiations centre on those points - the last 10% of the deal, according to Zelensky. So far, Ukraine has refused to agree to cede territory to Russia.Once agreed, those proposals would need Russia's approval.Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of backing down for his demands to annex the entire territory of the industrial eastern region of Donbas.His troops have been making slow progress in the past few months.",

    "body": "51 minutes agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , BeirutThe Lebanese army says it has taken over security in the south of the country, which for decades had been dominated by the Iranian-backed movement Hezbollah, amid fears that Israel could escalate its military offensive against the group.Lebanon has been under intense international pressure, particularly from the US, to disarm Hezbollah, a powerful militia and political party, since a ceasefire deal in November 2024 ended a devastating year-long war between Israel and Hezbollah.The army had set a year-end deadline to clear the area south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel, of non-state weapons in the first phase of a government-backed plan.The army said its objective had been achieved in an \"effective and tangible way\" but that there was more work to be done to clear unexploded ordnance and tunnels.Responding to the Lebanese army's statement, the office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said efforts toward fully disarming Hezbollah were \"an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah's efforts to rearm and rebuild its terror infrastructure with Iranian support\".In recent months, Lebanese soldiers have dismantled infrastructure in areas once controlled by Hezbollah in the south without facing resistance from the group, which says it has complied with the ceasefire deal and removed its fighters from those areas, where Palestinian factions including Hamas had also operated.But US and Israeli officials have expressed frustration with the pace of the army's efforts. Israel has accused Hezbollah - which is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and the UK - of trying to recover its military capabilities, including in the south. In recent days, Israeli media reported that Netanyahu had been given a green light by US President Donald Trump to intensify its military campaign against Hezbollah.Despite the ceasefire, Israel has carried out near-daily attacks on targets it says are linked to Hezbollah and continues to occupy at least five positions in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese government rejects the Israeli claims, and says Israel's actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and an obstacle to the army's efforts.Israel has not made the evidence it says it has about Hezbollah's activities public, and the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as Unifil, says it has seen no indication that the group is rebuilding its infrastructure in the areas where it operates.Lebanese officials say the next stage of the army's plan will focus on the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which includes the port city of Sidon. There is no timeline for that, and the cash-strapped Lebanese army has also complained of insufficient funding and equipment.Meanwhile, it is unclear if Hezbollah will resist the measures in other areas as it says it will not disarm north of the Litani. The group also has a strong presence in the eastern Bekaa valley and in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as the Dahieh. Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has rejected the use of force against the group, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to violence.Hezbollah - which is also a political party with representation in parliament and in the government, and a social movement that runs hospitals and schools - still enjoys significant support among Lebanon's Shia community. Opponents, however, see this as a unique opportunity to disarm the group, after its losses in the war. Hezbollah, so far, has rejected calls from the authorities to discuss the future of its weapons.In Lebanon's south, tens of thousands of residents remain displaced and communities lie in ruins, as Lebanon's international partners have conditioned funds for reconstruction on measures that include action against Hezbollah.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDavid GrittenReutersPolice patrol Aden, from where the Saudi-led coalition said Aidarous al-Zubaidi had fled by boatThe Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has alleged the United Arab Emirates helped smuggle a separatist leader out of the country after he was expelled from Yemen's presidential council and accused of treason.A coalition spokesman said Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), fled Aden on Tuesday night in a boat to Somaliland. He was then flown by a cargo aircraft to Abu Dhabi via Mogadishu under the supervision of UAE officers, he added.There was no immediate comment from the UAE or STC.The STC insisted Zubaidi was still working from Aden on Wednesday, after the coalition said he had failed to fly to Riyadh for talks and had fled to an unknown location.The coalition also accused Zubaidi of moving STC forces from bases in Aden to his home province of al-Dahle and said it had carried out air strikes on them in response.The STC said the strikes, which reportedly killed four people, were \"unjustified\" and \"inconsistent\" with calls for dialogue with Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is overseen by the presidential council and backed by Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been allies in the war against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement over the past decade, but the infighting between the rival factions they support has deepened a rift between them and pushed southern Yemen to the brink of a new conflict.On Thursday, coalition spokesman Maj Gen Turki al-Malki said it had \"reliable intelligence\" showing Zubaidi and his associates fled from Aden's port in the early hours of Wednesday on board a St Kitts and Nevis-flagged passenger ship.The vessel sailed across the Gulf of Aden to Berbera in the breakaway region of Somaliland, where a Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft was waiting, he added.Malki said Zubaidi and his associates \"boarded the aircraft under the supervision of UAE officers\" and flew first to Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, before heading towards the Arabian Sea \"without a declared destination\".\"The aircraft disabled its identification systems over the Gulf of Oman, reactivating them only 10 minutes prior to landing at Al-Reef Military Air Base in Abu Dhabi,\" he added, without saying directly whether Zubaidi was still on board.ReutersThe Southern Transitional Council had said on Wednesday that Zubaidi was still in Aden (file photo)STC-aligned forces have in recent years taken control of much of southern Yemen, which they want once again to be an independent state, by pushing out forces loyal to the government.However, Saudi Arabia warned last week that the advances near the kingdom's borders constituted threats to its national security as well as the security and stability of Yemen.It also accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" its separatist allies to push into eastern Yemen and expressed support for a demand from the presidential council for all Emirati forces to leave.At the same time, the Saudi-led coalition - which was formed in 2015 by Arab states, including the UAE, after Houthi rebels seized control of north-western Yemen - struck what it said was a shipment of weapons and military vehicles for the STC that had arrived from the UAE.The UAE expressed \"deep regret\" at the Saudi accusations and denied there were any weapons, but agreed to pull its remaining forces out of the country.Since then, forces loyal to the government have retaken control of Hadramawt and al-Mahra with the help of coalition air strikes.Witnesses and government officials told Reuters news agency on Thursday that Aden was also now coming under the control of Saudi-backed forces.",

    "body": "16 minutes agoDanny Aeberhard,Rachel HaganandMatt McGrath,environment correspondentUS President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from dozens of international organisations, including many that work to combat climate change.Nearly half of the 66 affected bodies are UN-related, including the Framework Convention on Climate Change - a treaty that underpins all international efforts to combat global warming.Groups working on development, gender equality and conflict - areas the Trump administration had repeatedly dismissed as advancing \"globalist\" or \"woke\" agendas  - are also included. The White House said the decision was taken because those entities \"no longer serve American interests\" and promote \"ineffective or hostile agendas\".The memorandum was signed on Wednesday following a review, with the White House describing the organisations as \"a waste of taxpayer dollars\".\"These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities,\" it said in a statement.It added that many of the organisations promoted \"radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength\".As well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the US has also withdrawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on climate science that pulls together the most respected reports on the science of rising global temperatures.Sources within the organisation told the BBC that they were concerned about the potential impact of the Trump administration's withdrawal on US scientists involved in producing the body's next set of studies.The White House has already blocked US scientists attending a meeting in China.Any restrictions on travel or the participation of US researchers could significantly delay the release of the next set of IPCC reports, including potentially its mitigation report - a key document guiding governments on how to tackle climate change.Non-UN organisations affected by the US withdrawal include those focused on clean energy co-operation, democratic governance and international security, such as the International Solar Alliance, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. Trump has already stripped many multilateral organisations he dislikes of funds and previously rejected the scientific consensus of man-made climate change as a \"hoax\".It will take a year for the US to be able to fully withdraw from the UNFCCC - but in reality the US ceased effective participation in the UN's climate change body long ago.It remains unclear whether the move will be challenged in the US courts, as many campaigners are now urging.While the US constitution allows presidents to join treaties \"provided two thirds of Senators present concur\", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw. As such, it is uncertain a future president could reverse Trump's decision and opt back in simply by applying.These latest withdrawals come after the president  took the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time last year, and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. The US has also already withdrawn from the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN's cultural agency, Unesco.European leaders have criticised this latest decision, warning it would weaken global co-operation. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the UNFCCC \"underpins global climate action\" and called the US retreat \"regrettable and unfortunate\", while the EU's clean transition vice-president Teresa Ribera said the administration showed little concern for the environment, health or human suffering.A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a \"new low\".Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told news agency AFP that it was another sign the administration, which she described as \"authoritarian\" and \"anti- science\", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global co-operation.",

    "body": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission, the country's most powerful form of independent inquiry, into last month's shooting at Bondi Beach. The attack targeting a Jewish festival left 15 people dead, making it one of the deadliest in the country's history.Albanese had previously argued that reforms on gun ownership and hate speech, steps to tackle antisemitism and a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies offered the quickest response.But following weeks of public pressure, he said on Thursday that a royal commission was the best way forward after he had taken \"the time to reflect\" and meet with the Jewish community.\"I've repeatedly said that our government's priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \"It's clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this.\"Since the 14 December attack, the families of the victims, as well as a chorus of public figures, including lawyers, business people and athletes had led an almost daily campaign calling for him to reverse course and launch a royal commission.A royal commission has broad powers to investigate, the ability to summon witnesses and compel agencies to produce documents. It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers.The commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise:investigating the \"nature and prevalence of antisemitism\" and its \"key drivers\" in Australiamaking recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attackmaking any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremismThe prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April.Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that \"this won't be a drawn-out process.\" Previous royal commissions have taken years.\"This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,\" Albanese said.Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were \"serious concerns\" about her appointment, without specifying what they were.Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was \"an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision\".Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: \"It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider.\"He also added that the inquiry was not meant to \"provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East\".\"The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,\" Albanese said.In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme.Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\".He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report.Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism.Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was \"the right one and an important one\". \"It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,\" she said.",

    "body": "A pair of twin mountain gorillas has been born in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo - a rare occurrence for the endangered primates, conservationists at Virunga National Park say.The community trackers, who discovered 22-year-old Mafuko hugging her newborns on Saturday, said the mother and her two baby sons all appeared to be well and healthy. Twin births are thought to account for about 1% of all mountain gorilla births, though exact data is not widely available.Virunga, situated in a conflict-prone part of DR Congo, is Africa's oldest and largest national park and was set up 100 years ago to protect mountain gorillas of which there are fewer than 1,100 left in the wild.They are only found in the Virunga and in national parks over the border in Rwanda and Uganda, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which compiles a Red List of threatened species.The last birth of mountain gorilla twins in Virunga National Park was in September 2020.Mafuko herself gave birth to twins in 2016, but they both died within a week.Young gorillas rely entirely on their mothers for care and transport - and are extremely vulnerable in what can be a dangerous environment where poachers and many armed groups operate.The authorities at the park say additional monitoring and protection measures have been put in place to ensure the twins' survival during this critical period. Rangers would closely observe the young family and provide support if needed, they said.A gorilla's pregnancy lasts for about eight-and-a-half months, and females usually give birth to one infant every four years. According to Virunga conservationists, Mafuko has had a remarkable history of survival herself.Born in 2003 into the Kabirizi family, she lost her mother to armed attackers when she was four years old. She joined the Bageni family when she was 10 - and to date has been pregnant and given birth five times.Conservationists at Virunga, which is a Unesco World Heritage Site, say her latest offspring represent a significant boost for efforts to protect the endangered species.Thanks to anti-poaching patrols and community programmes - supported by the European Union and Unesco - mountain gorilla numbers in Virunga have slowly increased over the past decade.This success, which is documented by the IUCN and other partners, led to their status being upgraded from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" in 2018.Virunga spans 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) and is home to an astonishingly diverse landscape - from active volcanoes and vast lakes to rainforest and mountains.",

    "body": "The US has suspended all assistance to the government of Somalia, alleging that officials destroyed a UN World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse and seized \"donor-funded food aid\".\"The Trump administration has a zero-tolerance policy for waste, theft, and diversion of life-saving assistance,\" said a US state department statement on X.The message, posted on the account of the under secretary for foreign assistance, said reports had been received about officials illegally seizing 76 tonnes of food intended for \"vulnerable Somalis\".Somali has denied the allegations, saying that the expansion work under way in the Mogadishu port, where the warehouse is located, had not affected any aid storage.It stressed that all the humanitarian aid in question was still \"under the custody and control of the World Food Programme including assistance provided by the United States\".A WFP staff member in Mogadishu, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to the AFP news agency that the food aid had not been stolen.\"The warehouse was partially demolished during the weekend without the knowledge of the WFP team, but there was no looting involved,\" they said.The US said it would only resume assistance if the Somali government took \"accountability for its unacceptable actions and... appropriate remedial steps\".Although the US has withdrawn from several UN organisations under President Donald Trump, it remains by far the largest contributor to the WFP, paying $2bn (£1.5bn) in 2025 - almost a third of its total funding.Somalia's government is battling al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants as it tries to rebuild the country after a devastating civil war and years of drought.This is the latest example of the deteriorating relations between Washington and Mogadishu.Last month, Trump lashed out at Somali migrants living in the US, telling reporters they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\".Communities have been targeted in immigration raids as the government alleges large-scale benefit fraud in Minnesota, the US state with the largest Somali community in the US.The recent recognition by US ally Israel of the breakaway republic of Somaliland, which Somalia considers to be part of its territory, has further angered Mogadishu.The aid that was allegedly seized by Somali officials was meant to help people cope with the effects of \"drought, floods, conflict, high food prices and dwindling harvests\", according to the WFP.It quotes figures saying that 4.6 million people in Somalia are facing crisis levels of hunger.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSimon FraserAsia editor, BBC News websiteCambodia says it has extradited to China a billionaire businessman accused of masterminding a vast cryptocurrency scam in which trafficked workers were lured to forced labour camps to defraud victims globally.Chen Zhi was among three Chinese nationals arrested on 6 January after a joint investigation into transnational crime lasting several months, Cambodia said.The US charged the 37-year-old last October with running internet scams from Cambodia that it said had stolen billions in cryptocurrency. The UK also sanctioned his global business empire, Prince Group.Cambodian authorities have also suspended the operations of Prince Bank, a subsidiary of Prince Group.The bank has been placed in liquidation and banned from offering new banking services - though customers can still withdraw money and repay loans, the National Bank of Cambodia said on Thursday.China's state media confirmed Chen Zhi's extradition, describing him as \"the head of a major cross-border gambling and fraud syndicate... suspected of multiple crimes, including operating casinos, fraud, illegal business operations and concealing criminal proceeds\". CCTV said he had been \"placed under coercive measures in accordance with the law\".\"The public security organs will soon issue arrest warrants for the first batch of key members of Chen Zhi's criminal syndicate, resolutely bringing fugitives to justice,\" said CCTV. \"The public security organs solemnly warn criminals to recognise the situation, stop their crimes before it's too late, and immediately surrender themselves to the authorities to receive lenient treatment.\"Last year, US authorities seized about $15bn (£11bn) worth of bitcoin that it alleged belonged to Chen, in what FBI Director Kash Patel described as \"one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history\".The BBC contacted Prince Group for comment at the time. In the past, the Cambodia-based group has denied any involvement in scams. Its website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services.Since Chen Zhi was indicted by the US on fraud and money-laundering charges in October, his whereabouts have been unclear.But on Wednesday, the Cambodian authorities said they had \"arrested three Chinese nationals namely Chen Zhi, Xu Ji Liang, and Shao Ji Hui and extradited [them] to the People's Republic of China\". The interior ministry statement did not say where Chen Zhi had been detained.His Cambodian nationality had been revoked by royal decree last month, it added. The enigmatic tycoon had given up his Chinese nationality to become a Cambodian citizen in 2014.The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to South East Asia, many of them to Cambodia, lured by the promise of legitimate jobs and then forced to run online scams.People are held against their will in the scam farms and made to defraud strangers online under the threat of punishment or torture. Many of those trapped are Chinese and targeted people in China.Chinese authorities have also been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020. The company is accused of running online fraud schemes in a number of court cases.The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau established a task force to investigate the Prince Group, describing it as \"a major transnational online gambling syndicate based in Cambodia\".Cambodia's ruling elite have been close to Chen Zhi for years. The government has said little since the US and UK sanctioned Prince Group, apart from urging US and UK authorities to be sure they had sufficient evidence for their allegations.By some estimates, scam businesses may account for around half of the entire Cambodian economy.\"I think it's the sheer scale of his operations which really makes Chen Zhi stand out,\" Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who has investigated Chen Zhi, told the BBC last year.He said it was shocking the Prince Group had been able to build a \"global footprint\" without raising alarm bells, given the serious criminal charges it now faces.",

    "body": "US Vice-President JD Vance says Greenland is \"critical\" for the defence of the US and the world against possible Russian or Chinese missile attacks - and that Europe and Denmark have \"not done a good job\" in securing the area.Vance told Fox News that they had not only under-invested in Greenland's defences, but also failed to engage with President Donald Trump's argument over the issue.US officials are \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - the White House said on Wednesday, a day after suggesting military action to annex it to the US was also an option.Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance.Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale.Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.\"People do not realise that the entire missile defence infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland,\" Vance said in his interview on Wednesday.\"If God forbid the Russians and the Chinese - not saying they're going to - but if, God forbid, somebody launched a nuclear missile into our continent, they launched a nuclear missile at Europe, Greenland is a critical part of that missile defence. \"So you ask yourself, 'have the Europeans, have the Danes done a proper job of securing Greenland and of making sure it can continue to serve as an anchor for world security and missile defence?' And the answer is obviously they haven't,\" he said. Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he would hold talks with Denmark next week.A day earlier, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark.\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement.Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were \"a clear threat\".\"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she said.But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely and that instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\".Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership.\"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he told the BBC. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\"Saying that he did not have \"time for Trump\", he added that people were \"in need\". Hunters like him, he explained, hunted with dogs on the sea ice and fish \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen",

    "body": "52 minutes agoGuy HedgecoeMadridEPAThe deal is expected to expand the number of victims who can seek compensationSpain's Roman Catholic Church has reached an agreement with the government to compensate victims of sexual abuse by members of the clergy.The accord follows complaints that religious leaders had failed to tackle the issue adequately.It means the government will manage possible compensation in co-ordination with the Church, handling cases where other legal avenues are no longer available because the alleged crime took place too long ago or the individual accused has passed away.Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards are estimated by the government to have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Church figures. The move follows similar redress schemes in other nations where abuse has been uncovered.\"A democracy should not allow the existence of victims who have never been compensated [and] whose situation, on the contrary, had been covered up,\" said Justice Minister Félix Bolaños after signing the agreement.He added that the agreement sought to \"pay off an historic, moral debt that we had with victims of abuse within the Church\".The other signatories were Luis Argüello, president of the Episcopal Conference and leader of the Spanish Catholic Church, and Jesús Díaz Sariego, president of Confer, which represents Catholic congregations and religious orders.Mr Sariego said the initiative was unprecedented as it tackled crimes that had gone past the statute of limitations.Argüello, who is archbishop of Valladolid, described the accord as \"another step forward along the path that for years we have been travelling\".A 2023 study by the Spanish ombudsman's office, which investigates public complaints, estimated that 1.1% of the population had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of members of the clergy or individuals linked to the Church - the equivalent of 440,000 people.The Church has contested these findings. It set up a reparation scheme that year to manage abuse claims. However, both the Socialist-led government and victims' organisations have been dissatisfied with the scheme's model, which did not allow input or oversight from outside the Church.In November, the Church said that 58 cases had been \"resolved\" under its framework. However, critics accused the institution of a lack of transparency and slowness. Newspaper El País, which has created a database of clerical abuse allegations, has documented cases affecting 2,948 victims dating back as far as the 1940s.Last June, several victims' groups broke off ties with the Spanish Church, alleging that it had excluded them from seeking reparations. The Vatican subsequently appeared to take a more prominent role, with the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors meeting Spanish victims and urging the country's Catholic leaders to bolster and facilitate reparations. Meetings between Justice Minister Bolaños and the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, appear to have raised the pressure further on the Church authorities in Madrid.EPAPope Francis apologised many times about the scandal that shook the Catholic ChurchUnder the new system, victims will be able to file their cases before a new agency created by the justice ministry, which will then take them before the ombusdman's office, which will draw up a reparation proposal. The Church must then agree to the proposed compensation – if not, the case will be referred back to the ombudsman.Reparation can be symbolic, psychological, or economic, according to the agreement. In each case, the Church is responsible for its execution.The amount of financial compensation that could be paid out is not specified.However, the ombudsman has suggested following the lead of other European countries.In Belgium, an average of €6,000 ($7,000; £5,210) has been paid to victims in such cases, although the late Pope Francis described that amount as \"too small\".Ireland's redress board paid out an average of around €63,000 to victims.Sexual abuse by members of the clergy first received significant attention in the US and Canada in the 1980s.In the 1990s, the issue began to grow, with stories emerging in Argentina, Australia and revelations of widespread historical abuse in Ireland. By the early 2000s, sexual abuse within the Church was a major global story.Spain, a Catholic country, was affected by relatively few scandals in that time. However, investigations by the media have brought the issue to light more recently. In the most recent high-profile case, the bishop of Cádiz, Rafael Zornoza, resigned in November, following an accusation of abuse dating back to the 1990s.Victims' organisations have welcomed the new agreement in Spain.\"This is an endemic, structural evil which has been within the Church and which it should have tackled a long time ago instead of covering up paedophiles,\" said Juan Cuatrecasas, of the Association for Stolen Childhood (Anir), who said he was \"fully satisfied\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America online editorEPA/ShutterstockUS President Donald Trump has said that his country's involvement in Venezuela could last for years.He told the New York Times that \"only time will tell\" how long his administration would \"oversee\" the running of the South American nation following the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Saturday. Trump also did not say if or when elections would be held in Venezuela to replace the interim government headed by Maduro loyalist Delcy Rodríguez.Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said the ouster of Maduro had set off an \"irreversible process\" that would lead Venezuela to be \"free\".New York Times (NYT) journalists quizzed Trump on his plans for the future of Venezuela days after he had said his administration would run the oil-rich nation.Earlier on Wednesday, the White House had said that the US would control sales of sanctioned oil \"indefinitely\".US Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that the US needed control over Venezuela's oil sales for leverage over the interim government in Caracas. Trump said his administration would be \"taking oil\" from Venezuela, which has the world's largest proven reserves, but acknowledged it would \"take a while\" to get the country's oil industry up and running.Venezuela's oil production has plummeted as a result of mismanagement on the part of the Maduro government and that of his predecessor, as well as years of US sanctions.Watch: BBC Verify examines claims Venezuela \"stole\" US oilTrump told the NYT that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was \"in constant communication\" with Rodríguez, who was designated as Venezuela's interim leader by the country's Supreme Court, which is dominated by Maduro loyalists. He added that Rodríguez is \"giving us everything that we feel is necessary.\"The US president had earlier said that the interim government had agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to buy only US-made goods.According to the NYT reporters, Trump did not answer their questions about why he recognised Rodríguez as Venezuela's new leader.Many Venezuela analysts had expected that the ouster of Maduro would be followed swiftly by the return to the country of opposition leaders Edmundo González and María Corina Machado.But in his first news conference following the US raid, Trump was dismissive about  Machado, alleging that she lacked the \"respect\" and support to lead Venezuela. \"I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader,\" he said. Machado managed to unite opposition groups behind her ahead of the 2024 presidential election but was barred from running for the presidency by officials loyal to the Maduro government.She then threw her weight behind former diplomat González, who acted as her proxy.The electoral council, which is also dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro re-elected. However, voting tallies collected by the opposition, which have been independently verified, suggest González won by a landslide. González went into exile to escape the government repression that followed the election, and Machado went into hiding within Venezuela.She embarked on a perilous journey by land, sea and air to reach Oslo in December to collect the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded for her \"tireless work promoting democratic rights\" in Venezuela.Her current whereabouts are unknown but she has said that she plans to return to Venezuela soon.In an interview with Venezuelan opposition news site La Patilla, she insisted that the ousting of Maduro had set her country on an irreversible path towards freedom. She said that she hoped this new phase of the transition process would be \"as short and swift as possible\".She added that the interim government, which she said was \"the same regime it was under Maduro\" was \"being given instructions to dismantle itself\".Machado insisted that González was the legitimate president-elect and urged that his mandate be respected. She stressed that \"the first thing\" that needed to happen was for the political prisoners to be released. Machado is not the only one who has been demanding that the more than 800 political prisoners held in Venezuela's notorious jails be freed.On Wednesday, Republican lawmaker María Elvira Salazar published several posts on social media insisting they be released \"immediately\".However, in his interview with the NYT, Trump instead \"appeared far more focused on the rescue mission than the details of how to navigate Venezuela's future\", according to the journalists who spoke to him. Pressed on what the US plans for Venezuela are, he said that \"we will rebuild it in a very profitable way\".He added: \"We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need.\"The US president is expected to meet representatives of three of the largest US oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss those plans further.",

    "body": "18 hours agoJaroslav LukivandAna Faguy,on Capitol Hill in Washington DCWatch: Video shows moment US seize oil tanker in Caribbean seaThe United States says it has seized two tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in \"back-to-back\" operations in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean.US forces boarded the Russian-flagged Marinera after a pursuit lasting almost two weeks as it travelled through the waters between Iceland and Scotland. The UK Royal Navy gave logistical support by air and sea.A second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was accused by the US of \"conducting illicit activities\" and boarded in the Caribbean.The moves come as the US seeks to choke off most exports of Venezuelan crude oil, and just days after its special forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on his residence in Caracas.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X: \"The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT - anywhere in the world.\"Moscow has denounced the seizure of the tanker sailing under its flag, and demanded that the US treat Russians aboard properly and permits them to return to Russia quickly.The transport ministry said it had given the vessel \"temporary permission\" to use the Russian flag, adding that no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.Reports suggested that Russia dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel, but it appears that US forces were able to board the tanker without facing any resistance.The White House described the ship as a \"Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel deemed stateless after flying a false flag and had a judicial order\" against it.Venezuela's leadership is co-operating with the US on the second tanker seized in the Caribbean, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.\"They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they co-operate and work with the United States,\" he told reporters.Earlier, US President Donald Trump had said that Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US.Rubio, who briefed US lawmakers on the ongoing operation in Venezuela on Wednesday, said that the US would sell oil that is in Venezuela \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\".He said the US had a considered plan for the future of Venezuela, and that the administration was \"not just winging it\".Rubio said the Trump administration's plan in Venezuela was stabilisation, recovery and then transition.But the discussions surrounding oil were only one component of concern US lawmakers had over the escalating conflict.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers needed answers to lingering questions of how many US troops could be involved and how much money the US involvement in Venezuela will cost.Republicans largely appeared to back the administration's moves in the region, though some expressed concern about what kind of say Congress had.The Senate is expected to vote next week on a bipartisan war powers resolution - an attempt to block continued military action in Venezuela. A war powers resolution - created in the wake of the Vietnam War - limits a president's power to involve US armed forces in hostilities without congressional approval.\"If we're going to have continued engagement in the next phase, I think it has got to be subject to [war powers],\" North Carolina's Thom Tillis said.Meanwhile, Missouri's Josh Hawley said that if the administration's actions were a law enforcement operation, then it does not require congressional approval, but \"if it's a military operation involving a foreign head of government, even one we don't recognise officially, that's a very different situation\".China - the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil in recent years - has condemned the US moves and accused it of threatening global energy security.US European CommandA US Coast Guard official looks through binoculars at the ship Marinera (formerly named Bella 1)The seizure of the two tankers was announced by the US military in separate posts on social media on Wednesday.The US European Command said the M/V Bella 1 - using the former name of the Marinera - was boarded \"for violations of US sanctions\". \"The vessel was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a US federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro\", a Coast Guard cutter.Britain's Ministry of Defence said RAF surveillance aircraft and a naval support vessel, the RFA Tideforce, were among the UK military assets that took part in the operation, following a US request for assistance.Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was \"in full compliance with international law\", and \"formed part of global efforts to crack down on sanctions- busting\".The vessel has been accused of breaking US sanctions and shipping Iranian oil.Images published by Russian state broadcaster RT show a helicopter close to a ship that appears to be the M/V Bella 1.The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping shows that the tanker had changed its name to Marinera, and was sailing under the Russian flag. Its home port stated as the southern Russian city of Sochi on the Black Sea.The Russian transport ministry said US forces boarded the Marinera at about 15:00 Moscow time (1200 GMT), after which communications with the vessel were lost.US officials said that Marinera was falsely flying the flag of Guyana last month, which made it stateless.Experts told BBC Verify that the US called the ship Bella 1 as a vessel cannot change its flag during a voyage unless there was a real transfer of ownership or change of registry.The experts also said that under UN international maritime law, a stateless vessel can be boarded by authorities.Separately, the US Southern Command announced on Wednesday that the defence and homeland security departments \"apprehended a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker without incident\".\"The interdicted vessel, M/T Sophia, was operating in international waters and conducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea. The US Coast Guard is escorting M/T Sophia to the US for final disposition.\"The US Southern Command also posted a video showing a helicopter circling over a vessel.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that \"in two pre-dawn operations today, the Coast Guard conducted back-to-back meticulously co-ordinated boarding of two 'ghost fleet' tanker ships\".She said both seized vessels \"were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it\".",

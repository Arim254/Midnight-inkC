    "body": "16 hours agoMengchen Zhang, Jack Lau and Ankur ShahBBC Global China Unit and Eye InvestigationsBBCWarning: This report contains details of physical and sexual abuse and discussion of suicide.Baobao's heart still races when she smells soil after morning rain.It takes her back to early military drills behind locked gates - and the constant fear that marked every one of her days at Lizheng Quality Education School.For six months, aged 14, she barely left the red and white building in a remote Chinese village where instructors tried to \"fix\" young people whose families considered them rebellious or problematic.Students who failed to comply were beaten so severely they could not sleep on their backs or sit down for days, she says.\"Every single moment was agonising,\" says Baobao, now 19 and speaking under a pseudonym for fear of retribution.She says she considered suicide, and knows other students who attempted it.'Raped and beaten'A BBC Eye investigation has uncovered multiple allegations of physical abuse in the school and others in the same network, and cases of young people being abducted and taken to the institutions.Corporal punishment has been banned in China for decades, but we have collated testimony from 23 former students who say they were beaten or forced to do extreme amounts of exercise. One says she was raped, and two others, including Baobao, say they were sexually assaulted or harassed, all by instructors.Undercover filming has exposed how staff pose as authorities to forcibly transfer young people to their institutions.Thirteen students say they were abducted, with parental consent, by employees pretending to be police or officials.The accounts - from interviews by the BBC World Service, statements gathered by activists, police reports and state media - relate to five schools. These are part of a network of at least 10 schools, all of which have been run by - or have close links to - a military veteran called Li Zheng.Baobao says every single moment at the school was \"agonising\"The centres are part of a booming industry promising anxious parents that military-style discipline will resolve concerns over young people's disobedience, internet addiction, teenage dating and depression, as well as gender and sexual identity. Some parents even send over-18s, who are legally adults.A series of abuse allegations have made headlines in China in recent years, in both Li Zheng schools and others.In a few cases, arrests have been made or institutions shut down, but schools can be quick to reopen with different names or in different locations because the sector has been difficult to regulate. The BBC understands that Mr Li was arrested earlier this year, but we have discovered his associates have recently opened a new school.Companies and individuals involved in the network could either not be reached or declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in the UK told the BBC all educational institutions are required to comply with regulations.'Deeply offensive' body searchBaobao says her mother took her to the Lizheng Quality Education School in Hunan province when she began skipping classes, triggering rows which made their already difficult relationship worse.Her mother left while she was being shown around the school, she says, and she then realised she was not allowed to leave: \"They said if I behaved well, I might be able to get out.\"Baobao initially tried to kick and punch the instructors, she says, but decided to comply when they tried to restrain her with her own shoelaces. Later, she was searched. She describes the way this was done as sexual assault. \"I found it deeply offensive… she touched all my sensitive areas.\"She says her mother paid about 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months at the institution, and she was not given any academic lessons. Few disciplinary schools offer these, and some that do charge extra for them.The school is still operating, now known as Quality Education for Teenagers, with around 300 students, aged eight to 18.Undercover footage was filmed there earlier this year by a woman posing as a parent considering enrolling her fictional 15-year-old son. She said he was smoking, dating and driving her car.She was shown locked gates on staircases, metal grilles along open-air corridors and CCTV monitoring dormitories where children rest, get changed and shower.Filmed undercover, a staff member says Quality Education for Teenagers uses a \"white lie\" when it takes students to the schoolA staff member told her it would take at least six months to improve the teenager's behaviour, but under a \"three-year warranty\" she could send him back paying for just food and accommodation if he reverted to his old ways.She was told not to tell him about the new school. \"When we arrange pick-ups, we tell a white lie,\" the staff member said.She explained instructors impersonating officials from the \"internet regulator\" would say they needed him to help with an investigation, and take him to the centre. \"If this fails, several instructors will simply restrain him and carry him to the vehicle,\" she said.Another former student, Zhang Enxu, now aged 20, says she had a similar experience when she was taken to a different school in the network.Then 19, she had left home, frustrated with her parents' refusal to accept her transgender identity and her decision to live as a woman - she was registered male at birth. She says she had returned for a family visit to her grandmother's grave, when three men claiming to be police appeared, saying her details had been used in fraud.\"They forcibly dragged me into the car. My parents stood by as I was taken away,\" she says.Enxu says she was beaten and raped at the disciplinary school she was taken to at the age of 19She was taken to Shengbo Youth Psychological Growth Training School in Hunan where she says she was beaten, leaving her with hearing loss in one ear, and later raped.In the undercover footage from the school Baobao attended, a staff member says there are no beatings: \"We change the behaviour of youngsters with military training and counselling.\"But Baobao and Enxu describe a very different experience.\"Corporal punishment is ever-present,\" says Baobao. \"If your dance routines or military boxing lack precision, or are poorly executed, you will be punished.\"She said the instructors would use a pipe, raising it overhead before \"bringing it down with force\" on her classmates. \"Where they hit you would turn black. You get severe bruising.\"Videos obtained and verified by the BBC, that were filmed at another of Li Zheng's schools, show instructors raising a rod high and striking students' hands.Enxu says the students were forced to do \"enormous\" amounts of physical training. She said instructions to carry out exercises like push-ups \"might start at a thousand repetitions\".She also says she was attacked in her dormitory by an instructor on night duty: \"He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the floor, then he sexually assaulted me.\"Enxu's parents were sent videos of her at the school taking part in drills and counselling sessionsBaobao says she considered trying to kill herself, but realised she would be caught in the hours it would take her to die.She says one of her classmates did attempt to take her own life, but instead of taking her to hospital, the instructors tried to flush her stomach themselves.Both Baobao and Enxu describe counselling sessions where little understanding was shown.Enxu's sessions were videoed for her parents, who she says had paid 65,800 yuan ($9,300, £7,000) for six months. \"Be a happy, healthy, positive boy. All right?\" she is urged. \"You're a boy, do what boys do… just be happy.\"Baobao says that when she told the counsellor she wanted to end her life, the response was: \"If you were going to die, you wouldn't be sitting here in front of me.\"\"Is that something a caring person would say? Are they even human?\" she asks.Both students wondered how their parents could have decided to subject them to the experience.Enxu's mother wept as she told the BBC the family had been \"deceived\" by the school's promises: \"Not only did you swindle someone out of their money, but you also tore their family apart, causing a breakdown in their relationship.\"Footage obtained by the BBC that was filmed at one of Li Zheng's schools shows an instructor hitting a student on the handSocial pressure to have academically successful children plays a major role in parents' decisions - particularly among urban middle-class families - to send their children to disciplinary schools, says Dr Yichen Rao, an anthropologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.He has studied internet addiction centres for young people in China, and says lack of support in the school system, anxiety, and conflict within the family can combine to make parents \"feel that they have no other choices\".Baobao's mother declined to comment. Her daughter says she can now \"understand both sides\": \"I think she was brainwashed by the slogans used to sell the school. She was desperate for me to become more obedient… to be the daughter she always wanted.\"Baobao managed to leave after feigning an eye problem. Her mother simply said \"let's turn the page\", leaving her angry and confused, she recalls.Viral lettersEnxu's ordeal ended after a month. Her friends realised she was missing and contacted the police, who then located her and shared a video of her at the school. Her friend Wang Yuhang identified the school by asking in online groups about the green uniform she was wearing.Enxu discreetly documented her experience in letters that were smuggled out and posted online. They went viral and as public pressure grew, the police intervened and she was allowed to leave.Twelve days later, authorities announced Shengbo school was closing, but made no reference to the abuse Enxu alleged, saying, however, that the school had violated administrative regulations.She says the police later told her Li Zheng had been arrested, accused of involvement in organised crime. The police did not respond to BBC requests for information about Enxu's case and Mr Li. The local education department have also not responded.Secret filmingUndercover footage shows students doing military-style drills at a new school set up by former employees of Li Zheng schoolsMr Li keeps a relatively low public profile. The BBC has analysed his network and found it operates disciplinary schools across four provinces through a complex set of companies registered to him or his close associates.He founded his first centre in 2006 and has owned four different education companies at different times.The website of one of his organisations says he is a graduate of a Chinese Air Force academy in southern China, and worked as a \"director of training\" and \"senior psychological counsellor\" at several schools from 2007.On local television in Hunan province, he once spoke about nurturing young people with \"love and patience\".Chinese authorities have intervened before, following allegations about schools in the network.An instructor at a different Li Zheng school was detained by police in 2019 after allegations he had beaten students with water pipes.Also, according to Chinese media reports, the school Baobao attended was ordered to stop admissions after a student suicide in 2020. She was there at the time and says it continued to operate over that period. It changed its name soon afterwards.Mu Zhou, an Australia-based volunteer who has been helping document allegations of abuse, says \"whenever there's public outcry, he [Li Zheng] would alter the name or change the legal representative\". He also says students are bussed between different sites to avoid inspections.'Huge profits'Two undercover researchers recently visited what may be the latest addition to the Li Zheng network.Posing as investors in the Hong Kong education sector, the researchers set up a meeting with three former employees of Li Zheng schools, in a new school they have set up in Fujian.\"The profits in this industry are huge,\" Li Yunfeng, the director of counselling at the new school, told them. He outlined how the business model could work in Hong Kong, suggesting fees of at least $25,000 (£19,000) per student annually.He declined to disclose the name of their boss, but said he was \"a veteran\".He appeared to distance himself from the network, however, telling the undercover researchers: \"There were some incidents. The parents lodged a complaint. The group... though not formally dissolved yet, it's teetering on the brink of collapse. That's why I stepped out.\"Secret filmingLi Yunfeng told undercover researchers the previous group was \"on the brink of collapse\" but he is helping open a new schoolThe BBC was not able to reach Li Zheng, Li Yunfeng and other schools and companies linked to Li Zheng and his associates for comment, despite multiple attempts.The staff member who provided a tour of the Quality Education for Teenagers school declined to comment. The education department which oversees the school could not be reached, despite multiple attempts.Regulating these disciplinary centres is difficult. Some are not registered as schools. The responsibility is split between local education, civil affairs and market regulation authorities, a Chinese lawyer familiar with lawsuits against such institutions, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC.Dr Rao says that with no centralised regulation over the disciplinary schools, the responsibility tends to fall to local government.He describes it as a \"shadowy industry that the state just tolerates\", adding that the state may not wish to give it legitimacy by providing regulation or guidelines.But, he adds, there is a \"spectrum\" of schools, with some incorporating psychotherapy for students and training for parents, or disciplining staff who carry out corporal punishment.The Chinese embassy in London said the government \"attaches great importance to the lawful operation of educational institutions and the protection of minors\". It says all educational institutions \"are required to comply with relevant laws and regulations\".'Terribly sad'Enxu and her friend Wang want to see all disciplinary schools shut down. They work to gather video evidence of abuse and abduction, believing this is crucial to get the police to investigate, sometimes posting it online.Wang often receives requests from students. He has helped with the logistics of escape attempts and by pressuring schools to allow students to leave.Baobao never returned to education, which she says makes her feel \"terribly sad\". She now makes a living through online streaming and gaming, but believes she might have gone to university if she had not been sent to the Lizheng Quality Education School.\"These schools are essentially scams,\" she says.\"The prevailing educational ethos is one of violence begetting violence… the very concept is fundamentally flawed,\" she says, adding that they \"simply shouldn't exist\".Details of organisations offering information and support with mental health, distress or despair, or sexual abuse or violence, are available at BBC ActionLine.Additional reporting by Alex Mattholie and Shanshan Chen",

    "body": "6 hours agoDipali Jagtap and Cherylann MollanGlobal fashion brand Prada has announced a line of limited-edition footwear inspired by Indian-made Kolhapuri sandals, months after it faced backlash for allegedly appropriating the sandal's design.The Italian luxury brand will make 2,000 pairs of sandals in India's Maharashtra and Karnataka states, under a deal with two state-backed entities, Reuters news agency reports.\"We'll mix the original manufacturer's standard capabilities with our manufacturing techniques\", Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada's head of Corporate Social Responsibility, said.The collection is set to go on sale in February 2026, online and in 40 Prada stores across the world. A pair of sandals are reportedly set to be sold for $939, which amounts to around £800 and 84,000 rupees.The agreement was signed on Thursday during the Italy-India Business Forum 2025.In June, Prada courted controversy after it showcased sandals that had an open-toe braided pattern that closely resembled the traditional Kolhapuri sandals made in Maharashtra and Karnataka.Prada described the sandals as \"leather footwear\" but did not mention its Indian origins, prompting backlash and allegations of cultural appropriation in India.The brand later acknowledged the footwear design's Indian roots.A Prada spokesperson at that time told the BBC that the company has \"always celebrated craftsmanship, heritage and design traditions\", adding that it was \"in contact with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture on this topic\". This is a prominent industry trade body in the state.On Friday, Maharashtra's Social Justice Minister Sanjay Shirsat told BBC Marathi that the new initiative will be called 'Prada Made in India – Inspired by Kolhapuri Chappals [sandals]'.\"Keeping in mind Prada's requirements and demand, some artisans will receive special training from Prada and LIDCOM [a state-backed entity supporting the leather industry in Maharashtra]. Additionally, around 200 Kolhapuri chappal artisans will be given three years of training in Italy,\" he said.Mr Shirsat said the agreement had been signed for five years, but expressed confidence that it would be extended further. \"The state government will also provide financial assistance to the artisans for this purpose,\" he added. Named after a city in Maharashtra where they are made, Kolhapuri sandals trace their roots back to the 12th Century.Made from leather and sometimes dyed in natural colours, the traditional handcrafted sandals are sturdy and well-suited to India's hot climate.Following the controversy, many artisans in Kolhapur said they were saddened by Prada's use of the design without giving due credit.",

    "body": "George WrightandBethany Bell,BerlinGermany has accused Russia of a cyber-attack on air traffic control and attempted electoral interference, and summoned the Russian ambassador. A foreign ministry spokesman said Russian military intelligence was behind a \"cyber-attack against German air traffic control in August 2024\".The spokesman also accused Russia of seeking to influence and destabilise the country's federal election in February this year. The latest accusations come amid heightened concern in Europe over suspected Russian cyber-attacks since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.There was no immediate response from Russia.The foreign ministry added that Germany - in close co-ordination with its European partners - would respond with counter-measures to make Russia \"pay a price for its hybrid actions\".In the last year, both the UK and Romania have accused Russia of meddling in their domestic affairs, including targeting organisations that deliver foreign assistance to Ukraine and presidential elections.The spokesman said the August 2024 cyber-attack on Germany could be attributed to the Fancy Bear Russian hacker group.\"Our intelligence findings prove that the Russian military intelligence service GRU bears responsibility for this attack,\" he added.The ministry spokesman added it was now certain that Moscow had attempted to  \"influence and destabilise both the last federal election and the ongoing internal affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany\" through a disinformation campaign called Storm 1516.The campaign, it said, had focused in part on lead Green Party candidate Robert Habeck and lead CDU candidate Friedrich Merz, who is now chancellor.The German government said security agencies had identified fake videos alleging ballot manipulation as part of a Russian disinformation effort just days before the election.Its air navigation service provider confirmed that its office communication had been hacked in August 2024. It said flights had not been affected.Fancy Bear is said to have previously leaked World Anti-Doping Agency data, and played a key role in the 2016 cyber-attack on the US Democratic National Committee, according to security experts.Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to a major deterioration in relations between Berlin and Moscow.Germany has emerged as one of Ukraine's most vocal supporters, providing military, financial and diplomatic support for Kyiv.Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called strongly for frozen Russian assets to be used to help protect Ukraine.He has also repeatedly accused Russia of cyber warfare against his country.But relations have been strained for years, even before the Russian invasion. In 2019, an ethnic Chechen was killed by a Russian national, Vadim Krasikov, in broad daylight in Berlin's Tiergarten Park. Germany later expelled two Russian diplomats, as prosecutors suspected that he was acting on the orders of Russia's state security agency.While it is yet to respond to the latest allegations, Moscow has previously denied  European allegations of a Russian sabotage or hybrid campaign.",

    "body": "16 hours agoNavin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World ServiceOrangutan Information CentreThe Tapanuli orangutan was only discovered by scientists to be a separate species in 2017 – distinct from the Sumatran and Bornean apesAn unusual silence in the forests of north Sumatra in Indonesia is worrying wildlife experts and conservationists. Here, in the mountainous forests of Batang Toru, is where they had always seen and heard the world's rarest ape, the Tapanuli orangutans.But ever since Cyclone Senyar devastated Sumatra on 25 November, the critically endangered primates have not been seen in the area, conservation workers say.Their absence has fuelled speculation as to whether the great apes were swept away by floods and landslides. And while some believe the animals may have travelled to a safer location, a carcass found in the area, said to be that of an orangutan, is fuelling conservationists' fears.Fewer than 800 Tapanuli orangutans remain and any loss would have a serious impact on the species, conservationists say.Humanitarian workers told the BBC they found the dead animal semi-buried in the debris of mud and logs in Pulo Pakkat village in central Tapanuli district earlier this week.\"When I first saw it I was not sure what it was, because it was kind of defaced, perhaps because it was buried underneath by the sludge and logs,\" said Deckey Chandra, who has been working with a humanitarian team in the area. He previously worked in the conservation of the Tapanuli orangutans.\"I have seen several dead bodies of humans in the past few days but this was the first dead wildlife,\" he said. \"They used to come to this place to eat fruits. But now it seems to have become their graveyard.\"Getty ImagesCyclone Senyar swept across Sumatra in late November, devastating the Indonesian islandMr Chandra shared with the BBC pictures he took of the carcass, some of which show him with the dead animal.Conservationists working in the region believe it is of the Tapanuli orangutan, a species that was only discovered in 2017. The other two species are Bornean and Sumatran orangutans.More than 900 people have died as a result of heavy rain, floods and landslides since Cyclone Senyar ravaged parts of Indonesia in late November. Hundreds are still missing, with many villages in Sumatra completely destroyed as the storm swept across the island.Professor Erik Meijaard, managing director of Borneo Futures in Brunei, is now studying the disasters' impact on the orangutans with the help of satellite images.He said 4,800 hectares (11,860 acres)  of forest on the mountain slopes can be seen as destroyed by landslides - but since part of the satellite image is cloud covered, he's extrapolated the destruction figure to 7,200 hectares in his preliminary observation.\"The destroyed areas would have contained some 35 orangutans, and considering the violence of the destruction it wouldn't surprise us if they are all dead. That's a major blow to the population,\" he told the BBC.\"These areas show as bare soil on satellite imagery where two weeks ago it was primary forest. Complete destruction. Many patches of several hectares completely denuded. It must have been hellish in the forest at the time.\"Prof Mejjard said he too has seen the picture of the dead orangutan shared by Chandra.\"What struck me is that all the flesh had been ripped off the face,\" he said. \"If a few hectares of forest comes down in massive landslides, even powerful orangutans are helpless and just get mangled.\"Panut Hadisiswoyo, founder of Orangutan Information Centre which works for the conservation of the primates in the region, said the carcass meant it was highly possible some Tapanuli orangutans were unable to escape as rushing waters and landslides swept through their habitat.Getty ImagesExperts suggest that as much as 7,200 hectares of forest was destroyed in the recent cyclonePictures showing the carcass of a Sumatran elephant, another critically endangered species, being swept away by floods in Aceh in northern Sumatra went viral on social media last week.The island hosts a range of endangered species like Sumatran tigers, elephants and rhinos.But conservation workers say there are particular concerns for orangutans and other primates, like gibbons, because huge parts of the mountainous forest in the Tapanuli district saw massive landslides due to Cyclone Senyar's extreme rainfall.Some locals say the primates must have escaped before the disaster struck, as they can sense danger beforehand. But some primate experts say that may not have been the case.\"During heavy rains orangutans either just sit in a tree or gather branches and leaves to use as an umbrella and then wait for the rain to stop,\" said Serge Wich, professor of primate biology at Liverpool John Moores University, who has conducted research on Tapanuli orangutans.\"But this time, by the time the rain stopped it was too late: parts of their habitat - the slopes of valleys - were wiped out by landslides, which means there must have been consequences for them.\"The recent floods have also damaged a number of orangutan research centres in Sumatra - including at Ketambe, the world's first orangutan research centre, in Aceh.Dr Ian Singleton, scientific director for the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme, said the Ketambe centre is now almost completely destroyed. \"It needs to be rebuilt as soon as possible so it can continue to play that role in protecting the forests in that area and its orangutans.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoYang TianReutersNemo made history by becoming the first non-binary performer to win Eurovision in 2024The winner of last year's Eurovision Song Contest, Nemo, has said they are returning their trophy in protest over Israel's continued participation in the event.The 26-year-old Swiss singer said there was a \"clear conflict\" between Israel's involvement in the competition and the ideals of \"unity, inclusion and dignity\" the contest says it stands for.Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said Eurovision was \"saddened\" by the decision and respected Nemo's views.Israel's presence at Eurovision has been an increasing source of tension, because of the war in Gaza and a voting controversy during this year's event.Five countries - Iceland, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands - have announced they will boycott next year's event because Israel has been allowed to compete.Israel has previously called the decision to keep it in the contest a \"victory\" over critics who had tried to silence it and spread hatred.Nemo became the first non-binary performer to lift the Eurovision trophy with their song The Code, which is about the path to realising they were non-binary.After the win, Nemo told the BBC about the challenges they faced during the contest and their feeling that organisers had not done enough to support participants caught up in the row over Israel's inclusion in 2024.\"I felt very alone. I really hope they have things in place for the next year,\" Nemo said at the time. It prompted a series of new measures to be introduced to protect the mental well-being of Eurovision's artists and staff.In a statement posted to Instagram on Thursday, Nemo said they felt the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) decision to allow Israel to still take part in the event no longer aligned with its core values.\"Israel's continued participation, during what the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry has concluded to be a genocide, shows a clear conflict between those ideals and the decision made by the EBU,\" they said, referring to a report released in September.\"Even though I am immensely grateful for the community around this contest and everything this experience has taught me both as a person and artist, today I no longer feel this trophy belongs on my shelf.\"Nemo also posted a video of them placing the trophy in a cardboard box, saying it will be sent back to the EBU's headquarters in Geneva.In a statement sent to BBC News, Martin Green said: \"We're saddened that Nemo wishes to return their trophy which they deservedly won in 2024. \"We respect the deeply held views Nemo has expressed and they will always remain a valued part of the Eurovision family\"EPANemo performing at the 2024 Eurovision in Malmo, SwedenThe boycotts and protests over Israel's inclusion have been the biggest crisis Eurovision has ever seen.This year's competition also had a voting controversy and allegations that Israel's government tried to influence the public vote.This prompted some competition rules to be changed and tightened, after which a \"large majority\" of members agreed there was no need for a further vote on participation and that Eurovision 2026 could proceed as planned, the EBU has said.Israel's President Isaac Herzog has praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it an \"appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation\".Addressing the boycotts, Nemo insisted that their decision to hand back the trophy was not about \"individuals or artists\", but rather what they believed was the use of Eurovision to \"soften the image of a state accused of severe wrongdoing\".\"When entire countries withdraw, it should be clear that something is deeply wrong,\" they added.\"If the values we celebrate on stage aren't lived off stage then even the most beautiful songs become meaningless.\"The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,370 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Next year's Eurovision is due to take place in Vienna, for what is supposed to be a celebratory 70th anniversary edition of the contest.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMatt MurphyBBC Verify    BBCA Sudanese paramilitary commander, whose role in the el-Fasher massacre was revealed by BBC Verify, has been sanctioned by the UK government.Brig Gen Al-Fateh Abdullah Idris, also known as Abu Lulu, was filmed shooting dead at least 10 unarmed captives after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city in late October.Thousands of people are believed to have been killed by the RSF after the army withdrew from el-Fasher. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the atrocities taking place in Sudan were \"a scar on the conscience of the world\" which \"cannot, and will not, go unpunished.\"The UK has also sanctioned three other RSF commanders, including deputy head Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo.Dagalo, who was also placed under EU sanctions in November, was shown in verified footage touring an army base in the city in the hours after el-Fasher fell. He is the brother of RSF chief Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Dagalo.Sudan's civil war - sparked after the RSF and the military's fragile ruling coalition collapsed - has now raged for more than two years, killing hundreds of thousands of people and displacing millions more.El-Fasher was the army's last major stronghold in Darfur, the traditional stronghold of the RSF paramilitary.An investigation by BBC Verify revealed the brutal tactics used by the RSF during the protracted siege, which included detaining and torturing people trying to smuggle supplies into the city and building a massive sand barrier around it to prevent civilians and army troops from escaping.In its statement announcing the sanctions, the UK foreign office said it believed that Abu Lulu was \"responsible for violence against individuals based on ethnicity and religion, and the deliberate targeting of civilians\".Footage confirmed by BBC Verify in October showed Abu Lulu executing several unarmed captives with an AK-style rifle in a sandy, dusty area north-west of the city. RSF troops who witnessed the incidents were later seen celebrating their commander's actions.UK officials accused Abu Lulu, Dagalo, Gedo Hamdan Ahmed and Tijani Ibrahim Moussa Mohamed of carrying out \"heinous\" acts of violence, including mass killings, systematic sexual violence and deliberate attacks on civilians. The men have been placed under travel bans and any assets they hold will be frozen.\"Today's sanctions against RSF commanders strike directly at those with blood on their hands, while our strengthened aid package will deliver lifesaving support to those suffering,\" Cooper said.Citing satellite images - previously published by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab - the foreign office said piles of bodies and mass graves could be seen in el-Fasher after the massacre.Cooper also pledged an additional £21m to provide food, shelter and health services for civilians impacted by fighting in remote areas.In the days that followed the el-Fasher massacre, RSF leader Gen Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Dagalo admitted that his troops had committed \"violations\" and said the incidents would be investigated.Among those arrested was Abu Lulu. In a carefully choreographed and edited video posted on the RSF's official Telegram account he is shown being led into a cell at a prison, which was geolocated by BBC Verify to the outskirts of el-Fasher.The commander, who previously featured heavily in propaganda videos posted online, has not been seen since his arrest. A TikTok account that documented his activities was removed by the company in October after BBC Verify approached the tech giant for comment.The UK's move comes just two days after the US announced its own set of sanctions against a network of companies and individuals it accused of recruiting former Colombian soldiers and training individuals to fight in Sudan's civil war.The US Treasury Department said that hundreds of Colombian mercenaries have travelled to Sudan since 2024, including to serve as infantry and drone pilots for the RSF.Last month, US President Donald Trump pledged to \"start working on Sudan\" alongside Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, posting on social media that \"tremendous atrocities\" were taking place.",

    "body": "21 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorThierry Monasse/Getty ImagesUkraine's president says it is right for Russia's frozen assets to be used to rebuild his countryRussia is taking legal action in response to moves by Ukraine's European allies to use Moscow's frozen assets to help Kyiv fund its military and economy.The Russian Central Bank is suing Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court, and Russian officials accuse the EU of an act of theft.Ukraine is running out of cash, after almost four years of Russia's full-scale war.For Europe, the solution to plugging Kyiv's budget hole of €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) for the next two years lies in frozen cash held by Euroclear, and EU leaders hope to sign that off at their Brussels summit next week.'Only fair' to use Russia's assets In total, Russia has about €210bn of its assets, frozen in the EU within days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and €185bn of that is held by Euroclear.The EU and Ukraine argue that money should be used to rebuild what Russia has destroyed: Brussels calls it a \"reparations loan\" and has come up with a plan to prop up Ukraine's economy to the tune of €90bn.\"It's only fair that Russia's frozen assets should be used to rebuild what Russia has destroyed – and that money then becomes ours,\" says Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz says the assets will \"enable Ukraine to protect itself effectively against future Russian attacks\".Russia's court action was expected in Brussels. But it is not just Moscow that is unhappy.Belgium is worried it will be saddled with an enormous bill if it all goes wrong and Euroclear chief executive Valérie Urbain says using it could \"destabilise the international financial system\".Euroclear also has an estimated €16-17bn immobilised in Russia.Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever has set the EU a series of \"rational, reasonable, and justified conditions\" before he will accept the reparations plan, and he has refused to rule out legal action if it \"poses significant risks\" for his country.EPA/ShutterstockBelgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever discussed Europe's frozen assets plan with  UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on FridayWhat is the EU's plan?The EU is working to the wire ahead of next Thursday's summit to come up with a solution that Belgium can accept.Until now the EU has held off touching the assets themselves directly but since last year has paid the \"windfall profits\" from them to Ukraine. In 2024 that was €3.7bn. Legally using the interest is seen as safe as Russia is under sanction and the proceeds are not Russian sovereign property.But international military aid for Ukraine has slipped dramatically in 2025, and Europe has struggled to make up the shortfall left by the US decision to all but stop funding Ukraine under President Donald Trump.There are currently two EU proposals aimed at providing Ukraine with €90bn, to cover two-thirds of its funding needs.One is to raise the money on capital markets, backed by the EU budget as a guarantee. This is Belgium's preferred option but it requires a unanimous vote by EU leaders and that would be difficult when Hungary and Slovakia object to funding Ukraine's military.That leaves loaning Ukraine cash from the Russian assets, which were originally held in securities but have now largely matured into cash. That money is Euroclear property held in the European Central Bank.The EU's executive, the European Commission, accepts Belgium has legitimate concerns and says it is confident it has dealt with them.The plan is for Belgium to be protected with a guarantee covering all the €210bn of Russian assets in the EU.Should Euroclear suffer a loss of its own assets in Russia, a Commission source explained that would be offset from assets belonging to Russia's own clearing house which are in the EU.If Russia went after Belgium itself, any ruling by a Russian court would not be recognised in the EU.In a key development, EU ambassadors are expected to agree on Friday to immobilise Russia's central bank assets held in Europe indefinitely.Until now they have had to vote unanimously every six months to renew the freeze, which could have meant a repeated risk to Belgium.The EU ambassadors are set to use an emergency clause under Article 122 of the EU Treaties so the assets remain frozen as long as an \"immediate threat to the economic interests of the union\" continues.Thierry Monasse/Getty ImagesThe German chancellor (L) says the EU's plan will enable Ukraine to defend itselfWhy Belgium is not yet satisfiedBelgium is adamant it remains a staunch ally of Ukraine, but sees legal risks in the plan and fears being left to handle the repercussions if things go wrong.A usually divided political landscape in this case has rallied behind Prime Minister Bart de Wever, who is under pressure from European colleagues and having talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in London on Friday.\"Belgium is a small economy. Belgian GDP is about €565bn – imagine if it would need to shoulder a €185bn bill,\" says Veerle Colaert, professor of financial law at KU Leuven University.While the EU might be able to secure sufficient guarantees for the loan itself, Belgium fears an added risk of being exposed to extra damages or penalties.Prof Colaert also believes the requirement for Euroclear to grant a loan to the EU would violate EU banking regulations.\"Banks need to comply with capital and liquidity requirements and shouldn't put all their eggs in one basket. Now the EU is telling Euroclear to do just that.\"Why do we have these bank rules? It's because we want banks to be stable. And if things go wrong it would fall to Belgium to bail out Euroclear. That's another reason why it's so important for Belgium to secure water-tight guarantees for Euroclear.\"Europe under pressure from every directionThere is no time to lose, warn seven EU member states including those closest to Russia such as the Baltics, Finland and Poland. They believe the frozen assets plan is \"the most financially feasible and politically realistic solution\".\"It's a matter of destiny for us,\" says leading German conservative MP Norbert Röttgen. \"If we fail, I don't know what we'll do afterwards. That's why we have to succeed in a week's time\".While Russia is adamant its money should not be touched, there are added concerns among European figures that the US may want to use Russia's frozen billions differently, as part of its own peace plan.Zelensky has said Ukraine is working with Europe and the US on a reconstruction fund, but he is also aware the US has been talking to Russia about future co-operation. An early draft of the US peace plan referred to $100bn of Russia's frozen assets being used by the US for reconstruction, with the US taking 50% of the profits and Europe adding another $100bn. The remaining assets would then be used in some kind of US-Russia joint investment project.An EU source said the added advantage of Friday's expected vote to immobilise Russia's assets indefinitely made it harder for anyone to take the money away. Implicit is that the US would then have to win over a majority of EU member states to vote for a plan that would financially cost them an enormous sum.",

    "body": "Disguises, freezing waves, and a special forces veteran: Inside mission to sneak Nobel winner out of Venezuela2 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, São Paulo'The journey was not fun. It was cold, it was very wet' - Bryan SternThe rescue operation to get Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate María Corina Machado out of Venezuela involved disguises, two boats through choppy seas and a flight, the man who says he led it told the BBC.Dubbed Operation Golden Dynamite, the dangerous journey was cold, wet and long - but the \"formidable\" Machado didn't complain once, said Bryan Stern, a US special forces veteran and founder of the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation.\"The seas are very rough. It's pitch black. We're using flashlights to communicate. This is very scary, lots of things can go wrong.\"Despite the risks, they didn't. Machado arrived safely in Oslo, Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize just before midnight on Wednesday.Machado had been living in hiding in her own country since Venezuela's widely disputed elections last year, and hadn't been seen in public since January. Her grown-up children, who she hadn't seen in two years, were in Oslo to greet her.Grey Bull specialises in rescue missions and evacuations, especially from conflict and disaster zones. A representative from Machado's team confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the organisation was behind her rescue operation.Mr Stern said that Grey Bull had been building up a presence in the Caribbean, including inside Venezuela and the neighbouring island of Aruba, for months to get ready for potential operations in Venezuela.\"We've been building infrastructure on the ground in Venezuela designed to get Americans, allies and Brits and other people out should the war in Venezuela start,\" he told the BBC.Speculation has been mounting over possible US military action against Venezuela, after US President Donald Trump called on President Maduro to leave office, accusing him of sending narcotics and murderers to the US.Mr Stern said the challenge in this case was getting somebody out who is as well-known as María Corina Machado - a household name in Venezuela for the opposition.None of the infrastructure his firm had built up in the country, he said, was \"designed for the second most popular person in the damn country with a target on her back.\"Watch: María Corina Machado on her 'very dangerous' escape from VenezuelaWhen he was first put in contact with Machado's team, they did not initially disclose her identity, but Mr Stern said he was able to guess. When they got in touch with him in early December, through a contact who knew Machado's team, it was apparently the second attempt to get her out of Venezuela, after an initial plan \"didn't go well,\" Mr Stern said.The operation was dubbed \"Golden Dynamite\" because \"Nobel invented dynamite\" and Machado was trying to get to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize award.Matters moved quickly. Mr Stern said he spoke with the team on a Friday, they deployed on the Sunday, and by Tuesday, their mission was complete.His team had explored various possibilities to get Machado out of the country, and settled on a plan that involved a tumultuous sea journey.To protect his future work in Venezuela, Mr Stern can only reveal so much about the trip.By land, they moved Machado from a house where she was in hiding, to a pick-up spot for a small boat, which took her off the coast to a slightly bigger boat where she met up with him.The voyage was in \"very rough seas\" with waves of up to 10ft (3m) in \"pitch-black darkness,\" he said.\"The journey was not fun. It was cold, it was very wet, we were all soaked, the waves were very rough, and we used that to our advantage. We got her to land and to where her plane was, and she flew to Norway.\"Amanda Pedersen Giske/NTB via ReutersMachado was finally pictured landing in Oslo in the early hours of ThursdayThroughout the journey, he added that various steps were taken to mask and disguise Machado's face, as well as her digital profile because she is so well-known.\"The biometric threat is so real,\" he noted, adding steps were taken to make sure she could not be traced via her phone.He said that Machado was \"formidable\" despite the conditions, accepting a jumper for warmth, but not asking for anything else.\"She was soaking wet and freezing cold and didn't complain once,\" he laughed, acknowledging the operation was very dangerous because water is \"unforgiving\".\"If I am driving a boat and blow an engine, I'm swimming to Venezuela.\"When asked how he could guarantee the safety of Venezuelans who helped with the operation, Mr Stern said they kept their identities secret and \"we [Grey Bull] do a lot of deception operations\".Many of those who helped didn't even realise they were working for him, Mr Stern said, while others think they \"know the whole story\", but they really don't.\"There are people who did things that were benign from their perspective - but mission-critical from our perspective.\"Grey Bull Rescue/HandoutBryan Stern's Grey Bull Rescue held missions during Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the US (he is pictured here in Tampa, 2024)He said the operation was financed by donors, and not by the US government: \"We've never had a thank-you note from the US government, let alone a dollar.\"Mr Stern said he did coordinate with some nation states, and with intelligence and diplomatic services of several countries. This included alerting the US in an \"informal\" manner. Machado has said she intends to return to Venezuela, but Mr Stern said he advised her not to do that.\"I told her, 'don't go back. You're a Mum. We need you.' She's going to do what she's going to do... I understand why she wants to go back because she's a hero to her people. \"I wish she wouldn't go back; I have a feeling she will.\"Watch: BBC speaks to Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado",

    "body": "Clair Obscur sweeps The Game Awards with nine wins6 hours agoTom RichardsonBBC NewsbeatClair Obscur sweeps The Game Awards with nine winsClair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been named game of the year in a record-breaking haul at this year's Game Awards.The French-developed role-playing game (RPG) cleaned up in nine of the 10 categories it was up for, with further wins in best narrative, best music and best performance.It fended off competition from Death Stranding 2, Nintendo platformer Donkey Kong Bananza, indie games Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades 2, and medieval adventure Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to claim the top prize.During the ceremony in Los Angeles, players also got their first glimpses of two new Tomb Raider games, sequel Control Resonant and a new Star Wars role-playing game.Clair Obscur is set in a world where a supernatural being known as The Paintress prevents the population from growing past a certain age.The game, which tells the story of a group of adventurers on a quest to destroy The Paintress, was praised for its emotional narrative and use of old-school, turn-based battles. Players were also won over by the story of developer Sandfall Interactive, formed by a group of employees who left gaming giant Ubisoft to make their dream project. Accepting the game of the year award, director Guillaume Broche - wearing a red beret and striped t-shirt in a nod to the game's strong French identity - said the year had been a \"weird timeline\" for the studio as he thanked his team.He also extended thanks to the \"unsung heroes\" of the industry - \"the people who make tutorials on YouTube on how to make a game, because we had no idea how to make one before\".AFP via Getty ImagesClair Obscur: Expedition 33's director Guillaume Broche accepted the game of the year prizeClair Obscur was the hot favourite going into the awards, and the most-nominated game in the ceremony's history with a total of 12 nods.Its composer Lorien Testard won the award for best score and music.It was the debut project for the musician, who was discovered after he posted a collection of homemade video game music to his SoundCloud account.Clair Obscur also romped to victory in the best role-playing game, best independent game and best debut indie game categories.Three of its nominations were in a single category - best performance - and actress Jennifer English claimed the prize over co-stars Charlie Cox and Ben Starr for her role as Maelle.The actress, who has often spoken about having ADHD, dedicated the award \"to every neurodivergent person watching\".Getty ImagesJennifer English has appeared in three game of the year-winning titles, including Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3Clair Obscur only missed out on two awards it was up for.Battlefield 6 won best audio design, while open-world action RPG Wuthering Waves was a surprising winner in the fan-voted Player's Voice category.Best game rival Donkey Kong Bananza won the family game award, and online shooter Arc Raiders won the best multiplayer prize.Sequel Hollow Knight: Silksong was named best action-adventure, while anime-inspired horse racing game Umamusume: Pretty Derby was named best mobile game.And the ceremony's second honorary Game Changer award, first introduced last year, went to Girls Make Games.The non-profit group encourages girls and young women to pursue careers in video games, and runs summer camps to teach programming and design skills. No Game Awards ceremony would be complete without the odd A-lister appearance, and this year was no different.Stranger Things star David Harbour took to the stage to announce a new Total War: Warhammer 40K strategy game, and US singer Lenny Kravitz officially revealed his villainous role in the upcoming James Bond game 007: First Light.Team CherryHollow Knight: Silksong, one of the year's most anticipated games, was named best action-adventureDespite being referred to as the \"Oscars of gaming\", the Game Awards, hosted by its founder Geoff Keighley, is a mixture of traditional ceremony and trailer showcase.Some of the games industry's biggest developers will give the first look at upcoming major titles during the show, and it's thought that this is one of the main reasons many fans tune in.One of the night's biggest announcements was RPG Divinity from Larian Studios, the maker of 2023 game of the year Baldur's Gate 3.The developer had teased the reveal with a mysterious statue which first appeared in the Californian desert.A remake of the original Tomb Raider game had also been leaked, but the announcement of a second, brand new entry starring Lara Croft came as a surprise.Star Wars fans got a glimpse at two new games - Fate of the Old Republic, a long-awaited successor to 2004's beloved Knights of the Old Republic, and Galactic Racer, developed by UK-based studio Fuse Games.  The cast of the new Street Fighter movie adaptation, with the exception of rapper 50 Cent, introduced its first trailer.And fans also saw new footage from the upcoming Resident Evil 9, confirming the appearance of fan-favourite character Leon Kennedy, and PS5 shooter Saros.NintendoOh, banana! Donkey Kong Bananza was named best Family GameThe Game Awards has been criticised in the past for prioritising advertising over awards, with winning speeches being cut short and on-stage presentations being absent in some categories.There was praise of 2024's show for going some way to address criticisms, but developers have continued to call on organiser Geoff Keighley to better acknowledge problems in the industry, such as the high number of job losses in recent years.This year, there have been complaints about the awards abandoning its Future Class scheme - an initiative founded in 2020 to highlight \"rising stars\" in video games.It was last run in 2023, when current and former members of the group signed an open letter urging the awards to address the Israel-Gaza war.In the run-up to this year's nominations, after it was confirmed Future Class would not return, alumni accused the scheme of tokenism and not doing enough to help them build contacts.Last year, the ceremony gave out a new game changer award to Amir Satvat, for his work to help laid-off developers find jobs.BBC Newsbeat has approached organisers for comment.A full list of winners is available on The Game Awards website.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "14 hours agoKelly NgandThanyarat Doksone,BangkokThailand has dissolved parliament after nearly a week of fresh clashes along its border with Cambodia, with a general election to be called within 45 to 60 days.In a royal decree published on Friday, Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul cited the deadly border dispute among other challenges his minority government has struggled to contain since it took office three months ago.\"The appropriate solution is to dissolve parliament… which is a way to return political power to the people,\" he said.Anutin, a business tycoon, is Thailand's third prime minister since August 2023. When he took power in September, he said he would dissolve parliament by the end of January.However, now facing an imminent vote of no confidence, Anutin brought the election forward.Anutin and his Bhumjaithai party were heavily criticised for their handling of serious flooding in southern Thailand last month, which left at least 176 people dead. The house's dissolution comes during renewed fighting with Cambodia, which has killed at least 20 people and displaced hundreds of thousands.\"The government had executed every means in public administration to quickly resolve the urgent issues overwhelming the country… but running the country requires stability,\" Anutin wrote in the decree endorsed by Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn. \"As a minority government, together with troubling domestic political circumstances, it has been unable to carry out public administration continuously, effectively and with stability,\" he wrote.The dissolution order comes after the prime minister lost the support of the youthful, progressive People's Party - also the largest party in parliament - which had previously backed his premiership.The People's Party and the pragmatic, conservative Bhumjaithai are ideological opposites. The opposition bloc's support, however, came with strings attached. It wanted Anutin to start reforms of Thailand's military-drafted constitution and to dissolve the house within four months, among other things.The People's Party has now accused Bhumjaithai of failing to honour that deal. It had planned to submit a no-confidence motion against the government on Friday, according to Thai media - having already called on the prime minister on Thursday to disband parliament to \"show responsibility towards the people\".\"See you at the polling stations,\" the party said in statement on Facebook.Thailand has been in political turmoil over the past year, with two prime ministers dismissed by the courts. Anutin's predecessor Paetongtarn Shinawatra was removed for violating ethics, after she was heard calling Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen \"uncle\" and criticising the Thai army in a leaked phone call.Srettha Thavisin, the leader before her, was also dismissed for violating ethics, by appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who was once jailed.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head in Bangkok",

    "body": "16 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, BangkokandLulu LuoBBC/ Jonathan HeadThe army has been demolishing buildings in KK Park with explosivesThe serenity of a late afternoon on the Moei River that divides Thailand from Myanmar is broken by three thunderous explosions. The ethnic Karen families bathing and playing in the water make a panicked dash for the river bank, as a plume of dark smoke rises from the trees behind them.The conflict ignited by the Myanmar military's coup nearly five years ago has come back to the border.But the fighting this time is linked to the scam compounds, run by Chinese crime syndicates, which have proliferated in Karen State in the past two years.\"We are working to completely eradicate online scam activities from their roots,\" the Myanmar junta's spokesman Gen Zaw Min Tun said.But there are good reasons for scepticism about the military's claims.Not for the first time, Myanmar's long civil war and its scam crisis are entwined.Getty ImagesKK Park workers cross the Moei river from Myanmar to Thailand on 24 October 2025After losing control of large areas of the country to insurgent groups, this year the military junta has counter-attacked, reinforced by new conscripts, and new equipment like drones supplied by Russia and China. In Karen State it has driven back the forces of its main opponent, the Karen National Union, which it has been fighting for eight decades, and which has been one of the staunchest opponents of the coup.Suddenly, at the end of October, the army stormed KK Park, one of the largest and most notorious scam compounds in Karen State, driving out thousands of foreigners who had been running online fraud schemes there, some voluntarily, some after being tricked or trafficked and forced to work. The army posted videos of soldiers confiscating thousands of mobile phones, computers and satellite dishes from Elon Musk's Starlink service. They began demolishing buildings with explosives.This was a striking change of heart. For years, Myanmar's military rulers turned a blind eye to the multi-billion dollar scam business expanding rapidly along its border with Thailand. Local warlords allied to the military have been the principal protectors and business partners of the Chinese scam bosses, and have become very rich. Some of that money went into the coffers of the ruling generals. The junta has tried to blame the KNU for the scams, but there is no basis for this; unlike the other armed Karen groups, the KNU has kept its distance from the business.Tha scam centres accessed the internet via StarlinkBillions of dollars have been lost globally by victims of romance scams, people duped into get-rich-quick crypto schemes and elderly people investing their retirement money into bogus funds, many of which originate from these centres. The darkest side of the industry is felt in South East Asia, where these online fraud schemes are linked to human trafficking, money laundering and extensive human rights abuses.There is growing international concern, and co-ordination between law-enforcement agencies, to try to combat this scourge. The US has set up a multi-agency anti-scam task force. China, one of the Myanmar military junta's closest allies, has been pressing it to do more for years because thousands of Chinese citizens have fallen victim both to online fraud and to being trafficked and held for ransom in the compounds.From the reports in Myanmar state media showcasing the military's actions in KK Park, it would appear that this pressure is finally working.And yet its demolitions in KK Park, while spectacular, do not appear to have destroyed the infrastructure for scamming there. And the military operations have focused only on this compound – there are dozens of others. It did raid the scam city of Shwe Kokko, but only entered a few buildings, and to date has demolished only one.BBC/ Jonathan HeadSome buildings in KK park looked heavily damagedThousands of foreign scam workers have left KK Park and Shwe Kokko, and made their way across the Moei River to Thailand. Many others have scattered to different locations, although transport is difficult and expensive. Just booking a car now costs 5,000 yuan, equivalent to about $700 (£520). The main scam bosses are presumed to have taken their businesses to more remote, less visible parts of Myanmar further south on the border.But in a town called Minletpan, one group of scam workers was trapped last month in two compounds, known as Shunda and Baoili. These have been built right by the river just in the past two years. They are in an area controlled by the DKBA, one of the militias allied to the military junta.On 21 November, according to a KNU spokesman, their fighters were engaged in a battle with the army, when they found themselves being shot at from behind by the DKBA in Minletpan. They turned and drove out the DKBA, but then found themselves unexpectedly in control of the two scam centres, and the thousands of foreigners working there.The KNU announced that it wanted to set an example by inviting journalists and international law enforcement agencies to see the captured compounds. It published photographs and documents to expose how the scam business works, rather than destroying the evidence as the military has done in KK Park.It sent hundreds of workers over the river to Thailand, but around 1,000, mainly Chinese citizens, refused to leave, probably because they feared prosecution if they went back to China.But aside from a handful of journalists, the international interest in its prize never materialised, and the junta's forces began shelling the area to try to retake the compounds – that's what we could hear from the Thai side. Many of the remaining scam workers have now fled elsewhere in Myanmar, though a few hundred remain camped under flimsy tarpaulins on the river bank, along with hundreds of local people, all hoping to avoid the artillery exchanges.BBC/ Jonathan HeadDust rises above KK Park as buildings were demolishedAll this drama is down to one thing: the junta's much criticised plan to hold an election later this month. The civil war ignited by its coup is ravaging the country. The military regime is loathed by most of Myanmar's people, and is treated as a pariah internationally.The generals are looking for an off-ramp which will buy them a semblance of legitimacy, and win over some of their many opponents. They have chosen an election, but one in which the main opposition groups either cannot or will not take part, and where much of the country is in too much turmoil for voting to take place at all.So the military has made retaking as much territory from insurgents before the election a priority. It is also trying to clean up its image, by its high-profile operation against the scam compounds. This is especially important for its most powerful international ally, China.While we were on the border, we saw clouds of dust rising above KK Park as more buildings were demolished. Some of the largest structures there were buckled and bent, their windows shattered; the walls of others were being torn down by excavators.But in the distance many buildings were still intact. Some had tell-tale white squares on their roofs that were almost certainly Starlink satellite dishes, suggesting some scam work might still be going on there.A warning against scammers is displayed at a Thai-Myanmar border crossingDrive an hour-and-half south in Thailand, and you reach a quiet border crossing called Wa Le – Wawlay in Burmese. The river is so narrow here it is little more than a stream; you walk over to Myanmar through an iron gate and across a little blue wooden bridge, where you are greeted by the flags of the KNU.But while the territory around Wawlay is fiercely contested, with the KNU capturing several military bases earlier this year, the crossing is controlled by the DKBA.On the Thai side large signs warn people of the risks of being lured into working for scam centres. Yet just a few metres away a walled compound, topped with razor wire, has been built right next to the river. This is known as Hengsheng 3; we could hear generators running and security guards talking on the other side of the wall.There were barred windows, and Starlink dishes on the roof. Monitoring groups have identified this and several other new compounds around Wawlay. Many more syndicates have moved even further south to Payathonzu, near the Three Pagodas Pass border crossing.Whatever the future of well-known scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko – and it is too soon to judge whether they really are being shut down – the scam business is still thriving in Myanmar.Read more about Myanmar's scam compounds",

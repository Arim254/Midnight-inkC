    "body": "15 hours agoWill GrantCentral America and Cuba correspondentMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. In the video, a man approaches her from behind and attempts to kiss her on the neck and place his hands on her body. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken. The offender has been arrested.\"My view is, if I don't file a complaint, what will happen to other Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what will happen to all women in our country?\" Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday.\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" she said. \"I have experienced it before, when I wasn't president, when I was a student.\"She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.\"A line must be drawn,\" she said.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman. Femicide is also a huge problem in Mexico, with a staggering 98% of gender-based murders estimated to go unpunished.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events. On occasion, that has presented security concerns for her team. However, she confirmed in her new conference she had no intention of changing her policy of interacting with her supporters.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels. Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.Since taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump.",

    "body": "Attackers have boarded a ship off the coast of Somalia after firing machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades at the vessel, according to a UK maritime agency.Greek shipping company Latsco Marine Management confirmed the attack on a ship carrying gasoline, saying all the ship's 24 crew were \"safe and accounted for\" and \"we remain in close contact with them\".The crew have taken shelter in the ship's fortified safe room, Reuters news agency quotes an official from maritime security company Diaplous as saying. European Union naval forces operating in the area have been asked for assistance, Reuters says.The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) says the raid happened about 560 nautical miles south-east of the Somali town of Eyl. \"The Master of a vessel has reported being approached by one small craft on its stern. The small craft fired small arms and RPGs towards the vessel,\" UKMTO said in a statement.Private security firm Ambrey said the attackers were probably Somali pirates, who have been active in the region in recent days.According to Latsco, the attack on the Malta-registered vessel occurred at around 11:48 local time (08:48GMT). \"[Latsco] has activated its emergency response team and is coordinating with the relevant authorities to ensure the continued safety and welfare of the crew,\" it said.The vessel, named Hellas Aphrodite, was built in 2016, and was en route from Sikka, India, to Durban, South Africa, it saidThe attack comes amid a resurgence of piracy in the region, which had declined after peaking more than a decade ago.There were at least seven reported incidents last year, and several fishing vessels have already been seized by pirates this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau.",

    "body": "25 minutes agoBethany Bell,Vienna and Yogita Limaye,South Asia and Afghanistan correspondentOpium farming in Afghanistan has dropped significantly following a ban imposed by the Taliban government in 2022, the United Nations said.The total area of land for growing opium poppy shrank 20% since last year, while the amount of opium has fallen by 32% over the same period, the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime said in a survey.Afghanistan used to produce more than 80% of the world's opium, with heroin made from Afghan opium making up 95% of the market in Europe.But after retaking power the Taliban banned the practice in April 2022, saying opium was harmful and went against their religious beliefs. The UN said most farmers continued to observe the ban despite \"severe economic challenges\".Many Afghan farmers are harvesting cereals, but poppy - from which opium, the key ingredient for the drug heroin can be extracted - continues to be \"far more profitable\" than legitimate crops, the UNODC noted.Over 40% of available farmland has remained fallow because of the lack of profitable alternatives, limited agricultural outputs and, adverse climate conditions it added.The total area under opium poppy cultivation this year was estimated at 10,200 hectares, mostly in the north-east of the country, with Badakhshan province accounting for the largest share. Before the 2022 ban, more than 200,000 hectares were under poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. Four provinces with opium poppy cultivation in 2024 (Balkh, Farah, Laghman, Uruzgan) were declared opium poppy-free in 2025. \"The near elimination of cultivation from traditional strongholds illustrates the scale and durability of the ban on opium poppy cultivation,\" the survey said.The Taliban's efforts to destroy opium fields occasionally sparked violent resistance from the farmers, particularly in the north-east, the UNODC said, noting that casualties were reported during clashes in several districts of Badakhshan.But the vast majority of Afghan farmers adhere to the ban issued by the Taliban's supreme leader. However, farmers say they lack support to grow alternative crops - as a result, they have to choose between poverty or punishment.\"If we violate the ban, we face prison. If we comply, we face destitution,\" one unnamed farmer in Helmand province told BBC Pashto this summer.\"If there's no money, then I'll grow poppies again.\"Poppy fields are no longer openly visible in Helmand, but they do still exist.Another farmer showed BBC Pashto around his small walled-off poppy field in front of his house in a remote village. He's risking jail, but he said he had no option.\"What should I do? I'm forced to do this - I have nothing else. I can't even provide food for my family.\"While opium is in decline, trafficking in synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine have risen since the ban, the UNODC said. Seizures of such drugs in and around Afghanistan was 50% higher in late 2024 compared with the previous year. Organised crime groups favour synthetic drugs which are easier to produce and less vulnerable to climate shocks, the UNODC said.",

    "body": "German nurse gets life in jail after murdering 10 to reduce workload10 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesA palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of the murder of 10 patients and the attempted murder of 27 others.Prosecutors alleged that the man, who has not been publicly named, injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives in an effort to ease his workload during shifts overnight.The offences were committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, in western Germany. Investigators are reported to be looking into several other suspicious cases during his career.According to media outlet Agence France-Presse (AFP), the unnamed man had been employed at the hospital in Wuerselen since 2020, after completing training as a nursing professional in 2007. Prosecutors told a court in Aachen that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\". The court was told that he injected patients with large doses of morphine and midazolam, a type of sedative, in an effort to reduce his workload during night shifts.He was arrested in 2024.When issuing the life sentence, the court said that the man's crimes carried a \"particular severity of guilt\" which should bar him from early release after 15 years.He will be able to appeal the verdict.Prosecutors have told AFP that exhumations are taking place to identify further potential victims, which could see the man put on trial again.The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany. A court found that he administered lethal doses of heart medication to people in his care between 1999 and 2005.He is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.",

    "body": "17 hours agoAndrew HardingParis correspondentReutersFrench police have launched an investigation into sex-trafficking linked to the disgraced businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who died two years ago.The police investigation, ordered by the Paris prosecutor's office, will focus on \"potential acts of aggravated human trafficking… with multiple victims,\" according to correspondence seen by the BBC. Prostitution and one case of rape are also being investigated.Al Fayed's Ritz Hotel in Paris will likely be a target of the investigation, amid claims from victims that staff knew about or facilitated the abuse of women.In a statement, the Ritz said it was \"deeply alarmed\" by the allegations of abuse and it would cooperate \"fully\" with authorities.The trafficking investigation marks a new twist in a series of legal battles linked to Al Fayed's violent crimes and to the search – both before and since his death – for some sort of justice for his many victims.An American woman, Pelham Spong, 40, played a key role in triggering this investigation in France, where it is alleged that Al Fayed moved young female staff from the Ritz to his private house in Paris and to various yachts and family homes on the Mediterranean coast.Ms Spong was living in Paris in 2008 when she applied for a job working as a personal assistant for the Al Fayed family in Monaco. She was brought to London several times, subjected to an intrusive gynaecological examination, and then – she alleges - sexually assaulted by Al Fayed in his office on Park Lane.\"He told me the job entailed sleeping with him,\" Ms Spong said, adding that she declined the offer on the spot.\"I didn't realise I was a victim of sex trafficking until this past year when I… saw the scale and scope of the abuse and realised that it was a pattern and a system and a machine,\" she told the BBC in an interview in Paris.Pelham Spong was 23 years old when she first applied to work for Al Fayed's familyA few months ago, Ms Spong, now living back in the USA, came to Paris to report her experiences to the French police, hoping that it might persuade other women to come forward with evidence of their own abuse.\"It's a big step that the prosecutors decided to open an investigation. [Ms Spong] has a really good case because she kept a lot of materials. It will be very strong,\" her lawyer, Anne-Claire Le Jeune told the BBC.Ms Spong said it is \"so much easier to dismiss the actions of an evil man that's dead\". \"And you can't learn anything from that as a society. So how do you prevent this happening again? \"Well, first, you have to name what it... It's critical to call it what it is, trafficking, so that we can prevent it,\" she said.Ms Spong's lawyer, Anne-Claire Le Jeune, says her client has a \"very strong\" caseAl Fayed is also being investigated in the UK, where more than 140 people have reported him to the Met Police.The extent of Al Fayed's predatory behaviour was first brought to light by a BBC documentary and podcast, broadcast in September 2024.Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-Harrods employees who said Al Fayed sexually assaulted or raped them. Since then, dozens more women have come forward with similar experiences.After the broadcast, the Met revealed it had been approached by 21 women before Al Fayed's death, who accused him of sexual offences including rape, sexual assault and trafficking. Despite this, he was never charged with any offences.Ms Spong herself says she spoke to British police about Al Fayed in 2017 but was told he was too ill to be questioned.Earlier this year, the Met wrote to alleged victims apologising, saying it was \"truly sorry\" for the distress they have suffered because Al Fayed will never face justice. The force is currently investigating its handling of historical allegations against Al Fayed and looking into whether others could face charges for enabling his behaviour.Harrods has set aside more than £60m in its plan to compensate alleged victims of Al Fayed's abuse. In a statement announcing the scheme, Harrods said: \"While we cannot undo the past, we have been determined to do the right thing as an organisation, driven by the values we hold today, while ensuring that such behaviour can never be repeated in the future.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoMeryl Sebastian & Devina Gupta,BBC News and Abhishek Dey,BBC News, DelhiElection Commission of IndiaVoters are casting their ballots for 243 seats in a two-phase election to choose the next state governmentBrisk voting is being reported in the eastern Indian state of Bihar where more than 74 million people are eligible to vote in a crucial election that will be a precursor to several key state polls.Voters are casting their ballots for 243 seats in a two-phase election to choose the next state government. Counting of votes is scheduled for 14 November.The election comes after a controversial revision of electoral rolls that the opposition alleged would exclude genuine voters and give an edge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The BJP and India's Election Commission have denied these allegations.Long queues were witnessed through the day outside the polling stations in all the 18 districts where voting was being held on Thursday. The second and final day of voting would be 11 November.In hundreds of polling booths, people could be seen arriving in electric three-wheelers arranged by the district administration, especially for the elderly and persons with disabilities.In Alipur district, a 70-year-old woman was carried on a cot to a polling centre by her family members. When reporters asked her for comments, she could hardly speak. Her relatives said she was unwell but still wanted to make sure that her vote counted.Some polling stations were decorated with balloons and makeshift tents were arranged outside for voters to rest while they waited for their turn.At many centres in Siwan, Darbhaga and Begusarai districts, voters could be seen clicking photos at selfie points set up by the local booth officials.At 16:00 local time [07:30GMT], the voter turnout was recorded by the Election Commission at 53.77%.Election Commission of IndiaLong queues were seen outside most polling stations on ThursdayBihar is one of India's poorest and most populous states, which sees millions migrating to other states for jobs. It is also among the few states in India where Modi's party has not managed to form a government yet on its own.The outgoing government is an alliance between the BJP and the Janata Dal (United), or JD(U). They are contesting the elections again together while India's main opposition Congress party has tied up with the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and a number of smaller parties.The election has also seen the entry of a new political party led by Prashant Kishor, a former political consultant who has in the past worked with both the BJP and the Congress.The election is also being closely watched as it might be the last to see active participation from two leaders who have shaped Bihar's politics for almost four decades - JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar and RJD's Lalu Prasad Yadav. The rivals, who are said to be in poor health, have on occasion joined hands to stay in power.Incumbent chief minister Kumar is one of the state's most influential leaders and has led the government for a major part of the past two decades.He is a key ally of the BJP and played a crucial role in helping Modi's party form the federal government after the 2024 election. Election Commission of IndiaBihar is one of India's poorest and most populous statesRJD's Lalu Yadav served as chief minister from 1990-97. Known for his colourful personality and witty one-liners, Yadav's rise as a politician who championed marginalised caste groups transformed the political landscape of the state. His party's years in power, however, became associated with misrule and corruption. He is currently out on bail after being convicted in corruption cases.Yadav's son Tejashwi has been projected as the chief minister candidate for the opposition alliance.The election comes on the back of a controversial voter list revision carried out by India's Election Commission a few months ago. The commission released a list of 74.2 million voters in September, weeding out 4.7 million names.The exercise was sharply criticised by the opposition, which accused the commission of dropping many voters - especially Muslims - to aid Modi's party. Both the BJP and the Election Commission denied this.New voters list in Indian state includes wrong photos and dead peopleAnalysts say female voters are expected to play a key role in these elections - nearly half of the voters are women and their turnout has seen a steady rise.Political analyst Santosh Singh says women in Bihar are more likely to vote over issues and that's why political parties are trying to target them with different welfare schemes. Both alliances have offered financial assistance to woo women voters.Earlier this week, the BBC met Kushboo Devi, 40, who's been campaigning for her local candidate in Masaurhi village. She says she has been trying to get everyone to come out and vote, but her focus is on women. \"Because in Bihar, wherever you see a higher voting percentage, it's usually the women who are showing up at the poll booths.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoIan AikmanWatch: Miss Universe contestants walk out of briefing after organiser calls Miss Mexico 'dumbhead'.Several contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation. At a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.Video of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online. The Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has condemned Mr Nawat's \"malicious\" behaviour, for which he has since apologised.The Miss Universe contestants, who are the winners of national pageants in their home countries, attended Tuesday's event in their sashes and gowns.Some can be heard shouting back at Mr Nawat in the video, after he raises his voice to reprimand Ms Bosch and repeatedly tells her to stop talking. As many of them stand to show support, Mr Nawat says: \"If anyone wants to continue the contest, sit down. If you step out, the rest of the girls continue.\"Despite this, the majority of the women in the video appear standing, with several heading towards the door.After leaving the event on Tuesday, Ms Bosch told the press the 60-year-old executive was \"not respectful\" and said he had called her \"dumb\". Mr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood. He is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying she had caused \"damage\".His conduct prompted a stern rebuke from the MUO, which has sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.In a video statement, MUO President Raul Rocha said Mr Nawat had \"forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\". He said the Thai official had \"humiliated, insulted and showed a lack of respect\" to Ms Bosch, and committed the \"serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenceless woman\".Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited \"as much as possible\" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking \"legal actions\" against him.\"I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,\" Mr Rocha said.RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA/ShutterstockFatima Bosch said Nawat Itsaragrisil was \"not respectful\" at the pre-pageant ceremony on TuesdayAmong those to walk out on Tuesday was reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. \"This is about women's rights,\" she said as she left the event. \"This is not how things should be handled. To trash another girl is beyond disrespectful... That's why I'm taking my coat and I'm walking out.\"Ms Bosch later said in an interview: \"I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard. It's here stronger than ever. I have a purpose. I have things to say.\"We're in the 21st century. I'm not a doll to be made up, styled and have my clothes changed,\" she added. \"I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I'm completely committed to that.\"Video of Mr Nawat has outraged fans of the pageant, with many heavily criticising his actions and praising Ms Bosch's response.In a social media video statement, Mr Nawat said: \"If anyone feels bad, uncomfortable, or affected, I apologise to everyone. I especially apologised to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.\"The Miss Universe competition has pressed on despite this controversy, with contestants taking part in a welcome event in Bangkok on Wednesday.The winner will be crowned the new Miss Universe on 21 November.RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA/ShutterstockThai businessman and media personality Nawat Itsaragrisil has apologised for the incident",

    "body": "2 hours agoRuth Comerford and Farouk ChothiaSouth Africa's government says it has received distress calls from 17 citizens who have joined mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The men are between the ages of 20 and 39 years and are trapped in Ukraine's war-torn Donbas region.President Cyril Ramaphosa has \"ordered an investigation into the circumstances that led to the recruitment of these young men into these seemingly mercenary activities,\" a government spokesman said. The statement did not say which side of the conflict the South Africans were fighting for.Working as a mercenary or fighting on behalf of another government is illegal in South Africa, unless the government authorises it.The men were lured to join the mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative contracts, the government said. Spokesman Vincent Magwenya added the South African government is working through \"diplomatic channels\" to secure their return.Magwenya said 16 of the men were from KwaZulu-Natal and one from the Eastern Cape.\"President Ramaphosa and the South African government strongly condemn the exploitation of young vulnerable people by individuals working with foreign military entities,\" he added. South Africa has an unemployment rate of more than 30%, and is even higher among young people, making them vulnerable for recruitment, analysts say. The BBC has found evidence to suggest the Kremlin is working to expand its sphere of influence in Africa.Africa Corps, a Russian mercenary group controlled by the Russian Ministry of Defence, has effectively replaced the rival military group Wagner in West Africa, after its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash.In August, the South African government issued a warning to young women not to fall for social media recruitment opportunities promoting jobs abroad, particularly in Russia.A BBC investigation found young women had been taken to the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in the Republic of Tatarstan in Russia to work in a drones factory. It is estimated more than 1,000 women have been recruited from across Africa and South Asia to work in Alabuga's weapons factories. In September, Kenyan police said they had rescued more than 20 people from a suspected trafficking ring that had lured them with job offers in Russia but intended to send them to fight in Ukraine.Ukraine has previously said that it was holding citizens of various countries - Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka - at prisoner-of-war camps.Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side. In 2022, Senegal's foreign ministry said it had summoned Kyiv's ambassador to demand the withdrawal of an embassy post on Facebook urging foreigners to enlist for its war effort. At the time, Nigeria also warned that it would not tolerate Ukraine's recruitment drive, forcing it to back-pedal.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLana LamSydneyPeter MumbyThe Great Barrier Reef has suffered mass bleaching events in recent yearsThe Great Barrier Reef is headed for a \"grim future\" and will suffer a \"rapid coral decline\" by 2050 but parts may recover if global warming is kept below 2C, a new study has found.Researchers at the University of Queensland (UQ) used modelling to simulate the lifecycles of certain coral species and found that some were better at adapting to warmer oceans and could help new coral grow.Reefs near cooler-water currents were also more resilient, giving a \"glimmer of hope\" to the natural wonder, which has suffered severe climate-induced heat stress in recent years.The study warned that curbing carbon emissions was crucial to allow coral to recover and avoid a \"near collapse\" of the reef.Dr Yves-Marie Bozec, who led the research, said the modelling of more than 3,800 individual reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef looked at their \"eco-evolutionary dynamics\". This included how corals interact with each other, how they deal with warmer water and corals in naturally cooler areas.\"We ran all of those factors with the most up-to-date climate projections - and the news was not good,\" he said.\"We forecast a rapid coral decline before the middle of this century regardless of the emissions scenario.\"The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems, stretching more than 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Australia's north-east coast.It has suffered four significant marine heatwaves between 2016 and 2022, causing much of its coral to expel the algae which gives them life and colour - a process called bleaching, which is often fatal.A recent report found that parts of the Great Barrier Reef had suffered the largest annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly 40 years ago.Dr Bozec said some parts of the reef \"may partially recover after 2050, but only if ocean warming is sufficiently slow to allow natural adaptation to keep pace with temperature changes\".\"Adaptation may keep pace if global warming does not exceed two degrees by 2100. For that to happen, more action is needed globally to reduce carbon emissions which are driving climate change.\"Dr Bozec said: \"The window for meaningful action is closing rapidly but it hasn't shut\".Under the Paris agreement, almost 200 nations have pledged to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and to keep them \"well below\" 2C above those recorded in pre-industrial times, generally considered to mean the late 19th Century.Prof Peter Mumby, who also worked on the study, said they found \"many reefs could persist under the Paris agreement target of two degrees of warming\".\"However, higher emissions leading to faster temperature rises would drive most reefs to a near collapse,\" he said. Prof Murphy said reefs in areas \"where the water doesn't heat up so dramatically because it is well mixed, fared better than others\" and reefs close to populations of corals that can regenerate were also healthier.Identifying areas of the reef network that are more resilient will mean efforts to protect the reef can focus on \"strategic parts\" of the ecosystem, he added.Watch: Can you un-bleach coral?

    "body": "Watch: \"There will be frustration\" - Transport secretary outlines reduction in air trafficUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned that air travel capacity will be cut by up to 10% at 40 major airports over the coming days, if the government shutdown continues.The decision, which is expected to affect domestic flights only, was made because air traffic controllers had been reporting fatigue, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said at a briefing alongside Duffy.Some 1.4 million federal workers, from air traffic controllers to park wardens, are working without pay - or are on forced leave - because the US Congress has not agreed a federal funding budget.Unions say many employees are becoming ill with stress or are being forced into taking second jobs.On Wednesday, the impasse became the longest shutdown in US history.\"It is unusual,\" said FAA chief Bryan Bedford of the planned flight reductions, \"just as the shutdown is unusual, just as the fact that our controllers haven't been paid for a month is unusual\".The flight reductions will be gradual, starting at 4% of domestic flights on Friday, then rising to 5% on Saturday and 6% on Sunday, before hitting the full 10% next week, the Reuters news agency reported, citing four unnamed sources. The names of the affected airports - all high-traffic locations - would be released on Thursday, the officials said.US media including the BBC's partner CBS News reported that the list would include some of the nation's busiest hubs, including Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Dallas/Fort Worth International, Denver International, Chicago O'Hare International and Los Angeles International. The cancellations could affect between 3,500 and 4,000 flights per day. US media also reported that international flights would not be affected.\"We are seeing pressures build in a way that we don't feel - if we allow it to go unchecked - will allow us to continue to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world,\" Bedford said during Wednesday's briefing.Duffy insisted that air travel was still safe, and the decision to cancel the flights was being made to maintain safety and efficiency. If the shutdown continued and added more pressure to the system, additional restrictive measures may be required, Bedford said. In a statement, American Airlines, the second-largest carrier in North America, said it was awaiting additional information from the FAA so it could determine which flights will be scrapped, but that \"we expect the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected\".A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines, another major carrier, said in a statement that the company was still evaluating how the flight restrictions would affect its services, and that it would let customers know as soon as possible. \"We continue to urge Congress to immediately resolve its impasse and restore the National Airspace System to its full capacity,\" the spokesperson added.Delta Airlines declined to comment. The BBC has also asked for comment from other major US airlines. Once government funds ran out on 1 October, most federal workers were sent home and told they would be paid once the government reopened. Those deemed essential, like controllers, though, had to keep doing their jobs without pay.Almost immediately after the shutdown started, airports began feeling the effects. Some had to ground flights for hours after air traffic controllers called out sick, while others relied on controllers from other airports.Duffy warned earlier this week that the flight cancellations could be coming, as half of the country's 30 major airports experienced staff shortages. Nick Daniels, the president of the labour union representing more than 20,000 aviation workers, put the situation into stark terms on Wednesday. \"Air traffic controllers are texting 'I don't even have enough money to put gas in my car to come to work,'\" he told CNN.\"We base what we do day in and day out on predictability,\" he said. \"Right now there is no predictability.\"Speaking to NPR, one controller suggested that the situation might be reaching \"tipping point\" for them and their colleagues. \"This is kind of about the point in the last shutdown where people just started getting fed up with it,\" they said.Another controller told the same broadcaster: \"It does degrade that margin of safety if a bunch of people are sick and not at work and I'm having to do their jobs along with my own.\"Writing recently for MSNBC, another controller, a single father, said he was working for food delivery service DoorDash after his daily air traffic shift ended, and was \"sleeping only two hours most nights\". \"Like many families, we didn't plan for a shutdown,\" he wrote. \"Yet the bills don't stop.\"Duffy previously said there was a risk that came with air traffic controllers taking on additional jobs during the shutdown, and had threatened to fire controllers who did not come to work.\"They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheque and not put food on the table? Or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables?\" Duffy said on Sunday. ",

    "body": "22 hours agoMadeline HalpertNew York CityWatch: Joy precedes scrutiny, reports Nada Tawfik from inside Mamdani's victory partyZohran Mamdani, 34, has won New York City's race for mayor in a contest that rallied young voters and sparked debate about the future direction of the US Democratic Party.Ugandan-born Mamdani, a Democrat, beat former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, to become the youngest person in over a century to lead the largest city in the US.\"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" the self-described democratic socialist told the crowd during a victory speech.Democrats also won governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in California voters backed a proposition to redraw the congressional electoral map ahead of next year's midterm elections. Mamdani made affordability the central message of his campaign, pledging to expand social programmes paid for by new taxes on high earners and corporations.In New York, he was a relatively unknown member of the state assembly until his campaign gained online momentum a few months ago, propelling him to victory in the Democratic primary contest over the summer.Mamdani has become the first South Asian and Muslim to lead the city. In his victory speech, he spoke of a \"new age\".\"For as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well-connected that power does not belong in their hands,\" Mamdani said. \"The future is in our hands,\" he said, pledging to create a government that works \"for everyone\".Mamdani's campaign has drawn significant national attention, including from US President Donald Trump, who in the days before the vote threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if Mamdani won. The president calls Mamdani a communist - a label that Mamdani rejects.In overnight projections from BBC news partner CBS, Mamdani had secured 50.3% of the vote, compared with Cuomo's 41.6%. Republican Curtis Sliwa had just over 7%. Shortly after the winner was projected, Sliwa conceded.\"We have a mayor-elect,\" Sliwa told a group of supporters. \"Obviously I wish him good luck, because if he does well, we do well.\"Cuomo also conceded, congratulating Mamdani despite a chorus of boos from his supporters. But Cuomo highlighted that almost half of New Yorkers who voted had not picked Mamdani, and said his opponent had made \"promises that cannot be met\".There are questions over how Mamdani will pay for his ambitious social agenda and critics have questioned how a politician with no executive experience will handle a hostile Trump administration.On Tuesday night, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson criticised the \"consequences\" of New York City's choice on social media platform X. \"Zohran Mamdani's election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party,\" he wrote.The president also posted on social media, blaming the shutdown, and his not appearing on the ballot, for Republican losses Tuesday night. Wins for other Jay Jones and other DemocratsCentrist Democrats clinched victories in elections for governor on Tuesday night, with Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill winning races to run the states of Virginia and New Jersey respectively.The races were being viewed as an indication of how Americans were feeling about the national government's policies, although the latter state is reliably blue.In another closely watched contest in Virginia, Democratic candidate Jay Jones won the race for state attorney general, defeating incumbent Republican candidate Jason Miyares. That was despite a scandal over his historical text messages that wished violence against a political rival, for which Jones apologised.Voters in California also approved a measure to redraw political lines to favour Democrats, in response to similar efforts by conservative-led states in a nationwide battle for control of the US House of Representatives.The redistricting measure, called Prop 50, was aimed at reconfiguring the state's voting districts to give Democrats better chances at taking five seats in the US House of Representatives from Republicans during next year's midterm elections.Whether the measure will tip the balance of power in Washington remains unclear.Questions for national Democratic PartyMamdani's win in New York presents a dilemma for the Democratic establishment, which has been reluctant to endorse him. Mamdani was nonetheless favoured to win his race, having led his rivals in the polls by double digits for weeks leading up to election day. A relatively unknown figure just months ago, few could have predicted his journey from hip-hop artist and housing counsellor to the frontrunner candidate to lead a city with a $116bn (£88bn) budget and global scrutiny.The former New York assemblyman centred his campaign on cost-of-living issues in one of the country's most expensive cities, campaigning on issues like universal child care, and free and faster buses. His candidacy drew criticism from business leaders and centrist Democrats, some of whom did not endorse him, including fellow New Yorker and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans have seized on Mamdani's popularity to paint the future of the Democratic Party as more and more left-leaning - a point that Trump has made during his threats to withhold federal funding to the New York City.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBethany BellForeign correspondent, ViennaAbout 50 vehicles have been smeared with what appears to be human blood in the German city of Hanau near Frankfurt, police say.Cars, walls and postboxes were defaced, sometimes with swastikas, they said in a statement.Police say they were alerted late on Wednesday night when a man noticed that a car in the Lamboy district of Hanau had been smeared with a reddish liquid.The liquid had been applied in the shape of a swastika, they added. Officers then found many other smeared cars and house walls in the surrounding area.Swastikas are banned in Germany under laws banning the public display of Nazi symbols.Police say preliminary tests show the liquid was probably human blood.\"There is still no clue as to where it came from; officials are not yet aware of any injuries in connection with the incident,\" they added.Local authorities said they were trying \"to solve the mystery\" and have appealed to the public for information.Bundestag Vice President Omid Nouripour said the attack left him speechless and needed to be solved quickly.\"This act strikes at the very heart of Hanau and reopens the wounds of the far-right terrorist attack five years ago,\" he wrote on X, referring to the killing of nine people by a gunman targeting people of immigrant origin in February 2020.

    "body": "At least 12 people were killed after a UPS cargo plane crashed during take off from an airport in Louisville, Kentucky on Tuesday evening, the state's governor said.Andy Beshear said the death toll is expected to rise and likely includes at least one child after the freight plane exploded as it departed Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport at around 17:15 local time (22:15 GMT), he said.The left engine caught fire and fell from the wing during takeoff, causing a major fire that sent thick plumes of smoke into the air, the National Transportation and Safety Board said.More than a dozen others were injured in the crash, from burns and shrapnel injuries to smoke inhalation.Officials said those who survived had suffered \"very significant\" injuries in the incident. Crews were still searching for other victims, as multiple people remain unaccounted for. The plane's three-member crew are thought to be among the dead, Beshear has said.A preliminary investigation is under way but officials have said it is too early to say what caused the crash, though surveillance footage and data from the plane is helping piece it together.Investigators have recovered the cockpit flight recorder and the flight data recorder,  known as the black box, said Todd Inman with the NTSB, the agency leading the investigation. In an update on Wednesday, Inman said that CCTV surveillance footage showed the left engine of the aircraft \"detaching from the wing during the takeoff roll\". The video has not yet been released.He said the plane was able to lift off the ground and cleared a fence at the end of the runway before it hit multiple businesses surrounding the airport. Beshear declared a state of emergency on Wednesday to help \"move resources more quickly through emergency management and the Kentucky National Guard\".Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that the airport has since reopened its runway so that flights can resume. At least 16 different families have reported loved ones unaccounted for, according to Beshear. Two workers at the auto business that was struck were still unaccounted for as of Tuesday evening, and it is not known how many customers were on the premises when the crash happened. In a statement, UPS said three crew members were on board, adding \"we have not confirmed any injuries/casualties\".Local officials said on Wednesday that they were unsure how many victims they were searching for, and that the fire destroyed the plane, creating a large debris zone that would make it challenging to find people. Kentucky Representative Morgan McGarvey said 28 people from the NTSB were on the ground and would \"analyse absolutely every bit of what happened\". Officials did note, though, that the massive blaze was caused by the amount of fuel onboard the aircraft, which was beginning a journey of around 4,300 miles (6,920km) to Hawaii.It was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel when it crashed.This made it look like it was \"raining oil\" in Louisville when the crash occurred, McGarvey said. It has not been confirmed what cargo was on board, though officials have said the plane was not carrying anything that would create a heightened risk of contamination.The explosion engulfed at least two nearby businesses, including a petroleum recycling company. A shelter-in-place order was initially issued for within five miles of the airport due to concerns of further explosions and air pollution, but was later reduced to just one mile.All departing flights for Tuesday evening were cancelled, the airport said in a statement on X.Louisville Fire Department Chief Brian O'Neal said the amount of fuel spilled at the crash site made it a \"very dangerous situation\".The shelter-in-place order was reduced to a one-mile radius as crews worked to contain the blaze on Tuesday night.At a press conference, Beshear warned people not to go to the crash site.\"Anyone who has seen the images and the video knows how violent this crash is,\" he said.\"There are still dangerous things that are flammable, that are potentially explosive.\"Louisville Metro Police Dept Chief Paul Humphrey said that the crash site will be \"an ongoing active scene for the next several days\".He added: \"We don't know how long it's going to take to render that scene safe for the investigation to take place.\"The model of aircraft involved was a MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.The aircraft was originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997.In 2023, FedEx and UPS both announced plans to begin retiring their fleets of MD-11s over the next decade as part of plans to modernise their fleets.In a statement, Boeing said it is \"ready to support our customer\" and that \"our concern is for the safety and well-being of all those affected.\"It added that it will offer technical assistance to the NTSB. Louisville is home to UPS Worldport, a global hub for the delivery firm's air cargo operations and its largest package handling facility in the world.In a statement, UPS said it was \"terribly saddened\" by the incident and would be halting package sorting operations at Worldport on Tuesday night.It added: \"UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, and customers and the communities we serve. This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers.\"If you are in the US and have been affected by this story you can get in touch here",

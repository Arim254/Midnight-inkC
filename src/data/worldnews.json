    "body": "58 minutes agoNadine YousifWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromOne of the two members of the National Guard who were shot in Washington DC on Wednesday has died, US President Donald Trump said.Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries while the second National Guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, \"is fighting for his life\", Trump said on Thursday evening.Both were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown DC just after 14:00 EST (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Police have arrested one suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old from Afghanistan.On Friday, the US attorney for Washington DC announced the initial charges of assault against the suspect will be upgraded to \"murder in the first degree\".\"It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn't know what was coming,\" Jeanine Pirro told Fox and Friends. \"And that is the homicide, and that is the murder that we're looking at right now.\"The two soldiers who were attacked had been deployed to the American capital as part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on what it sees as rampant crime in several US cities.Trump confirmed Ms Beckstrom's death while on a Thanksgiving call with US service members. \"Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we're talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person... She's just passed away. She's no longer with us,\" he said. Trump later spoke to her parents, a White House official told BBC's US partner CBS News.The US president previously said the attack underlined a major national security threat. The attack has prompted a range of announcements from the Trump administration aimed at curbing migration from Afghanistan and a number of other countries.Officials said they would suspend processing all immigration requests from Afghans, and re-examine green cards issued to individuals who migrated to the US from 19 countries.When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.On Thursday, Trump went on to vow to \"permanently pause migration\" to the US from all \"third world countries\", without providing details of his plan or naming which countries might be affected.Victim had volunteered to work at ThanksgivingMs Beckstrom had enlisted on 26 June 2023 and was assigned to the 863rd Military Police Company, 111th Engineer Brigade of the West Virginia Army National Guard. She had volunteered to work in Washington over the US holiday Thanksgiving, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News following the shooting.\"My baby girl has passed to glory,\" her father Gary Beckstrom posted on Facebook. The other National Guard member, Andrew Wolfe, is still in a \"critical condition\". \"We are doing everything we can to assist his family and to make sure that they have everything they need during this difficult time for them,\" Jeanine Pirro said on Friday morning.Both soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol in downtown Washington. More than 2,000 troops have been guarding the nation's capital since August, when the president began deploying troops to cities to tackle what he called \"out of control\" crime.Ms Beckstrom and Mr Wolfe were deployed in August, the West Virginia National Guard confirmed to BBC News.National Guard troops are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.The location of the shooting, just blocks from the White House, meant a number of law enforcement officials arrived quickly at the scene to treat the two victims and apprehend the gunman.The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanSuspect once worked alongside CIA in AfghanistanOfficials said Mr Lakanwal came to the US from Afghanistan in 2021, under a programme which offered special immigration protections to Afghans in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. At the time, the Taliban had taken back control of Afghanistan, raising fears of retribution against those who had co-operated with the US. Mr Lakanwal had helped guard US forces at Kabul airport in 2021 as thousands scrambled to escape Afghanistan as the Taliban swept back to power, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC.The suspect had been recruited to Unit 03 of the Kandahar Strike Force. His unit was known locally as Scorpion Forces, operating initially under the CIA but eventually for the Afghan intelligence department known as the National Directorate of Security.Mr Lakanwal was a GPS tracker specialist, the former commander told the BBC, describing him as a \"sporty and jolly character\".His whole unit was moved from Kandahar to Kabul five days before the Taliban entered the capital. They continued to protect the airport for another six days, before they too were airlifted out to the US.At a press conference on Thursday, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Mr Lakanwal's connection to US forces, saying the suspect \"had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces\", before moving to the US.CIA Director John Ratcliffe said he worked with the intelligence agency.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told CBS.Additional reporting by Hafizullah Maroof and Sayed Abdullah Nizami",

    "body": "Scientists believe they have recorded electrical activity in the Martian atmosphere for the first time, suggesting the planet is capable of lightning.Nasa's Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology and has spent the last four years exploring the Jezero Crater region.Electrical discharges nicknamed \"mini lightning\" were picked up from audio and electromagnetic recordings made by the rover's SuperCam instrument.Scientists hope new instruments for measuring atmospheric discharges and more-sensitive cameras could be sent to Mars to try to confirm the findings.A team of researchers from France analysed 28 hours of microphone recordings made by the Nasa rover over two Martian years (or 1,374 Earth days).They found that electrical discharges were normally associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts.Dust devils are small whirlwinds that form from hot air rising from the ground, and their internal movements can give rise to electrical discharges.Lead author of the research Dr Baptiste Chide told news agency Reuters: \"These discharges represent a major discovery, with direct implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability and the future of robotic and human exploration.\"He and other scientists at the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in France believe that Mars now joins Earth, Saturn and Jupiter as planets known to have atmospheric electrical activity.Particle physicist Dr Daniel Pritchard wrote in scientific journal Nature that, although the recordings would \"provide persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges\", because the discharges were only heard and not seen, \"some doubt will inevitably remain as to whether this really was Martian lightning\". He added: \"Given the history of this field, the debate is likely to continue for some time.\"In September this year, scientists found rocks with unusual markings on Mars. The intriguing markings, nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds, contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient microbes.It is possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found.Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life.Perseverance was dispatched to the Jezero Crater because it showed qualities that may have meant it was once conducive to life, including signs it was once a delta when Mars could sustain liquid surface water.",

    "body": "Just nowRaffi BergReutersA gun battle and air strikes resulted in the deadliest incident of its kind for monthsAt least 13 people have been killed in an Israeli raid on a village in southern Syria overnight, state media reported, in one of the deadliest incidents of its kind for months. It said children were among the dead.Sana news agency said residents of Beit Jinn \"confronted\" Israeli troops, leading to a firefight. Air strikes were also carried out. Syria's foreign ministry condemned what it called a \"war crime\" by Israel.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops went into the village, on the edge of the occupied Golan Heights, to detain militants who it said \"advanced terror attacks against Israeli civilians\".Six Israeli soldiers were injured in the clashes, three seriously, it said. The IDF said it targeted the Jamaa Islamiya militant group in Friday's operation. It said that when the raid began, \"several armed terrorists opened fire\" on its soldiers, who fired back. Sana said the village was also shelled. Footage released by the IDF shows two air strikes - one apparently on a group of people, and the other on a building. In bodycam footage also released by the IDF, soldiers can be seen firing on a street in the dark with the sound of automatic gunfire in the distance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, said a building collapsed during the operation.The IDF later said \"all of the suspects were apprehended, and a number of terrorists were eliminated\".Sana said three people were arrested by the troops before they withdrew.ReutersIsrael said it targeted militants, although Syria said women and children were among the deadSana quoted the director of a local hospital as saying it had received bodies, including five from one family. The director said dozens of people had also been injured in the incident.The Syrian foreign ministry said more than 10 civilians had been killed, including women and children. It accused Israel of committing a \"fully-fledged war crime\", and called on the UN Security Council to do something to stop Israel's \"policy of aggression\". Israel regularly carries out incursions into Syrian villages, saying it acts to prevent the presence of armed groups.Since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad nearly a year ago, Israel has moved its forces across a buffer zone on the Golan Heights into southern Syria, where a number of anti-Israel groups and cells operate.Israel says it will not allow the Syrian army, which it considers a threat, to deploy there.The buffer zone - a demilitarised stretch of land - had been a no-go area designed to keep the peace after a ceasefire ended the 1973 war between Israel and Syria. The UN has said the IDF's deployment there was a \"violation\" of the agreement which it said both sides should uphold.The US has for months been mediating talks between Israel and Syria for a security agreement in the area between the two sides, but without success.",

    "body": "A Tunisian court has handed jail terms to dozens of opposition leaders, lawyers and businessmen accused of attempting to overthrow the nation's president.Forty people including opposition leader Jawahar Ben Mbarek were handed sentences ranging from four to 45 years over the alleged conspiracy to oust President Kais Saied.Twenty of those charged have fled abroad and were sentenced in absentia, while others have been held in detention since 2023.Human rights groups have criticised the trial as politically motivated, characterising the prosecutions as an escalation of Saied's crackdown on dissent since he suspended Tunisia's parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree.Tunisian authorities argue the defendants, who include former head of intelligence Kamel Guizani, attemtpted to destabilise the country and topple Saied. Ben Mbarek and party leaders Issam Chebbi and Ghazi Chaouachi received jail terms of 20 years. All three have been detained since the 2023 crackdown.The maximum sentence, 45 years, was given to businessman Kamel Ltaif, while opposition politician Khyam Turki received a 35-year term.Ben Mbarek has been on hunger strike for over a month and was at risk of dying, news agency AFP reports, citing his sister and lawyer Dalila Ben Mbarek.Among those sentenced in absentia was politician and feminist Bochra Belhaj Hmida, as well as French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, human rights groups say.The final sentences were issued by an appeals court after the opposition figures were initially sentenced in April. Saied had branded them \"terrorists\".A lawyer for the defendants was quoted by Reuters as describing the trial as a \"farce\" that had the \"clear intent to eliminate political opponents\".Human rights groups have also been critical of the prosecutions.Sara Hashash, deputy regional director at Amnesty International, described the sentences as \"unjust\" and \"an appalling indictment of the Tunisian justice system\".She said that while three defendants were acquitted by the appeals court, it had increased others' sentences.\"The Court of Appeal has thereby also rubber stamped the government's use of the justice system to eliminate political dissent.\"After the initial ruling in April, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said the trial had raised \"serious concerns about political motivations\", and urged the Tunisian government to \"refrain from using broad national security and counter terrorism legislation to silence dissent\".On Saturday, thousands of Tunisians marched through the capital, Tunis, in an anti-government protest, accusing Saied of cementing a one-man rule through the judiciary and police.Saied was elected in 2019 after Tunisia emerged from the Arab Spring democracy movement.But the north African nation has since seen democratic backsliding and the re-imposition of aspects of authoritarian rule.",

    "body": "19 hours agoJon Donnison,JerusalemandDoug FaulknerWatch: BBC correspondent examines footage showing moments leading up to shooting in the occupied West BankVideo has emerged showing Israeli security forces shooting dead two Palestinians who appeared to have surrendered in the occupied West Bank.The incident happened during an ongoing Israeli military operation in the city of Jenin. The Palestinian Authority (PA) accused Israeli forces of committing a \"war crime\" and described the killings as \"brutal\" field executions.The Israeli military and police say the men were wanted men \"affiliated with a terror network\" and the incident is under review. Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has given his full backing to the officers involved, adding that \"terrorists must die\".The video shows two Palestinian men come out of a building with their hands up. They are surrounded by a number of Israeli border guards. They then kneel on the ground. One of them lifts his t-shirt, apparently to show that he is not armed.After a short period, they move back into the building. Border police then open fire, killing them.A joint statement from the IDF and police said forces had been trying to apprehend wanted individuals who had carried out \"terror activities\", including throwing explosives and firing at security forces.\"The forces entered the area, enclosed the structure in which the suspects were located, and initiated a surrender procedure that lasted several hours,\" the statement said.\"Following the use of engineering tools on the structure, the two suspects exited. Following their exit, fire was directed toward the suspects.\"Writing on X, Ben-Gvir said \"the fighters acted exactly as expected of them\".The raid in Jenin is the latest in a months-long Israeli campaign in cities in the northern West Bank, which Israel says is necessary to tackle Palestinian armed groups it says were responsible for attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers. On Wednesday the Israeli military launched an operation in the nearby city of Tubas.Violence in the West Bank has spiked since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which led to a devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza.Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, including members of armed groups and civilians, in the West Bank since then, the UN says. At least 44 Israelis, including soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during Israeli military operations, Israel says. ",

    "body": "Zelensky's chief of staff resigns after Ukrainian anti-corruption raid on his homeJust nowPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor andJaroslav LukivReutersYermak has for years been Zelensky's closest aide and has played a key role in talks towards ending the warUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Yermak, 54, has been Zelensky's closest adviser throughout Russia's full-scale war, but has come under increasing pressure over an escalating scandal - even though he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.Zelensky recently appointed his chief of staff to head crucial negotiations, with US President Donald Trump leading a new drive to end the war with Russia.In a stark address to the nation outside his presidential office, Zelensky called for unity, warning: \"We risk losing everything: ourselves, Ukraine, our future.\"Ukraine's two anti-corruption agencies raided Yermak's apartment in Kyiv's government quarters early on Friday and the chief of staff said on social media that \"from my side there is full co-operation\".\"I'm grateful to Andriy that Ukraine's position on the negotiating track was always presented as required: it was always a patriotic position,\" Ukraine's president said during his video address in Kyiv on Friday.Zelensky said he would start consultations on Saturday on who would replace Yermak as his top adviser: \"When all the attention is focused on diplomacy and the defence in a war, inner strength is required.\"\"Russia wants Ukraine to make mistakes – there won't be any mistakes from our side. Our work continues, our fight continues. We have no right... to retreat, to quarrel [among ourselves].\"Yermak's departure from Ukraine's leading circle will come as a major blow for Zelensky, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as part of Trump's draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week.Even hours before the raid on his flat, Yermak underlined the significant influence he held in Ukraine's leadership, conveying his government's position as it comes under US pressure to make territorial concessions to Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\"As long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory,\" Yermak told The Atlantic website.Russia has demanded that Ukraine hand over territory it still controls in the eastern Donetsk region, including several strategically important cities. \"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Putin said on Thursday.Yermak admitted during his interview he was under \"enormous\" pressure to stand down, adding \"the case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\".Zelensky's own position has been weakened by the domestic corruption scandal, which has rocked Ukraine for weeks.Investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector.Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.Zelensky has already fired two ministers and several suspects have been detained in the scandal. One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has fled the country.Mindich was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.",

    "body": "Peru's former President Pedro Castillo is among two of the South American nation's ex-leaders to be handed prison sentences in as many days.The left-wing leader was given 11 years in jail on Thursday for attempting to disband Peru's Congress and rule by decree in 2022. The gamble failed, and he was impeached and arrested.He was found guilty of \"conspiracy to commit rebellion\" by the Supreme Court, which handed down the sentence at the same time as convicting him.Castillo's sentence comes just a day after another former Peruvian president, Martín Vizcarra, was handed 14 years' in prison for bribe-taking while serving as a regional governor.The centrist politician, who had championed the fight against corruption during his term in office, was found guilty of taking bribes while governor of the Moquegua region between 2011 and 2014.Prosecutors said he received bribes worth more than $600,000 (£453,753) from construction companies who were seeking contracts for public works. Vizcarra has always maintained his innocence.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court acquitted Castillo of two other charges.Dubbed Peru's first poor president, Castillo, a former trade unionist and rural schoolteacher, won power in 2021 on a wave of frustration with conventional politics.His arrest and impeachment sparked deadly mass protests in 2022 among his working-class rural base. The protests were brutally repressed by security forces, leaving at least 50 dead.On Thursday, dozens of Castillo's supporters gathered outside the prison he is being held in to await the verdict, according to AFP.One supporter, Julia Buendia, told the news agency she still believed Castillo was innocent.Vizcarra and Castillo are the latest in a series of former Peruvian presidents to be jailed for misconduct. Ollanta Humala, who served as the nation's president between 2011 and 2016, was found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison earlier this year.Meanwhile, Alejandro Toledo, who governed it from 2001 to 2006, was sentenced last year to more than 20 years in prison for taking $35m (£26m) in bribes from a construction company.Peru has been beset by political crises in recent years.In October, clashes between anti-government protesters and riot police in the Peruvian capital, Lima, left one man and more than 100 injured.The protests came after the current President José Jerí was sworn in on an interim basis following the impeachment of his predecessor, Dina Boluarte.Boluarte was ousted by lawmakers on grounds of \"permanent moral incapacity\" amid soaring crime rates in Peru. Her presidency was overshadowed by several investigations, including a corruption inquiry dubbed \"Rolexgate\", concerning allegations she accepted Rolex watches as bribes.",

    "body": "Runaway nuns can stay in Alpine convent if they leave social media5 hours agoBethany BellIn ViennaBethany Bell/BBCSister Rita (L),  Sister Regina (C) and Sister Bernadette have gained a substantial following for their social media postsThree Austrian nuns in their 80s who ran away from the old people's home where they were placed have been told they can stay in their former convent \"until further notice\".However, Church authorities say they can only stay if they stop posting on social media.Sister Bernadette, 88, Sister Regina, who is 86 and 82-year-old Sister Rita are the last three nuns at the Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen, just outside Salzburg.The three nuns say they were taken out of the convent against their will in December 2023.In September, they moved back in with the help of former students and a locksmith, angering Church officials.The nuns' superior, Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey, called on them to return to the care home, saying their decision to return to the convent was \"completely incomprehensible\".The nuns' story sparked worldwide interest. Supporters helped them with food, electricity and social media, posting videos of the nuns' daily lives.These feature the nuns at prayer or at lunch, and include Sister Rita's exercise workouts. She was recently given a pair of boxing gloves.The Goldenstein nuns have amassed almost 100,000 followers on Instagram and several thousand on Facebook.Now after almost three months of standoff, a spokesman for the Provost, Harald Schiffl, has told Austrian Press Agency APA that the nuns can stay for now.It follows a meeting earlier this week, where a proposed solution to the standoff was suggested.The nuns could stay at the Kloster Goldenstein, Harald Schiffl told APA, but only under certain conditions.These include giving up their social media activities.Church officials also want the nuns to ensure that the enclosed part of the convent will no longer be accessible to people who do not belong to the order.In return, they will be allowed to stay and be provided with medical care and spiritual support from a priest.BBC/Bethany BellThe three nuns have lived in Schloss Goldenstein for decadesThe nuns have yet to agree to the conditions.\"Now it's up to the sisters,\" Harald Schiffl told APA.The BBC has contacted them for a response.The three nuns have spent much of their lives at Schloss Goldenstein, a castle which has been a convent and a private girls' school since 1877. The school, which started accepting boys in 2017, is still functioning.Sister Bernadette attended the school herself, arriving as a teenager in 1948. One of her fellow students was Austrian actress Romy Schneider, one of the world's biggest film stars of the 1960s and 70s.Sister Regina arrived at the convent in 1958 and Sister Rita in 1962.All three nuns went on to work at the school as teachers for many years. Sister Regina was headmistress.But the numbers of nuns dwindled. In 2022, the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the Reicherberg Abbey, an Augustinian monastery. Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey became the nuns' superior and the community was officially dissolved at the beginning of 2024.The remaining nuns were granted lifelong right of residence, as long as their health and mental capacity allowed.In December 2023, the decision was made to transfer them to a Catholic care home, where they felt unhappy.At the beginning of September, Sister Bernadette, Sister Rita and Sister Regina moved back, helped by a group of former students.The nuns told the BBC at the time that they were determined to stay.\"Before I die in that old people's home, I would rather go to a meadow and enter eternity that way,\" said Sister Bernadette.",

    "body": "Venezuela has banned six major international airlines from landing in the country after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights there.The airlines had temporarily suspended their routes into the capital, Caracas, after the US warned of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.Angered by this, the Venezuelan government issued the carriers with an ultimatum that expired on Wednesday. While a number of smaller airlines continue to fly to Venezuela, thousands of passengers have been affected.The US has deployed a large force to waters off Venezuela, which it says is to combat drug trafficking but which Venezuela's leader has denounced as an attempt to overthrow him. Venezuela's civil aviation authority, which reports to the country's ministry of transport, announced on Wednesday that Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines would lose their landing and take-off rights with immediate effect.In a reference to the heightened US military activity off the coast of Venezuela, it also accused the airlines of \"joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government and unilaterally suspending air commercial operations\".The US has deployed 15,000 troops and the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, to within striking distance of Venezuela.Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near VenezuelaThe US says the aim of the deployment, the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989, is to combat drug trafficking.US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they say were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, they have not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs and many analysts have pointed out that the US deployment is unusually large for a counter-narcotics operation. The Venezuelan government thinks the aim of the operation is to depose President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged. Amid the rising tensions, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued a warning on Friday to flight operators operating in Maiquetía, the international airport serving Caracas. It urged airlines \"to exercise caution... at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".It was in the wake of that warning that the now-banned airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela. An attempt by aviation industry body Iata to defuse the situation - by stressing that its member airlines were keen to restore operations - failed to appease the Venezuelan government.In recent days, both Maduro and his US counterpart Donald Trump have signalled a willingness to hold direct talks.Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said that he \"might talk\" to Maduro, but also warned that \"we can do things the easy way, that's fine, and if we have to do it the hard way that's fine, too\".Maduro, meanwhile, uploaded a video of himself driving around Caracas pointing to Christmas decorations, in what appeared to be an attempt to show that life in the city was going on as normal.",

    "body": "20 hours agoJon Donnison,BBC News, JerusalemandTom McArthur,BBC NewsWatch: Mohammed Ibrahim, 16, reunites with family after release from Israeli jailA Palestinian-American teenager who spent nine months in Israeli detention without charge has been freed.Mohammed Ibrahim was 15 when he was arrested in February in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where he was visiting on holiday from Florida, for allegedly throwing stones at Jewish settlers, which he previously denied.The US state department said it welcomed the news of Mohammed's release.The BBC has contacted the Israeli authorities but has not received a reply.Mohammed, now 16, was taken to hospital for treatment immediately after release, relatives told the media. They said he is, pale, underweight and is suffering from conditions contracted in captivity.In a statement, Mohammed's uncle spoke of the family's \"immense relief\". Zeyad Kadur said the family had been \"living a horrific and endless nightmare\" over the last nine months.\"Right now, we are focused on getting Mohammed the immediate medical attention he needs after being subjected to Israel's abuse and inhumane conditions for months. We just want Mohammed to be healthy and to have his childhood back,\" he said.\"Israeli soldiers had no right to take Mohammed from us in the first place,\" he added.The state department said it would continue to provide consular support to Mohammed's family. \"The Trump Administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens,\" it added.Earlier this week Mohammed's father Zahar Ibrahim told the BBC he was frustrated that the US government was not doing more to get his son out of jail.Twenty-seven US lawmakers had signed a letter to the state department and President Donald Trump, demanding more be done to release him.Mr Ibrahim, a father-of-four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, previously said his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.He had not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February, and only heard what had happened to him in detention through court documents.Mohammed was held without charge in Ofer prison on the West Bank. It is also home to adult prisoners, some of whom have been convicted of serious terrorism offences and murder.There are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.Following Mohammed's release, Mr Kadur said the family would also continue fighting for justice for his cousin Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old dual US citizen who the Palestinian health ministry said was beaten to death by Israeli settlers during a confrontation in July. At the time the Israeli military said authorities were looking into reports a Palestinian civilian had been killed.Mohammed and Sayfollah had worked together in the family ice cream shop in Tampa, Florida. No one has been charged with Sayfollah's killing.\"We expect the American government to protect our families,\" Mr Kadur said.",

    "body": "Quebec expands secularism law and limits public prayer20 hours agoJessica MurphyTorontoBloomberg via Getty ImagesQuebec Premier Francois Legault's government has passed a number of secularism laws in the Canadian provinceThe Canadian province of Quebec plans to impose restrictions on public prayer and limit the exclusive offering of religion-based menus, like kosher and halal meals, in public institutions.The latest efforts to strengthen state secularism, dubbed \"secularism 2.0\", are part of a new bill introduced by the governing Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) on Thursday, expanding on a 2019 religious symbols law that has fuelled fierce debate throughout the country. The original law prevents judges, police officers, teachers and public servants from wearing symbols such as the kippah, turban or hijab while at work.Canada's Supreme Court will hear a legal challenge of that law early next year. Jean-François Roberge, the minister responsible for secularism, told a news conference in French on Thursday that the bill was \"part of an approach that respected individual as well as collective rights\". The measures proposed in Bill 9 would: extend the ban on wearing religious symbols to staff in subsidised daycares bar \"collective religious practices\" like prayer in public spaces, such as parks, without prior authorisation from municipalitiesprevent students and staff from wearing face coverings in daycare all the way through to post-secondary educationRoberge said the limits on public prayer were in reaction to recent protests in the province, where there has been debate over groups praying at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. \"It's shocking to see people blocking traffic, taking possession of the public space without a permit, without warning, and then turning our streets, our parks, our public squares into places of worship,\" he said. The decision to strengthen the law has already faced criticism from the opposition Parti Québecois, which earlier this week accused the CAQ of creating division in an attempt to bolster support ahead of next year's provincial election. The National Council of Canadian Muslims also criticised the bill, accusing the CAQ of \"doubling down on identity politics and division in a desperate attempt to regain the public's trust\". Since Bill 21 was passed six years ago, the issue of secularism has continued to simmer in Quebec. Last year, 11 teachers - primarily of North African descent - at a Montreal elementary school were suspended after a government report said they had created a toxic environment for students and staff, and largely avoided certain subjects like science and sex education.Quebec Premier Francois Legault said the teachers had tried to introduce \"Islamist\" beliefs and vowed to strengthen secularism measures in schools.In August, a government-mandated committee released a report with recommendations including a ban on religious symbols for daycare workers and the phasing out of public funding for private religious schools.And last month, the Legault government passed a law extending secularism rules to staff who interact with students in public primary and high schools, and barring students from wearing face coverings. NurPhoto via Getty ImagesA sign for the federal Bloc Québécois that reads in French \"I choose secularism\"What is Quebec's secularism law?Bill 21 prohibits public officials in positions of authority - such as judges, police officers, teachers and public servants  - from wearing religious symbols such as the kippah, turban or hijab while at work.It also requires public services to be provided and received with the face uncovered.For Bill 21, the Quebec government invoked the \"notwithstanding clause\" - a part of the Canadian constitution that allows government to override \"fundamental freedoms\" of religion, expression, and association, as well as the right to life, liberty and security of the person, and freedom from discrimination. It essentially serves an opt-out that prevents courts from striking down the legislation on constitutional grounds.Bill 21 does not mention any specific religion and would include symbols worn by a person of any faith, including Christians, and affirms the religious neutrality of the province.But critics argue it targets mostly religious minorities, especially women of Muslim faith. The law has faced a number of legal challenges in Quebec. Canada's Supreme Court has now agreed to take up the case, which will hinge both on the law itself and the use of the notwithstanding clause. The debate over secularism - broadly, the principle that religion and government institutions should be separate - has played a significant role in the province's public discourse for almost two decades. Known in the majority French-speaking province as laïcité, it has been an important value in Quebec society since the 1960s as the Catholic Church's strong influence began to wane in the province.  A September survey by polling firm Leger, commissioned by media outlets Le Journal de Montréal and TVA, indicated that 68% of respondents thought secularism was an important value. Similar legislation to Bill 21 is in place in various countries across the EU.France passed a ban on veils, crosses and other religious symbols in schools in 2004 and on face covering in public spaces in 2010.

    "body": "2 hours agoNick ThorpeBudapest correspondentEPAOrban has met Putin several times since the start of Russia's full-scale warHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, days before Russia holds talks on a US push to end the war in Ukraine.Orban is seen as one of Putin's closest allies in Europe and he has consistently angered his Nato and EU allies by undermining solidarity against Russia.\"We are aware of your balanced position on the situation in Ukraine,\" Putin told Orban in remarks carried by Russian state TV.Putin also thanked the Hungarian prime minister for proposing Budapest as a potential venue for a Russia-US summit with President Donald Trump.\"Trump immediately said: ''We have good relations with Hungary, you have good relations with Viktor, and I do too, so I suggest this option.' Of course, we happily agreed,\" Putin said.Plans for a Budapest \"peace summit\" were proposed last month, but it was shelved reportedly because the Russian side had refused to compromise on Putin's maximalist demands for an end to the war.The Hungarian leader's Fidesz party faces parliamentary elections in April and polls suggest that for the first time in 15 years it could be defeated at the ballot box. If he were to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, it could help boost his chances of re-election.Orban, who last visited Moscow in July 2024, has repeatedly challenged EU attempts to end European imports of Russian oil and gas.He billed Friday's visit as the second leg of a strategy to ensure Russian energy supplies this winter, for Slovakia and Serbia as well as Hungary.Earlier this month in Washington, he secured exemption from US sanctions on Russian fuel - but only as long as he remains in power.Ever since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Orban has claimed to have been on the side of peace and told Hungarian state radio last week that \"Europe has decided to go to war in Ukraine\".He has strongly backed Trump's 28-point peace plan to end the war and during frantic diplomacy after it emerged, the Orban government and pro-Orban media have accused EU leaders of \"war-mongering\" for trying to adapt the plan to take account of Ukraine's objections.Joining Orban and Putin in the Kremlin were leading Russian officials, including Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, who is part of Russia's negotiating team with the US.In a letter this week to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the Hungarian leader called for immediate, unconditional peace talks, for the EU to launch direct negotiations with the Kremlin. He stressed his opposition to further EU funds for Ukraine, and rejected the use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukrainian defence.Now, with little sign of Russian willingness for compromise on Ukraine, Orban is focusing on Russian energy. Deals he struck in Washington to buy US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and start buying US nuclear fuel, mean Hungary will buy less of both from Russia, potentially annoying his Russian hosts.Orban argues that without deals with the US and Russia, heating prices would triple next month.Hungary is under pressure from the EU to end all imports of Russian energy by 2027 and is likely to use any agreement in Moscow to continue to defy Brussels.Hungary currently receives over 80% of its oil and gas, and 100% of its nuclear fuel from Russia, and total Hungarian trade contributes approximately $5bn annually to the Russian budget.A \"deal\" in Moscow does not appear difficult. Like Trump, Putin has made clear he wants Orban to win next April's election, so another diplomatic \"triumph\" for Orban would serve the interests of both sides. At this year's Valdai Forum in Sochi on 29 September, Putin praised Orban personally, and saluted \"nationally-oriented political forces\" gaining ground in Europe.\"If these forces in Europe continue to grow stronger, then Europe will be reborn,\" Putin said.",

    "body": "7 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterTicket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday.From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery.The museum's security and management have faced criticism since a brazen heist in October, when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes.An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure.From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum.Non-EU visitors in groups with accredited guides will also have to pay €28 starting next year, the Louvre told the BBC.The price hike is expected to raise between €15m and €20m each year to support the museum's modernisation plans, it added.The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum.There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues.In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026.Macron also said the Mona Lisa would be moved to a new space to deal with overcrowding.Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo.The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros.Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics due to structural concerns.The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration.",

    "body": "France to bring in form of military service, 25 years after conscription was phased out1 day agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisShutterstockPresident Macron said the new form of voluntary service was an \"act of trust in our youth\"A limited form of military service will be re-introduced in France in response to growing fears of a confrontation with Russia.More than 25 years after conscription was phased out, the plan will see young men and women volunteering for a paid 10 months of military training.\"The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it,\" President Emmanuel Macron said while announcing the plan at an infantry base near Grenoble in south-east France. \"We need to mobilise, mobilising the nation to defend itself, to be ready and remain respected.\" The new \"national service\" will be brought in gradually from next summer, mainly for 18- and 19-year-olds, who will receive at least €800 (£700) a month.\"In this uncertain world where might triumphs over right, war is in the present tense,\" said Macron. The armed forces would benefit from motivated young French men and women, he added: \"It is an act of trust in our youth.\"Initially, numbers will be restricted to 3,000 next year, but this should rise to 50,000 by 2035.France currently has around 200,000 military personnel and a further 47,000 reservists. The new scheme should usher in a three-tier structure, comprising professionals, reservists and volunteers.The change brings France in line with other European countries that have launched military service schemes - with varying parameters - because of fears of Russian aggression.Belgium and the Netherlands have introduced a voluntary military service, and Germany is planning something similar.Only this month, the Belgian defence ministry sent letters to 17-year-olds inviting them to volunteer for about €2,000 (£1,750) a month.Further east, Lithuania and Latvia have compulsory schemes, with cadets chosen by lottery. Sweden, which recently joined Nato, has started a nine- to 15-month military service with selection on merit.Some European countries, like Finland and Greece, have never stopped military service, while the Swiss are to vote on Sunday on replacing mandatory service for men with compulsory civic duty for all.Others countries, including the UK and Spain, currently have no plans to re-introduce it.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance began phasing out conscription in the late 1990sFrench military chiefs are broadly in favour of the new measure, which they hope will create a reservoir of trained personnel able to back up professional soldiers and replace them in non-frontline tasks.  It is also hoped many volunteers will stay on to lead full military careers.\"The new military service moves us in the direction of hybridisation of the armed forces,\" Thomas Gassilloud, president of the National Assembly's defence committee, said. \"We went too far in the direction of the all-professional.\"The threat of a looming, if ill-defined, stand-off with Russia has become part of France's national discourse. The government has regularly raised the alert over below-the-radar incidents or attempts by Moscow to poison opinion via social media.Recently, the newly appointed chief-of-staff, Gen Fabien Mandon, took the alarm to a new level when he said French military planning was built around the assumption of a confrontation with Russia in the next three or four years.ReutersGen Fabien Mandon prompted an outcry when he said French opinion had to be prepared for \"losing children\" at warHe went further last week, telling a gathering of mayors that what France lacked was the spirit of sacrifice, urging them to prepare opinion for the possibility of \"losing children\" in war.Immediately condemned by the far-left and part of the far-right, the remarks were also seen as unhelpful by the government, with Macron reassuring the country last weekend that there were no plans to send young recruits to fight in Ukraine.Polls show a large majority of the public in favour of voluntary military service. An Elabe survey this week found that 73% supported the measure. Young people – aged 25-34 – were the least supportive, but even in this age group there was a 60% majority.In a random BBC test of opinion on Paris streets, a similar picture emerged.\"It's a good thing,\" said Louis, a 22-year-old student. \"It can help make the army bigger, but it's also a way to love your nation more.\"Eilan, another student, said: \"In military service you meet people from everywhere. You learn new ways of seeing things... You learn to talk and trust and co-exist with other people.\"\"From what I read in the newspapers, our army is not that powerful - so if we have to prepare for the future, maybe it's a good idea,\" said set-designer Brigitte.But Lalie, a 21-year-old shop assistant, disagreed: \"I think there are more important issues. It's a pity the president is not really interested in young people – their mental health, their financial situation, and instead is focusing on this military service.\"It was in 1996 that then-President Jacques Chirac took the decision to end military service, as part of the peace dividend from the fall of the Soviet Union.Compulsory military training for young men had been part of national life since the French Revolution, which created the idea of the citizen-soldier.A 1798 law setting up conscription read: \"Every Frenchman is a soldier and is bound to the defence of the homeland.\" And after defeat by Prussia in 1871, Republican leader Léon Gambetta said: \"When in France a citizen is born, he is born a soldier.\"The Algerian war of independence was the last conflict fought by French conscripts, with more than 12,000 killed.By the 1990s, service had been reduced to 10 months, with options for civilian work instead.Since the last conscript passed out in 2001 there have been various, nebulous attempts to retain something of the spirit of military service, which proponents said fostered a sense of cohesion and equality.Lycée (high-school) students still have to attend a Day of Defence and Citizenship, where they are given lectures on rights and duties, and attend a flag-raising ceremony.In his first term, Macron also established a Universal National Service – a four-week course in civic responsibilities and practical training – which was supposed to build national solidarity following the terrorist attacks of the 2010s. But the scheme was panned as an expensive and ill-attended form of holiday camp, and was dropped earlier this year.Though this new scheme appears to enjoy a broadly favourable reception, there are still questions over its funding – with a debt crisis looming over the country and parliament still unable to approve a 2026 budget.",

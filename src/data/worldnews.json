    "body": "Hamas ruled Gaza with an iron rod - will it really give up control?2 days agoPaul Adams,Diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem and Rushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondentBBCHow does a group that has governed the Gaza Strip for almost 20 years, ruling two million Palestinians with an iron rod and fighting Israel in repeated wars, suddenly lay down its arms and relinquish control?Judging by a steady stream of gruesome images emerging from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, Hamas seems intent on reasserting its authority.Its masked men, back on the streets, have been seen beating and executing opponents. Impromptu firing squads have dispatched kneeling men they say are members of rival groups, including some of Gaza's powerful clans.Other victims, cowering in terror, are shot in the legs or beaten with heavy clubs.Some of those now being attacked by Hamas had been part of groups involved in looting and diverting aid, according to one aid worker I spoke to, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The UN has also accused criminal gangs of stealing aid.This is not yet a world in which, as US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan envisages, Hamas fighters turn over their weapons, submit to an amnesty, leave Gaza and hand over to an international stabilisation force.AFP via Getty ImagesThe ceasefire came into effect on Friday 10 October​ - Hamas and Israel have both blamed each other for blatant violations of itFor his part, President Trump initially seemed ambivalent about the brutality.On his way to Israel on 13 October, he signalled the US had given Hamas - designated a terrorist group by the US, UK, Israel and others - a green light to restore order.\"We have given them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.Three days later, he hardened his tone. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"So, where does this situation on the ground in Gaza today leave Hamas? And ultimately, after two years of war that has resulted in unparalleled suffering for its own people and the violent death of most of its key figures, what, if anything, does the future really hold for the group?'A complete loss of law and order'For many Gazans, traumatised and exhausted by two years of perpetual suffering - and a war that has killed 68,000 people in Gaza according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry - this ugly endgame is nerve-wracking, but doesn't come as a surprise.Of the Gazans I spoke to - among them, aid workers, lawyers, as well as a former adviser to a Hamas leader - each has a different take on the likelihood of Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing control. And indeed - given the situation on the ground - whether now is the time for them to do so.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians gathered to celebrate following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement \"It's been two years with a complete loss of law and order,\" aid worker Hanya Aljamal says from her home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. \"We need someone to take over.\"As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs.\"Dr Ahmad Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, who was Hamas's political leader, is of the opinion that a firm grip is needed at present.\"As long as there are still people who try to take the law into their hands, we need somebody to scare them and squeeze them to the corner,\" says Dr Yousef, who now runs a Gaza think tank and remains close to the Hamas leadership.'As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs,' argues aid worker Hanya Aljamal \"This will take time. Not a long time. Within a month we will host those police forces and soldiers from Turkey and Egypt,\" he continues, referring to the international stabilisation force for Gaza, outlined in the peace plan, that could be composed of troops from Egypt and Turkey, among others. \"This is the moment where they will set their guns aside.\"Other Gazans are more sceptical, and fearful. Some aren't convinced that Hamas will give up their power - or weapons at all.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer imprisoned several times by Hamas, is one of them. AFP via Getty ImagesMany Palestinians and Israelis doubt Hamas is willing to step back from a political roleHe has been in hiding since July, when he says masked Hamas gunmen came to his Gaza City apartment and ordered him to report to al-Shifa hospital for interrogation.\"Hamas is [sending] a message to the world and to President Donald Trump… that they will neither relinquish power nor hand over their weapons.\"If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head,\" he says in one of a series of videos sent to us from an undisclosed location in the Gaza Strip. The wall behind him is riddled with bullet holes.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer: 'If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head'\"It is a gang, not a government,\" he says of Hamas. \"I don't want them to remain in Gaza… I don't want them in government, and I don't want them in security. I don't want to see their ideas spread in mosques, in the streets, or in schools.\"'Still the dominant player in Gaza'Mr al-Natour has his own take on what Gaza could look like.The disparate array of militias now under Hamas assault could, in his view, be integrated into a new security apparatus. But with their competing agendas, sometimes murky pasts and, in some cases, controversial links to the Israeli military, it's a problematic proposition.\"The fact is – and sometimes it's very hard for Israelis to admit this – that Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza.\" says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence.\"Relying on suspicious players - clans, militias, gangs, many of them criminals, many of them affiliated with ISIS [the Islamic State group], many of them involved in terror attacks against Israel - and considering them as a kind of alternative to Hamas is an illusion.\"'Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza' says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military IntelligenceHamas officials have said the group is willing to hand over political control of Gaza. The Trump ceasefire plan, to which it gave its qualified support, envisages \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\".But even if the group is willing to step back from a political role – something many Palestinians and Israelis still doubt - persuading its battle-hardened fighters to lay down their weapons is a big step for an organisation whose power, even before October 2023, relied heavily on the force of arms.Rise of Hamas and its iron gripTo begin to answer the complex question of what may happen to Hamas next requires delving backwards into how exactly it consolidated power in the first place.From its origins in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and a rival to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas morphed into a violent militant group responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians.Initially, Israel offered discreet support to Hamas, seeing it as a useful counterweight to the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah, led at the time by Yasser Arafat.\"The major enemy was Fatah,\" says Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, \"because they were the people who demanded a Palestinian state.\"But when Hamas launched deadly suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s and 2000s on Israelis, Israel responded with a series of high-profile assassinations.A violent power struggle with Fatah left Hamas, which won a 2006 election, in sole control of the Gaza Strip.Eighteen years of Hamas rule have followed, characterised by an Israeli military and economic blockade, and bouts of armed conflict in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021.Despite Israeli claims since October 2023 that \"Hamas is ISIS\", the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously convinced itself that Hamas did not pose a strategic threat.\"His was a policy of managing the conflict,\" says Mr Ayalon. \"He said we are not going to solve it and we are totally against the reality of two states, so the only way is to divide and control.\"With Hamas in control in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, ruling in part of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinians remained hopelessly divided, enabling Israel to argue that it had no unified leadership to negotiate peace with.\"[Netanyahu] did everything in order to support Hamas in Gaza,\" Mr Ayalon says. \"He let Qatar send them… more than $1.5bn.\"Getty ImagesIsrael has gone to enormous lengths to eliminate Hamas's key political and military figuresThe money from Qatar was meant to pay the wages of civil servants and support the poorest families, but security chiefs feared it was being used for other purposes.Mr Ayalon adds: \"It was clear to the director of the Shin Bet and the head of Mossad that this money would go to military infrastructure.Netanyahu has defended allowing payments to Hamas, saying it was meant to aid the civilian population.Hamas was always preparing for warAs 7 October brutally revealed, Hamas was always preparing for war. Nowhere was this more obvious than in its elaborate network of tunnels.Tunnels had already been used to mount attacks on Israeli army positions during the second Palestinian uprising, or \"Intifada\" that began in 2000.In 2006, Hamas fighters used a tunnel under the border with Israel to attack a military post near Kerem Shalom, killing two Israel soldiers and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. He was held for five years until his release, in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, who would go on to mastermind the Hamas attacks of October 2023.Getty ImagesYahya Sinwar, one of those behind the Hamas attacks of October 2023Over time, Hamas' tunnel network expanded, to include workshops, weapons-manufacturing sites and command centres.Regional developments also played a role. In 2012, after the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the brief rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas was able to smuggle increasingly sophisticated weapons into Gaza, including sniper rifles, mobile rocket launchers and equipment for the manufacture of long-range rockets.Hamas is thought to have benefitted from the help of technicians and fighters with experience of tunnelling in places like Lebanon and Iraq.Iran was also a key supporter, seeing Hamas as a natural component in its \"Axis of Resistance,\" a loose coalition of militant groups across the Middle East with a shared antipathy towards Israel and the United States.In 2020, a US State Department report said that Iran was providing around $100m a year to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesOver time, Hamas' tunnel network expandedSome tunnels were reportedly dug as deep as 230ft (70m) below ground, took years to build and cost tens of millions of dollars each. These were designed to protect senior Hamas commanders and house long-range weapons.A local expert with extensive knowledge of the tunnels told the BBC the cost of the entire project totalled roughly $6bn (£4.5bn).Precise figures are hard to come by, but it's thought that the scattered network extended for as much as 250 miles (400km), in a strip of land just 26 miles long and, at its widest, seven miles across.Tunnels: a project shrouded in secrecyPublic discussion of the tunnels - their location or cost - could expose Gazans to accusations of espionage, leading to arrest and worse. But many knew what was happening. Local residents would see the tell-tale signs: sand and clay being removed, new entrances appearing unexpectedly and machinery being brought in under cover of darkness.What began as an opportunistic response to Gaza's isolation became, over the span of three decades, a multi-layered subterranean industrial and military complex.It emerged later that much of it was concealed under Gaza's civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and, in the case of a tunnel containing a Hamas data centre, the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesAt least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since since October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministryAfter 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, it also became a massive underground prison. Not all of those held hostage were concealed in tunnels, but many were, especially as the war ground on.Eli Sharabi, who became one of the most high profile of those taken, was first moved from a safe house into a tunnel after 52 of his 491 days in captivity. \"They tied us with ropes in our legs and hands,\" he told the BBC earlier this month. \"I fainted from time to time from the pain. One time they broke my ribs.\"By the time he was released, in February, he had lost more than 30kg (4st 10lb).EPAEli Sharabi, who was held hostage, was moved from a safe house into a tunnel. 'They tied us with ropes,' he has saidHamas used the hostages as bargaining chips, to secure ceasefires or the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As negotiations over their fate continued, Hamas drip fed the Israeli public with a cruel series of videos, often showing the hostages in situations of extreme distress.Eventually it was, says Dr Yousef, internal and external pressure that forced Hamas to abandon the strategy.\"Qatar, Egypt and Turkey and also the people here in displacement camps sent a strong message to Hamas leaders outside that enough is enough.\"Getty ImagesIsrael assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024In the meantime, Israel continues to destroy what it can of the tunnel network, often demolishing civilian neighbourhoods above in the process.And the job is far from done.\"According to publications from the defence establishment, estimates speak of damage to between 25% and 40% of the tunnels,\" says Yehuda Kfir, an Israeli civil engineer and underground warfare researcher at Haifa's Technion University.\"No doubt [Hamas] aspires to rehabilitate the infrastructure, including restoring tunnels that were dealt with in various ways by the IDF.\"A leadership in tattersRestoring tunnels is one thing. Reconstituting the organisation is another. After the events of the past two years, Hamas' leadership is in tatters.Israel has gone to enormous lengths - in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon and Qatar - to eliminate the group's key political and military figures. From its best known, internationally recognisable leaders, travelling the world to promote their cause, to its battalion commanders on the ground in Gaza, Hamas has lost almost everyone of consequence.Israel assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024.

Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri (right) was killed in Beirut blastDespite the loss of these leading figures - and thousands of members of its armed wing - the group battled on, recruiting a fresh generation of radicalised young fighters and splintering into small cells intent on carrying out hit-and-run guerrilla-style operations.But Hamas in October 2025 is a pale shadow of the organisation that carried out the attacks of 7 October. Today's leaders are less well known and, crucially, have little political experience.Ezzedine al-Haddad, who is 55, now heads the five-member military council that commands Hamas' armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.EPA/ ShutterstockMany of the group's key political and military figures have been killed. (L-R) Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Sheikh Ahmed YassinOutside Gaza, the remnants of the group's political leadership include Khaled Meshaal (the subject of a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997), Khalil al-Hayya and Muhammad Darwish.All are believed to have escaped death on 9 September, when Israeli jets attacked a building in Doha, Qatar, where they were meeting to discuss the latest US ceasefire proposals.Hamas is 'tired of war'Despite the violence still raging in Gaza, the former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, says the group is tired of war. Without mentioning 7 October directly, he describes the cause of the war as a \"terrible mistake\" and that a \"different approach\" is needed.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPeople sit among the rubble and wreckage of war in Gaza. The former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, claims Hamas is also tired of war\"I'm talking to many of them and they have said that they are not interested in ruling Gaza anymore,\" he says. \"But Hamas has more than 100,000 members and those people are not going to disappear.\"Hamas, he suggests, is looking to rebrand itself in order to continue to play a political role in the future, a process he likens to the ANC's transition from guerrilla warfare to political rule in post-apartheid South Africa.\"If tomorrow there [are] elections,\" he says, \"I'm sure Hamas will come under different names, giving the impression it is more peaceful and more willing to be part of political life. \"Violence is not going to be part of any political party.\"Dr Milshtein is doubtful.\"Even if there will be a new local regime in Gaza, of course behind the scenes Hamas will be the dominant player,\" he argues.Anadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael may have to deal with Hamas for some time to comeDisarmament, he continues, is even less likely: he predicts another Gaza war within the next five years.But Ami Ayalon, the former Shin Bet chief, believes Israel should find another way to tackle its enemy.\"Unless we defeat the ideology, they will flourish,\" he says. \"The only way to defeat the ideology is by creating and presenting to the Palestinian and the Israeli people a new horizon. A horizon of two states.\"For now, that horizon does not exist, perhaps making Dr Milshtein's prediction more likely than Ami Ayalon's vision of a shared future.But Hamas, however diminished, is far from a spent force. One way or another, Israel may have to deal with it for some time to come.Additional reporting: BBC MonitoringTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoAoife WalshWashingtonWatch as parts of White House East Wing torn downUS President Donald Trump has said the \"existing structure\" of the White House East Wing must be torn down in order to construct a new $250m (£186m) ballroom.  Crews began demolishing parts of the structure on Monday, and two administration officials earlier told the BBC's US partner CBS that it will be completely torn down by the weekend.It marks a significant expansion of the construction project announced over the summer. Trump previously said his ballroom addition would not \"interfere with the current building\". He rejected accusations he had not been transparent over the extent of the works, telling reporters on Wednesday: \"I think we've been more transparent than anyone's ever been.\" The White House has served as the historic home of the US president for two centuries. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and was last modified in 1942.It is a section of the White House that holds offices for the first lady and other staff, as well as meetings and special events. Trump said the building had gone through several changes over the years and was \"very, very much changed from what it was originally\". He added that was \"never thought of as being much\" and that the changes have been wanted \"for at least 150 years\". The construction was being fully funded by Trump and \"some friends of mine - donors\". The military is also involved, he added.Getty ImagesConstruction work began on MondayGetty ImagesThe US president announced construction had begun in a social media post on Monday, saying \"ground has been broken\" on the \"much-needed\" ballroom space.He said that the East Wing was \"completely separate\" from the White House, although it is attached to the main structure.The Trump administration officials told CBS it was always the case that the East Wing would have to be modernised to enhance security and technology, but that during the planning process, it became apparent that the best option would be to demolish the entirety of the East Wing.Trump says White House renovation is 'music to my ears' as criticism mountsWho is paying for Trump's White House ballroom?His comments came after the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Washington non-profit organisation that protects historic US sites, wrote a letter to White House officials saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by the project.The trust asked Trump to pause demolition work, arguing that the White House was a national historic landmark and that officials needed to hold a public review process of the plan for the ballroom.Some Democrats have been critical of the renovation, including Hilary Clinton, who ran against Trump for the US presidency in 2016.In a post on X, she wrote that the White House was not Trump's house, and \"he's destroying it\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéJudges in Cameroon have dismissed calls for the partial or total cancellation of the heavily disputed presidential election, saying they will announce the result on Monday.Major cities in the country have been rocked by protests, with opposition supporters alleging that the 12 October poll was marred by irregularities, including ballot-stuffing. Judges on the Constitutional Council dismissed eight petitions, citing insufficient evidence of irregularities or a lack of jurisdiction to annul results. Opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary has declared himself the winner - a claim rejected by allies of 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who is seeking another seven-year term.Biya has been in power for 43 years, and addressed only one campaign rally ahead of the election. Tchiroma Bakary, 76, is a former government spokesman who broke ranks with Biya to challenge him for power. He refused to file complaints with the Constitutional Council, whose judges have been appointed by Biya, choosing instead to declare himself the \"legal and legitimate president\". Can the world's oldest president keep his title?The African president who keeps defying death rumoursIn a video statement posted on social media, Tchiroma Bakary said he had won the election with about 55% of the vote, based on what he waid were returns representing 80% of the electorate.\"If the Constitutional Council proclaims falsified and truncated results, it will be complicit in a breach of trust,\" he declared.Tchiroma Bakary also warned that \"with their backs against the wall, the people will have no choice but to take their destiny into their own hands and seek victory wherever they can find it\".Biya's ruling party has dismissed his claims of victory and several officials have described it as illegal because only the Constitutional Council can proclaim official results.The influential Catholic Church this week urged the judges to ensure that the verdict reflected the will of voters.The growing tensions have sparked fears of post-electoral violence in a country already rocked by a separatist conflict in the Anglophone regions and Boko Haram insurgency in the Far North region.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Rachel HaganElon Musk's SpaceX says it has cut Starlink satellite communication links to more than 2,500 devices used by scam compounds in Myanmar.More than 30 compounds are believed to be operating along the Thai-Myanmar border, where people from around the world are trafficked and forced to work on scams generating tens of billions of dollars annually.Announcing the move, Lauren Dreyer, head of Starlink business operations, said the firm takes action on the rare occasion it identifies violations.The service's termination follows Monday's takeover of one of the largest compounds, KK Park, by the Myanmar military, as it retakes territory lost to insurgent groups over the past two years.Campaigners have long warned that Starlink technology has enabled the mainly Chinese crime syndicates to operate from remote locations along the border.Myanmar has become infamous for these operations, which defraud victims through romantic ploys and bogus investment schemes. Workers are lured under the guise of legitimate jobs, only to be held captive and forced into criminal activity.Survivors recount gruelling conditions, long hours, torture and beatings for failing to meet targets. Many of the victims come from African countries.\"In Myanmar... SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected 'scam centers',\" Dreyer said in a post on X.\"We are committed to ensuring the service remains a force for good and sustains trust worldwide: both connecting the unconnected and detecting and preventing misuse by bad actors,\" she added.On Monday Myanmar's military said it had \"cleared\" KK Park, releasing more than 2,000 workers and confiscating 30 Starlink terminals. Photographs show the satellite dishes on the compound's rooftops and footage supplied to the BBC showed thousands of workers leaving KK Park on foot.However, at least 30 other scam compounds remain active along the border, employing tens of thousands globally. Many are protected by militia groups loyal to the Myanmar military and it is unclear whether they have also lost access to Starlink services they once relied on.These centres have become a key component of Myanmar's wartime economy, as the junta battles various rebel groups while relying on Chinese support to maintain its hold on power.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS forces have struck another vessel alleged to be carrying drugs, this time in the waters of the Pacific Ocean, the Pentagon said.According to defence secretary Pete Hegseth, two people on board the vessel were killed and no US forces were harmed. The vessel was known to US intelligence and was believed to be carrying drugs along a known trafficking route in international waters, Hegseth added.The strike marks the eighth US strike against suspected drug boats since 2 September - but the first in the Pacific.President Donald Trump said he has legal authority to continue bombing boats in international water but said he may go to the US Congress if he decides to expand targets on land.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do (it) by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. He said his administration was \"totally prepared\" to expand the anti-drug operations on land, which would mark a deep escalation. In the Oval Office with Trump, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that \"if people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States\".Video of the strike appears to show a long, blue speed boat moving through the water before being struck by US ordinance. \"Narco-terrorists intending to bring position to our shores will find no safe harbour anywhere in our hemisphere,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Just as Al Qaeda wages war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people.\" \"There will be no refuge or forgiveness - only justice,\" he added. In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.At least 34 people have been killed in the American strikes on alleged drug boats, including a recent strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean.Two men survived a strike last week, and were repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador. Ecuador's government later released one man - identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño - saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing. The other man, from Colombia, reportedly remains hospitalised. US President Donald Trump and administration officials have repeatedly justified the strikes as counter-narcotics measures necessary to fight drug-trafficking organisations, several of which have been designated as terrorist organisations by the US. Citing a defence official, CBS has reported that the strike took place in international waters near Colombia. Speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump defended the operations, calling them \"a national security problem\".News of the strike comes amid rising tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\".\"He better watch it or we'll take very serious action against him and his country,\" Trump said. \"He has led his country into a death trap.\"On Sunday, Trump denounced Petro as an \"illegal drug leader\" who is \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia.\"Trump added that the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, which has historically been one of its closest allies in Latin America. Both Colombia and nearby Ecuador have significant Pacific coastlines that experts have said are used to funnel drugs north towards the US through Central America and Mexico. US estimates from the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, indicate that the vast majority of cocaine bound for US cities passes through the Pacific. Drug seizures in the Caribbean - where the bulk of confirmed US strikes have so far taken place - account for a relatively small percentage of the total, although US officials have warned it is rising.To date, US officials have offered few details on the identities of those killed in the strikes or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belong to.Around 10,000 US troops, as well as dozens of military aircraft and ships, have been deployed to the Caribbean as part of the operation.",

    "body": "At least 42 people have been killed in an oil tanker explosion in Nigeria's central Niger state after the vehicle skidded off the road and crashed, spilling fuel, an aid worker has told the BBC.Another 52 people with varying degrees of injuries are currently receiving treatment at a hospital, said Abdullahi Baba Ara, head of the Niger state emergency service.Villagers rushed to collect fuel from the overturned tanker which suddenly exploded, setting off a massive fire that engulfed them. Tanker explosions are a recurring tragedy in Nigeria, despite repeated warnings about the dangers of collecting spilled fuel. The intense blaze burned many victims beyond recognition, and the injured were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.The accident occurred near the Essan and Badeggi communities along the Bida-Agaie road in the Katcha Local Government Area of Niger state.The Nigerian truckers risking attackDriver of burning fuel tanker honoured for heroismNiger State Governor Mohammed Umaru Bago sent his condolences to the people, describing the incident as \"worrisome, unfortunate and pathetic\".\"[It] is disheartening how people have continued to approach a fallen tanker to scoop its contents\" despite several awareness campaigns, said a statement by his chief press secretary Bologi Ibrahim.The tanker, carrying petroleum products from Lagos in southern Nigeria to the north, is said to have crashed due to the bad condition of the road.Poor road conditions are a major contributor to road accidents in the country.In October last year, a fuel tanker explosion killed 153 people in Jigawa state, north-west Nigeria.In January this year, a truck carrying about 60,000 litres of petrol overturned near Suleja, also in Niger state, killing at least 86 people and injuring nearly 70 others.",

An investigation has been launched.The injured have been taken to different hospitals in the western town of Kiryandongo. In a statement, police said they were working with health and emergency services to verify the numbers and provide accurate updates as investigations continue into the cause of the tragedy.President Yoweri Museveni said he had learnt of the tragic accident \"with sadness\" and sent his condolences to the bereaved families. He urged caution to prevent such tragedies.He directed that each bereaved family be given five million shillings each ($1,430; £1,070) and a million shillings to the injured.The highway between the capital Kampala in the south and the northern city of Gulu is one of the country's busiest.Following the crash, police have urged motorists to avoid \"dangerous and careless overtaking\".It said this \"remains one of the leading causes of crashes in the country\".",

    "body": "Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now2 days agoAna Faguy, James FitzGerald and Nardine SaadGetty ImagesThe pair's divorce was finalised in 2007The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair's tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears's allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book's release by publisher Listenin. He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.When they were teenagers, the couple's sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. \"They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - 'Oh, you're awake?' - with a knife in her hand,\" he writes. \"Then she'd turn around and pad off without explanation.\"Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: \"The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it's racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we're getting close to the 11th hour.\"He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears's life were controlled by others for years, and described it as a \"lifeline\" in its early days.He claims Spears saw the events in her life \"through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one\", but that she \"needed help\" and was \"in no state to responsibly manage her own affairs\".Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could \"never fully get behind it\".What's the history of their relationship?The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears's initial commercial peak started to wane.They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.She made headlines with incidents like shaving her head and hitting a photographer's car with an umbrella.Those public incidents raised concern about her mental welfare, and after she was taken to hospital twice, a temporary conservatorship was established in 2008 and made permanent later that year.Spears remained under that controversial arrangement until 2021, under which her father and others controlled her finances and aspects of her personal life. She did not regain custody of her children until after it was lifted.Federline recalls that time as being \"like watching someone slowly lose control of their life\".\"I've lost faith that things will ever fully turn around, but I still hope that Britney can find peace,\" he adds.What has Spears said? Spears has accused Federline of attacking her during his recent press appearances to promote the book. She described the contents of the memoir as \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\", but suggested the work would sell better than her own memoir had done.In that book, The Woman in Me, Spears accused her ex-husband of trying to \"convince everyone I was completely out of control\".Spears has also defended her relationship with her sons. \"I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys,\" she wrote on social media on 15 October, adding that \"relationships with teenage boys is complex\".In a statement to US media, a Spears spokesperson added: \"With news from Kevin's book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James, and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.\"The BBC has contacted Federline's lawyer for comment on Spears's counter-accusations.Why is this happening now?While the pair dominated headlines during their relationship and subsequent divorce, Federline in particular has largely remained out of the limelight in recent years. And recently, the spotlight on Spears has largely been over her social media postings.Federline has said he considered writing a book for many years but wanted to wait until his children were older to complete it because he did not want make the weight of the world \"heavier\" on their shoulders.\"This is about finally telling my story,\" he writes. \"My version. In my words. Because everybody else has done it for me. The media. The blogs. The exes. The strangers. The jokes. The headlines. They all had something to say about me. And I stayed quiet.\"He denies claims that he \"was just coasting off her money\" and insists he was \"out there hustling, grinding, investing —working to build a solid foundation for myself and my kids\".He says he avoided responding publicly to media reports about him over the years because he wanted to protect his loved ones and give his kids \"some kind of normal life\".\"But silence didn't bring peace. It left me choking on the words I never said,\" he adds.",

    "body": "No camera covered Louvre wall where jewel thieves broke in, director says5 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe editor and Dearbail JordanWatch: \"Heist made it more exciting to go to the Louvre\", says tourist as museum reopensThe Louvre failed to spot a gang of thieves early enough to stop the theft of €88m (£76m) worth of French crown jewels, the museum's director has revealed.Laurence des Cars, speaking publicly for the first time since the heist on Sunday, told French senators that CCTV around the Louvre's perimeter was weak and \"aging\".The only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where they broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to Gallery of Apollo housing the jewels, she said.\"We failed these jewels,\" she said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".Ministers have given press conferences and interviews and denied security failings, but des Cars cut through that and admitted the Louvre had been \"defeated\".Her words gave an extraordinary insight into the difficulty of securing the world's most visited museum, and how bad its security really was.The CCTV system outside the Louvre was \"very unsatisfactory\" she said and inside, some areas were simply too old to adapt to modern technologies.Despite the museum's huge volume of visitors - 8.7 million last year alone - investment in security has been slow and she highlighted the budget challenges big institutions face.Des Cars, who became director of the Louvre in 2021, said she wanted to double the number of CCTV cameras.She said she was warned about how \"obsolete\" the equipment at the Louvre was when she took the job, in contrast to the modern equipment of the Musée d'Orsay, where she had worked previously.Some of the senators she faced at Wednesday's hearing expressed incredulity at the Louvre's security, asking why there was just one camera - on the external wall facing the river - and why it was pointing the wrong way. That single failure meant that the lorry carrying the gang and their mechanical ladder, used to reach the gallery's first floor, was not spotted at all as it arrived at the foot of the Gallery of Apollo.\"There is a weakness at the Louvre and I acknowledge it completely,\" des Cars told the senators. She praised security guards who she said acted quickly to evacuate the building as soon as they were aware there had been an intrusion, but she conceded: \"We did not spot the arrival of the thieves early enough... the weakness of our perimeter protection is known.\"Getty ImagesLouvre director Laurence des Cars acknowledged that security cameras were far from satisfactoryThe museum re-opened on Wednesday, although the gallery remained shut.The Louvre is home to priceless works of art including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. A hunt is still under way for the gang of four who, over the space of less than 10 minutes last Sunday morning, broke into one of the world's most famous museums. They made off with eight prized pieces of jewellery including a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife.As they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged, and Laurence des Cars told the senators that it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case. \"Initial assessments suggest that a delicate restoration is possible,\" des Cars said.How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Some of the museum's problems she raised at the hearing included cuts in surveillance and security staff over the past decade and decaying infrastructure that could not handle the latest generation of video equipment.The director hopes that work to improve security will begin at the start of 2026. However, it is expected to be challenging given the aging infrastructure of what was once a royal palace.Des Cars said she had tendered her resignation to the culture ministry after the heist but had been refused. She told senators she had been raising concerns about the state of the Louvre for some time.She became animated, even indignant, as she defended herself from media allegations that she prioritised her own comfort ahead of protecting the Louvre and its historic collections.\"I am wounded as chair and director that the warnings I was raising, as a whistle-blower, in a sense, have come to pass last Sunday.\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she said.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio on Wednesday that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors have said their theory is that the robbers were under orders for a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "1 day agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondentEPATrump and Putin's planned talks on the near four-year war in Ukraine have been put on holdReports of an impending US-Russia leadership summit have been greatly exaggerated, it seems.Just days after US President Donald Trump said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest - \"within two weeks or so\" - the summit has been suspended indefinitely.A preliminary get-together by the two nations' top diplomats has been cancelled, too.\"I don't want to have a wasted meeting,\" President Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. \"I don't want to have a waste of time, so I'll see what happens.\"Trump says he did not want 'wasted meeting' after plan for Putin talks shelvedDisappointment in Kyiv as Zelensky leaves White House empty-handedThe on-again, off-again summit is just the latest twist in Trump's efforts to broker an end to war in Ukraine – a subject of renewed focus for the US president after he arranged a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.While making remarks in Egypt last week to celebrate that ceasefire agreement, Trump turned to Steve Witkoff, his lead diplomatic negotiator, with a new request.\"We have to get Russia done,\" he said.However, the circumstances that aligned to make a Gaza breakthrough possible for Witkoff and his team may be difficult to replicate in a Ukraine war that has been raging for nearing four years.Less leverage According to Witkoff, the key to unlocking a deal was Israel's decision to attack Hamas negotiators in Qatar. It was a move that infuriated America's Arab allies but gave Trump leverage to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into making a deal.Trump benefited from a long record of siding with Israel dating back to his first term in office, including his decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, to change America's position on the legality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, more recently, his support for Israel's military campaign against Iran.The US president, in fact, is more popular among Israelis than Netanyahu – a position that gave him unique influence over the Israeli leader.Add in Trump's political and economic ties to key Arab players in the region, and he had a wealth of diplomatic muscle to force an agreement.In the Ukraine war, by contrast, Trump has much less leverage. Over the past nine months, he has swung between attempts to strong-arm Putin and then Zelensky, all with little seeming effect.Trump has threatened to impose new sanctions on Russian energy exports and to provide Ukraine with new long-range weapons. But he has also recognised that doing so could disrupt the global economy and further escalate the war.Meanwhile, the president has publicly berated Zelensky, temporarily cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine and suspending arms shipments to the country - only to then back off in the face of concerned European allies who warn a Ukrainian collapse could destabilise the entire region.Trump loves to tout his ability to sit down and hammer out deals, but his face-to-face meetings with both Putin and Zelensky haven't seemed to move the war any closer to a resolution.Getty ImagesTrump and Putin's meeting in August yielded no concrete resultsPutin may actually be using Trump's desire for a deal – and belief in in-person deal-making - as a means of influencing him. In July, Putin agreed to a summit in Alaska just as it appeared likely that Trump would sign off on congressional sanctions package backed by Senate Republicans. That legislation was subsequently put on hold.Last week, as reports spread that the White House was seriously contemplating shipping Tomahawk cruise missiles and Patriot anti-air batteries to Kyiv, the Russian leader called Trump who then touted the possible summit in Budapest.The next day, Trump hosted Zelensky at the White House, but left empty-handed after a reportedly tense meeting.Trump insisted that he was not being played by Putin.\"You know, I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,\" he said.But the Ukrainian leader later made note of the sequence of events. \"As soon as the issue of long-range mobility became a little further away for us – for Ukraine – Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,\" he said.So, in a matter of days, Trump has bounced from entertaining the prospect of sending missiles to Ukraine to planning a Budapest summit with Putin and privately pressuring Zelensky to cede all of Donbas – including territory Russia has been unable to conquer.He has finally settled on calling for a ceasefire along current battle lines – something Russia has refused to accept.On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised that he could end the Ukraine war in a matter of hours. He has since abandoned that pledge, saying that ending the war is proving harder than he expected.It has been a rare acknowledgement of the limits of his power – and the difficulty of finding a framework for peace when neither side wants, or can afford to, give up the fight.",

    "body": "2 days agoShaimaa KhalilJapan correspondentWatch: Moment Sanae Takaichi wins Japan's lower houseFor many young girls in Japan today, the image of Sanae Takaichi taking the helm of power as the country's first ever female leader is powerful and formative.It means a patriarchal society and a political system that has long been dominated by men is now led by a woman.But while the optics speak of a progressive moment, some women don't see her as an advocate for change.\"It was quite interesting to see how people outside Japan have reacted to the news.\" Ayda Ogura, 21, says.\"Everyone's like, 'wow, she's the first female prime minister in Japanese history and that would be a great opportunity for women empowerment and gender equality in Japan'.\"I think that's a very naive interpretation.\"Instead, Ms Ogura points to her \"political beliefs and what she stands for\", adding: \"She perpetuates the patriarchal system.\"Ayda Ogura, 21, warns this may not be the moment for gender equality in Japan some thinkA big fan of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has always wanted to be the \"Iron Lady\" of her country.And like Thatcher, Takaichi is a staunch conservative.Observers say her leadership is a tactical move from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to appeal to the more conservative base which had recently gravitated towards Japan's parties further to the right.Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and has long stood against legislation that would allow married couples to have separate surnames, preventing many women from keeping their maiden names.She's also against women being in line for succession in the imperial family.However, she did soften some of her messaging during her campaign - saying she favours giving tax incentives to companies that provide childcare facilities to their employees and spoke of possible tax breaks for families spending on childcare.But she has over the years backed the idea of a more traditional role for women in society and in the family.When it comes to women's issues, Takaichi is consistent with her country's less than impressive record on gender issues.Japanese women are among the best educated and highest qualified in the world and yet they struggle with the expectations of a conservative society that still pushes them in traditional roles.According to the 2025 gender gap index by the World Economic Forum, Japan ranked 118th among 148 countries, with female representation in the field of politics notably low.Leadership positions have traditionally been dominated by men and Japan has struggled to increase the number of female lawmakers and business leaders.The world's fourth largest economy ranks last among the G7 countries when it comes to the share of women in its national parliament.  Specifically, women make up about 15.7% of lawmakers in Japan, the lowest figure among the G7.It is even slow when it comes to women's reproductive health: only this week was it announced that the \"morning after\" pill - a form of emergency contraception available without prescription in more than 90 countries - had finally been approved for over the counter use in Japan.Even so, some see Takaichi's rise to power as a pivotal moment that could change how women view their prospects.\"There is great significance in Ms Takaichi becoming prime minister, with a broader impact on society,\" Naomi Koshi - who became the country's youngest female mayor in 2012 - told Japan's Kyodo news agency.Koshi argued Japan having a female prime minister will \"lower psychological barriers\" for women and girls, helping them feel it is normal to \"stand out\" as leaders in companies and society, even as gender-based stereotypes and expectations still remain.But Audrey Hill-Uekawa, 20, points out that, while it is remarkable Japan has its first female leader, one must remember it took her more than 30 years to get to that position.\"She's also not really going against the grain. She's saying the same thing as the men.\" Audrey Hill-Uekawa, 20, says the new prime minister's views don't differ much from the men who have gone beforeMs Hill-Uekawa adds that she shouldn't be put on a pedestal simply because she is a woman.\"We need to make sure we're talking about her policies. We need to be able to criticise her equally as everyone else.\"It is not just what Takaichi has said which has led people to label her as a defender of the patriarchy.It's also evident by who her champions inside the party have been.She's the protégé of the late former hawkish prime minister Shinzo Abe, and was backed in the leadership election by Taro Aso - a senior figure in the LDP at the head of one of the ruling party's most influential conservative blocs.His faction's support for Sanae Takaichi was pivotal in uniting the party's right wing behind her.\"I do feel that it is difficult for women to sort of relate to her success because it furthers this idea that we must be compliant with the status quo,\" 21-year-old Minori Konishi says.Ms Ogura agrees, saying that with her as a figurehead for women in politics, \"people are going to expect the same from us as well\".\"They're going to expect us to be compliant, not go against the ideals that they have, and it might make our job more difficult.\"Making history, however, was just the first of the challenges Takaichi will face - not least tackling a sluggish economy and inflation and winning back the trust of a frustrated and angry electorate, as well as hosting president Trump within days of taking power.It's safe to say that no-one expects gender equality issues to be high on her priority list.",

    "body": "US strikes on Latin American 'drug boats': What do we know, and are they legal?2 days agoMatt Murphy & Joshua CheethamBBC Verify   Donald Trump/Truth SocialUS officials say they have carried out a number of strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea, killing multiple drug traffickers. Announcing the first of these in September, President Donald Trump said his forces had destroyed a vessel that had departed from Venezuela. He said the boat was operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel and was carrying drugs bound for the US.Similar announcements have followed in recent weeks, accompanied with grainy footage but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking and few details about who or what was on board each vessel. Trump's officials say they are acting in self-defence by destroying boats carrying illicit drugs to the US but the strikes have attracted condemnation in the region.In one case, the Colombian president said a boat hit by the US was not Venezuelan, but \"Colombian with Colombian citizens inside\" - which the White House denied.After the first of the strikes, BBC Verify spoke to a range of experts in international and maritime law, with several saying that the US may have acted illegally in attacking the vessel.What does international law say?The US is not a signatory to United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but the US military's legal advisors have previously said that the US should \"act in a manner consistent with its provisions\". Under the convention, countries agree not to interfere with vessels operating in international waters. There are limited exceptions to this which allow a state to seize a ship, such as a \"hot pursuit\" where a vessel is chased from a country's waters into the high seas.\"Force can be used to stop a boat but generally this should be non-lethal measures,\" Prof Luke Moffett of Queens University Belfast said.Prof Moffett added that the use of aggressive tactics must be \"reasonable and necessary in self-defence where there is immediate threat of serious injury or loss of life to enforcement officials\", noting that the US moves were likely \"unlawful under the law of the sea\".Are US strikes on alleged cartel members legal?Experts have also questioned whether the killing of the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua cartel could contravene international law on the use of force.Under Article 2(4) of the UN charter, countries can resort to force when under attack and deploying their military in self-defence. Trump has previously accused the Tren de Aragua cartel of conducting irregular warfare against the US, and the state department has designated the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation. After the first strike, Prof Michael Becker of Trinity College Dublin told BBC Verify that the American action \"stretches the meaning of the term beyond its breaking point\".\"The fact that US officials describe the individuals killed by the US strike as narco-terrorists does not transform them into lawful military targets,\" Prof Becker said. \"The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela or the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation.\"Prof Moffett added: \"Labelling everyone a terrorist does not make them a lawful target and enables states to side-step international law.\"A memo sent to the US Congress, which was leaked, reportedly said the Trump administration had determined the US was in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels.Donald Trump/Truth SocialTrump posted a video on social media which he said showed the moment of the first strike Responding to a fifth strike in October, Dame Law School Prof Mary Ellen O'Connell told BBC Verify that \"no credible facts or legal principles have come to light to justify these attacks\".\"The only relevant law for peace is international law - that is the law of treaties, human rights and statehood,\" Prof O'Connell wrote in an emailed statement. But US officials including Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth have defended the action, which has also been applauded by Republicans in Congress. Asked about the same strike, a White House official told BBC Verify that Trump had authorised it after the boat left Venezuela crewed by Tren de Aragua members. The official added that the president was committed to using all means to prevent drugs reaching the US.The Pentagon declined to share the legal advice it obtained before carrying out the strike.In one strike, carried out on 16 October, there were two survivors - a Colombian and an Ecuadorian, who the US government says were repatriated for \"detention and prosecution\".Getty ImagesRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham has defended the strikesCan Trump launch attacks without congressional approval?Questions have also been raised as to whether the White House complied with US law in authorising the strikes. The US constitution says that only Congress has the power to declare war.However, Article II - which lays out the president's powers - says that \"the president shall be Commander in Chief of the Army\" and some constitutional experts have suggested that this grants the president the power to authorise strikes against military targets. Trump administration sources have previously cited this provision when defending US strikes on Iran.But it is unclear whether that provision extends to the use of force against non-state actors such as drug cartels.Rumen Cholakov, an expert in US constitutional law at King's College London, told BBC Verify that since 9/11, US presidents have relied on the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military Force Act (AUMF) when carrying out strikes against groups responsible for the attacks.\"Its scope has been expanded consistently in subsequent administrations,\" he added. \"It is not immediately obvious that drug cartels such as Tren de Aragua would be within the President's AUMF powers, but that might be what 'narco-terrorists' is hinting at.\"Questions also remain as to whether Trump complied with the War Powers Resolution, which demands that the president \"in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities\".Despite some Republicans in Congress reportedly having anxieties about the strikes, the Senate defeated a resolution in October that would have required the Trump administration to seek the approval of Congress before any further attacks.What do we know about US operations in the region?Venezuela's government has reacted to the strikes with anger. Its president, Nicolas Maduro, denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking.The strikes come amid reports that the US has deployed naval warships to the region in support of anti-narcotics operations against Venezuela.Using satellite imagery, images from social media, and information from publicly available trackers on vessels, we've identified 14 US military ships in the region. These include guided missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.We also located a number of military planes and drones in Puerto Rico.Trump also acknowledged in October that he has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela. The president - who has long sought to oust Maduro - has authorised a US$50m reward for any information leading to his arrest. The Venezuelan leader claimed victory in last year's elections, widely viewed as rigged by international observers.Additional reporting by Lucy Gilder ",

    "body": "Mosquitoes have been found in Iceland for the first time after the country experienced record-breaking heat this spring.Insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason encountered the mosquitoes over several nights last week while using wine-soaked ropes to observe moths, local media reported.Mr Hjaltason found two female mosquitoes and one male which were later confirmed to be Culiseta annulata, one of few species that can successfully survive winter.Iceland was one of only two mosquito-free havens in the world prior to the discovery, partly due to its cold climate. The only other recorded mosquito-free zone is Antarctica.The mosquitoes were found in Kjós, a glacial valley to the South West of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik.Mr Hjaltason shared the news of his discovery on a Facebook page for local wildlife alongside pictures of the insects, describing \"a strange fly on a red wine ribbon\", according to Icelandic media.\"I could tell right away that this was something I had never seen before\" he said in the post, which was screenshotted and shared by Iceland's Morgunblaðið news site, adding \"the last fortress seems to have fallen.\"Mr Hjaltason sent the insects to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History to be identified, where entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson confirmed his suspicions.The species are common across parts of Europe and North Africa but it it isn't clear how they reached Iceland, Alfreðsson told CNN. Iceland's cold climate and lack of stagnant water in which the insects can breed are key contributors to the country's former lack of mosquitoes, the World Population Review said.But this year, the country broke multiple records for its high temperatures. Typically, Iceland rarely experiences highs of more than 20C (68F) in May, and when it does those heatwaves will last for no more than two to three days, its Met Office notes. That threshold was exceeded for 10 consecutive days this year in different parts of the country, though.Iceland also saw its hottest ever day in May, with temperatures reaching 26.6C (79.8F) at Eglisstaðir Airport.A June study published by the Global Heat Health Information Network noted that such shifts could have \"significant\" impacts on delicate ecosystems, which have adapted to the cold climate and are sensitive to temperature shifts.Last year was the world's hottest on record, and the UN's climate body has established that human influence has \"unequivocally\" warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land.Further monitoring will be required in spring to see if the mosquito species has \"truly become established in Iceland\", Alfreðsson added.Hjaltason, meanwhile, has speculated on the origin of the specimens he observed.\"One always suspects Grundartangi - it's only about six kilometers from me, and things often arrive with ships and containers, so it's possible something came in that way,\" he told Morgunblaðið.\"But if three of them came straight into my garden, there were probably more.\"",

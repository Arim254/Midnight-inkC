Despite immediate rescue efforts, the three individuals were found dead,\"  a police statement said.The fatalities follow a deadly week in the alps.Last weekend in France, six skiers died after being caught in avalanches in various Alpine resorts and in western Austria, a 58-year-old skier died in in the Tyrolean resort of Weerberg.On Tuesday, an avalanche killed a 13-year-old Czech boy skiing in Austria's Bad Gastein resort.And in neighbouring Switzerland, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing on Friday.",

    "body": "1 hour agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan CorrespondentandDearbail Jordan,Reporter Watch: Firefighters battle deadly blaze at Karachi shopping centreA fire at a shopping centre in the Pakistan city of Karachi has killed six people as firefighters continue to battle the blaze.Parts of the Gul Plaza, containing 1,200 stores and spanning 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft), have collapsed which officers said was hampering rescue efforts.One firefighter is among the dead, more than 20 people have been injured and there are fears some are still trapped inside the multi-storey mall.Local emergency services said that when helpers arrived at the site on Saturday \"the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames\".A senior police official told the BBC that the authorities had been unable to search the building for bodies as the fire has continued to burn. More than 30 people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing.Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further.Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the shopping centre contains flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, carpets and perfume. Summaiya Syed, Karachi's police surgeon, said six bodies had been transferred to the city's Civil Hospital as well as some of the injured.She added that the police were \"invoking mass disaster protocols\".Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.",

    "body": "2 days agoMaia DaviesBBC NewsWatch: What Machado and Trump have said about Nobel Peace Prize medal exchangeVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country \"when the right time comes\".\"There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president,\" she told Fox News.Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom.The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges. EPA/ShutterstockMachado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday However, Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president and who on Friday held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA \"at President Trump's direction\" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official.\"Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries,\" the US official said.Asked on Friday about his decision to work with Rodríguez over Machado, Trump told reporters his decision had been informed by the US experience in Iraq more than 20 years ago. Security and political structures were dismantled after the US invaded, setting the scene for insurgency and the eventual emergence of the Islamic State group.\"If you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired - every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired - and they ended up being ISIS... I remember that,\" he said.Speaking later at an event in Washington, Machado said she was confident there would be an \"orderly transition\" in her country.\"The result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela that will be the best ally the US has ever had in the Americas,\" she said.\"This has nothing to do with a tension between Delcy Rodríguez and myself, this is about a criminal structure - that is the regime - and the Venezuelan people,\" she added, describing herself as \"just one member of a movement of millions of Venezuelans\".Meanwhile, in Venezuela's capital Caracas, Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president.She said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically, through political dialogue\".Rodríguez also said Venezuela needed to defend its \"dignity and honour\", and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment in a step away from Maduro's policies.Trump called Rodríguez a \"terrific person\" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called \"productive and courteous\".The following day, the US president called Machado a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much\", describing her gift of the Nobel Peace Prize medal as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect\".Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal on Thursday",

I will be more careful with my words and behaviour,\" Yamanaka said.He said those comments were made during discussions over personnel evaluations.However, the mayor denied other accusations, including insulting colleagues' appearance.Yamanaka said an investigation was being considered under the supervision of the deputy mayor, adding that he would co-operate \"sincerely\" if an investigation takes place.In response, Kubota insisted Yamanaka had made the comments he has not admitted to, saying: \"The mayor doesn't understand anything. I cannot accept that as an apology. I want him to change.\"More from the BBC",

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US president Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely-used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.On Friday, Judge Katherine Menendez ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

    "body": "Syrian troops fighting Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria have seized the country's largest oilfield.The Omar facility and nearby gas fields are under army control after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) pulled back, officials and monitors say. Earlier the army captured the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river.The push came after the SDF announced it would redeploy east of the Euphrates, following deadly clashes last week. That withdrawal followed talks with US officials.Ongoing fighting in the area stems from the breakdown of an agreement between SDF and the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is seeking to integrate Kurdish bodies into Syrian institutions.On Friday, in an apparent good-will gesture, al-Sharaa said he would make Kurdish a national language and make the Kurdish new year an official holiday. The decree is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946.The US-backed SDF then announced its pullout east of the Euphrates river. Kurdish forces have been controlling swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and north-east, much of it gained during the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.Over the weekend, Syrian troops continued their eastward push. They entered the town of Tabqa on the south-western bank of the Euphrates and nearby dam on Saturday.On Sunday, Syrian officials announced they had seized Omar, Syria's largest oil field, on the eastern side of the river. The facility has been a major source of revenue for the SDF.This claim was supported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. It said the SDF had withdrawn from \"entire villages and towns of the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor [province]\" as well as the Omar and Tanak oil fields early on Sunday.Meanwhile Syrian authorities accused the SDF of blowing up two bridges on the Euphrates River, including the new al-Rashid bridge in the city of Raqqa.Last week at least 12 people were reported killed in clashes between the two sides in the northern city of Aleppo.The latest fighting comes despite attempts by the US to broker a ceasefire. Washington has long backed the SDF, but it also supports the Syrian government.Following the ousting of longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, President al-Sharaa has been seeking to integrate Kurdish military and civilian bodies into Syria's national institutions.In March 2025, the SDF signed a deal with the government to that effect. Almost a year on, the agreement is still not implemented, with each side blaming the other.",

    "body": "2 days agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoGoogle has appealed a US district judge's landmark antitrust ruling that found the company illegally held a monopoly in online search.\"As we have long said, the Court's August 2024 ruling ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they're forced to,\" Google's vice president for regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said.In its announcement on Friday, Google said the ruling by Judge Amit Mehta didn't account for the pace of innovation and intense competition the company faces.The company is requesting a pause on implementing a series of fixes - viewed by some observers as too lenient - aimed at limiting its monopoly power.Judge Mehta acknowledged the rapid changes to the Google's business when he issued his remedies in September, writing that the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) had changed the course of the case.He refused to grant government lawyers their request for a Google breakup that would include a spin-off of Chrome, the world's most popular browser.Instead, he pushed less rigorous remedies, including a requirement that Google share certain data with \"qualified competitors\" as deemed by the court.That data was due to include portions of its search index, Google's massive inventory of web content that functions like a map of the internet.The judge also called for Google to allow certain competitors to display the tech giant's search results as their own in a bid to give upstarts the time and resources they need to innovate.On Friday, Mulholland balked at being forced to share search data and syndication services with rivals as she justified the request for a halt to implementing the orders.\"These mandates would risk Americans' privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products — ultimately stifling the innovation that keeps the U.S. at the forefront of global technology,\" Mulholland wrote.While the company has invested growing sums of cash into AI, those ambitions have come under scrutiny.Last month, the EU opened an investigation into Google over its AI summaries which appear above search results.The European Commission said it would probe whether Google used data from websites to provide the service and failed to offer appropriate compensation to publishers.Google said the investigation risked stifling innovation in a competitive market.This week, Google parent Alphabet became the fourth company ever to reach a market capitalisation of $4tn.",

    "body": "20 hours agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", and blamed the US for the deaths.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.\"Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand,\" Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media.\"We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation.\"The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "From camouflage to tracksuits - Guinea's junta leader becomes civilian president1 day agoDamian ZaneGuinea PresidencyOfficial pictures of Mamadi Doumbouya have portrayed him in a more relaxed modeFrom the moment he seized power in September 2021 Guinea's Mamadi Doumbouya struck an imposing figure.Just 36 years old at the time, the broad-shouldered colonel, standing at well over six feet (1.8m), wearing military fatigues, mirrored sunglasses and a red beret certainly made an impression when announcing the coup.A relatively unknown member of an elite army unit, he declared that the government of ousted President Alpha Condé had disregarded democratic principles and that citizens' rights were being trampled on.After more than four years of acting as interim president, and going back on a promise not to run for leadership of the country, Doumbouya, now 41, was sworn in as the elected head of state on Saturday.The discreet, disciplined and private man won 87% of the vote in December's election against a severely depleted field.Ex-Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, now in exile, described the process as a charade which generated \"fabricated\" results.While seemingly enjoying some popular support, critics have questioned Doumbouya's democratic credentials as some political parties have been banned, activists have mysteriously disappeared and media outlets been shut down.ReutersVideo footage shot in the aftermath of the 2021 coup showed Doumbouya being greeted by enthusiastic crowdsScrolling back through the social media accounts from the president's office there is a sense of a carefully curated image.The army man, now a general, has, for the main, ditched the camouflage in favour of the baseball cap and tracksuit, or a boubou - traditional Guinean attire of loose-fitting robes with elaborate embroidery. The shades though are still at times in evidence.Pictures show him at the opening of schools, or transport and mining infrastructure or cycling through the streets of the capital, Conakry. The message is clear: this is a man of action who is working on behalf of the people.\"This was presenting an image of someone who can be close to civilians, someone who is a civilian leader and can be representative of the people,\" Beverly Ochieng, senior analyst with Dakar-based security intelligence firm Control Risks, told the BBC.\"In some ways this is distancing himself from what brought him to power – a coup - and the fact that his entire career has been in the military.\"In the 15 years before he took power, Doumbouya gained extensive international experience, including being educated to master's level in France and serving in the French Foreign Legion. He was also in Afghanistan, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Central African Republic and worked on close protection in Israel, Cyprus and the UK.But the donning of civilian clothes may not be entirely sincere, according to some analysts.\"I'm not sure that he has transitioned from a military man. I think that the military costume will remain even if he is conducting the return to civilian order,\" argued Aïssatou Kanté, a researcher in the West Africa office of the Institute of Security Studies.She referred to a ban on political demonstrations, the exclusion of Doumbouya's main challengers in December's election and the suspension of key opposition parties.Human rights campaigners have demanded to know the whereabouts of two activists - Oumar Sylla (known as Foniké Menguè) and Mamadou Billo Bah – who have not been seen since July 2024. They suspect the men were taken by the military.Press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders has also expressed concern that journalist Habib Marouane Camara has been missing for more than a year. It has described how journalists are now censoring themselves and are fearful about what might happen to them.Nevertheless, the 2021 coup was widely welcomed in the country and since then Doumbouya appears to have remained a popular figure.Polling organisation Afrobarometer found that between 2022 and 2024 the proportion of people who trusted the president either \"partially\" or \"a lot\" grew from 46% to 53%.Guinea PresidencyDoumbouya (R) welcomed Rwandan President Paul Kagame to the country in November for the start of operations at the Simandou iron-ore mineThe president-elect may not have a clearly defined ideology guiding him but for Kanté his emphasis on Guineans being in control of their own destiny has become very important.\"It's what keeps coming up in official speeches - this affirmation of political and economic sovereignty,\" she told the BBC.In his address to the nation a few days into the new year, he struck a conciliatory tone, calling on all Guineans to build a nation of peace and \"fully assumed\" sovereignty.In a country that continues to grapple with high levels of poverty despite plentiful natural resources – including the world's largest reserves of bauxite, which is used to make aluminium - this idea strikes a chord.The government's messaging on the development of the vast iron-ore resources in Simandou underscores the possible benefits for the people.The three billion tonnes of ore available in a remote southern part of the country, which began to be exported last month, could transform the global iron market, as well as Guinea's fortunes.The authorities say earnings from the project, partly owned by Chinese miners as well as the British-Australian corporation Rio Tinto, will be invested in new transport infrastructure as well as health and education.The success or otherwise of Simandou may define Doumbouya's presidency.AFP via Getty ImagesIn 2021, Doumbouya wore formal military dress when he was sworn in as interim leaderHe appears determined to keep some of the processing and added-value parts of the industry in Guinea to ensure greater benefits.Across the broader mining sector, his government has cancelled dozens of contracts over the past year where it was felt that the companies were not investing in Guinea – a move that has led one UAE-based firm to take the country to an international court.\"This move towards resource nationalism makes him look like a local hero. He looks like he's really fighting for the rights of his citizens, even if that means business disruptions,\" said analyst Ochieng.The emphasis on sovereignty has also led to a pragmatic approach to international relations, observers say. Unlike coup leaders elsewhere in West Africa, Doumbouya has not outrightly rejected the former colonial power France in favour of Russia.Neither, despite his background in France and having a French wife, has he been accused of being a puppet of Paris.Doumbouya very much wants to be seen as someone running things in the interests of the country.The president has preached a message of national unity and will hope that he can usher in a new era of prosperity for Guinea.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "description": "Myanmar has denied committing genocide against the Ronhingya people, saying The Gambia has failed to provide enough proof, as it begun its defence at ",
    "body": "Myanmar has denied committing genocide against the Ronhingya people, saying The Gambia has failed to provide enough proof, as it begun its defence at the UN's top court.Ko Ko Hlaing, a Myanmar government representative, told judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the allegation was \"unsubstantiated\".Earlier this week, The Gambia's foreign minister Dawda Jallow told the court Myanmar wanted to erase the minority Muslim population through its use of \"genocidal policies\".Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during an army crackdown in Myanmar in 2017.A damning report issued by the UN the following year said top military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocide in Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas.Myanmar - which has been under military control since it overthrew the civilian government in 2021 - rejected the report and has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats.On Friday, Hlaning told the ICJ that \"Myanmar was not obliged to remain idle and allow terrorists to have free reign of northern Rakhine states\", where the majority of Rohingya lived.\"These attacks were the reasons for the clearance operations, which is a military term referring to counter-insurgency or counter-terrorism operations,\" Hlaing said.The Gambia launched its case against Myanmar in 2019, with Jallow telling the ICJ it did so out of a \"sense of responsibility\" following its own experience with a military government.Jallow told the court on Monday that the Rohingya \"had suffered decades of appalling persecution and years of dehumanising propaganda\", which was followed by the military crackdown and \"continual genocidal policies meant to erase their existence in Myanmar\".Lawyers for the Muslim-majority West African country also argued that the killing of women, children and the elderly, along with the destruction of their villages, was hard to justify under combatting terrorism. \"When the court considers... all of the evidence taken together, the only reasonable conclusion to reach is that a genocidal intent permeated and informed Myanmar's myriad of state-led actions against the Rohingya,\" said Philippe Sands, arguing for The Gambia, which has the backing of 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in its action.More than a million Rohingya refugees now live across the border in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar region alone - some of the largest and most densely populated camps in the world, according to the UN's refugee agency.Hlaing - the Myanmar government representative - said on Friday that it was committed to \"achieving the repatriation to Myanmar of persons from Rakhine State currently living in camps in Bangladesh\". But he also said external forces, such as Covid-19, had hampered those efforts.\"Myanmar's commitment and constant efforts since 2017 contradict Gambia's narrative that Myanmar's intention is to destroy or forcibly deport this population,\" Hlaing told the court.He added that \"a finding of genocide would place an indelible stain on my country and its people\", so the outcome was of \"fundamental importance for my country's reputation and future\".The court has also set aside three days to hear from witnesses, including Rohingya survivors, but these sessions will be closed to the public and media.A final ruling is expected towards the end of 2026, Reuters news agency reported.It is expected to set a precedent in other genocide cases, including one brought by South Africa against Israel over the war in Gaza, as it is the first to be heard in more than a decade - and is being seen as an opportunity for ICJ judges to refine rules around the definition of genocide.The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which The Gambia accuses Myanmar of breaching in its treatment of the Rohingya, was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. It defines genocide as crimes committed \"with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".",

    "body": "2 days agoLaura Bicker,Beijing ,Suranjana Tewari,Singapore ,Koh Ewe,SingaporeandJessica Murphy,TorontoReutersMark Carney's visit to China is the first by a Canadian leader in nearly a decadeChinese leader Xi Jinping and Canadian PM Mark Carney have announced lower tariffs, signalling a reset in their countries' relationship after a key meeting in Beijing.China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.  He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's  biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\".He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\".\"We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be,\" he said when asked about China's human rights record.Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all.And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor.Carney said the \"world has changed dramatically\" and how Canada positions itself \"will shape our future for decades to come,\" he added. Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a \"new world order\". He later added that the multilateral system had been \"eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut\". As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: \"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.\" Getty ImagesCarney in the Great Hall of the People during the meeting with Xi  A trade reset Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs.Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025.In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate.The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs.As well as relief for canola producers, there will also be reduced tariffs on Canadian lobsters, crabs, and peas.China is Canada's second-largest trading partner but it's still a long way behind the US in volume.Economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney. On arrival in Beijing on Wednesday, he met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant.On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation.The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.A frosty history The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017.That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer  at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US.Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied.Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021.Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also \"managing leverage\".Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as \"extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage\".\"That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline,\" he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media.Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a \"narrower, more specific\" manner.\"We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ,\" he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in \"broad discussions\". Canada and China have \"different systems\", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. \"But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoEd Habershon,JohannesburgandNatasha BootyThe US has accused South Africa's defence ministry of refusing to obey orders from its own government to send home Iranian warships that have been conducting naval exercises in the African country's waters. \"South Africa can't lecture the world on 'justice' while cozying up to Iran,\" it said in a statement.In response, South Africa's defence ministry said it was launching an inquiry to get to the root of these \"serious allegations\".Washington has criticised South Africa for inviting Iran at a time when a brutal crackdown against protests was happening in the Middle Eastern country. It said the South African military's actions did not amount to \"non-alignment\" but were instead a \"choice to stand with Iran\". \"This is absolutely no surprise. Protests against the Iranian regime are happening right now, human rights organisations here in SA have been calling for support for the protesters,\" William Gumede, an associate professor at the University of Witwatersrand, told the BBC. \"These are all democratic violations and human rights abuses and we have not heard a whimper from the ANC. That is the irony and hypocrisy, it's been criticising other regimes but it's been silent on what's happening in Iran.\"In the strongly worded statement posted on its social media accounts, the US embassy in South Africa said it noted with \"concern and alarm\" reports that the country's defence minister and its defence forces had defied government orders to ask Iran to leave. The US embassy said Iran's participation \"undermined maritime security and regional stability\" and was \"unconscionable\" as it suppressed protests back home, comparing them to \"peaceful political activity South Africans fought so hard to gain for themselves\". On Friday the office of Defence Minister Angie Motshekga said she \"would like to place it on record\" that President Cyril Ramaphosa's instructions had been \"clearly communicated to all parties concerned, agreed upon and to be implemented and adhered to as such\".Dubbed \"Peace Resolve\", the week-long naval drill got under way last Friday. It is being led by China - and involves other members from an alliance of major developing countries, including Russia, which when it was launched in 2006 was known as Bric.It took its acronym from its founding members Brazil, Russia, India and China - and when South Africa joined four years later an \"s\" was added to its name.With the recent addition of Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the alliance is now called Brics+ - and its aim is to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier Western nations.Iranian warships had already arrived in Cape Town when the order to turn them around reportedly came through.

    "body": "2 days agoPhilippa Roxby and Jim ReedHealth reportersGetty ImagesTaking paracetamol while pregnant is safe and there's no evidence it raises the risk of autism, ADHD and developmental issues in children, say experts behind a major new review.Pregnant women \"should feel reassured\" by the findings, they say, which contradict controversial claims from US President Donald Trump last year that paracetamol \"is no good\" and pregnant women should \"fight like hell\" not to take it.His views were criticised at the time by medical organisations worldwide. Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety.But US health officials maintain that \"many experts\" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy.The US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol - known as acetaminophen in the US - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy.Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research.Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Women's Health, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't.The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review \"gold-standard\".The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link.\"When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism,\" lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC.\"The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" she added.This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller.Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says.\"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever,\" said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London.Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies.Medical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women.Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers \"do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health\".\"I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close,\" she said.Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was \"well-conducted\" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses.According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides \"strong evidence\" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and \"should effectively put this question to rest\".It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones.Getty ImagesIn a speech in September 2025, President Trump said his administration was linking paracetamol (or acetaminophen) to autism and urging pregnant women to largely avoid the pain relieverA spokesman from the US Department of Health and Human Services said \"many experts\" had expressed concern over the use of acetaminophen - the US name for paracetamol - during pregnancy.For example, a review in August 2025 led by Dr Andrew Baccarelli, dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that using acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase children's autism and ADHD risk, and urged caution over \"especially heavy or prolonged use\".Months earlier, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had pledged to find out the cause of a steep rise in reported autism cases.In a controversial speech in the Oval Office in September, the US president said doctors would be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever to pregnant women. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, while also saying it was still the only drug approved for treating fevers during pregnancy.On its website, the FDA says \"a causal relationship\" between the drug and neurological conditions \"has not been established\". Health officials in the UK have stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women.",

    "body": "2 days agoJamie WhiteheadBBC News ReutersCIA director John Ratcliffe met Venezuela's Interim President Delcy Rodríguez in Caracas on Thursday \"at President Trump's direction,\" a US official has said. The two-hour meeting was aimed at building trust and communication following the US seizure of Venezuela's former president Nicolás Maduro almost two weeks ago. Ratcliffe and Rodríguez discussed potential economic collaboration and that \"Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries\", according to the US official.The meeting took place on the same day Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president, where she announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment - a move away from Maduro's policies. During her speech to the nation, Rodríguez said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically through political dialogue,\" adding Venezuela had to defend its \"dignity and honour\".President Donald Trump has said US oil companies will move into Venezuela and make money that will go to people there and to the US, with a top official saying the US would control sales of sanctioned Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\".Trump has asked oil companies to invest at least $100bn (£75bn) in Venezuela, but one executive said last week the country is currently \"uninvestable\".Rodríguez, the former vice-president, was sworn in on 5 January after US forces seized Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in an operation in Caracas. They are now detained in New York, where they have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges.The US official described the meeting between Rodríguez and Ratcliffe as \"historic\", adding that Ratcliffe was the first cabinet-level official to travel to Venezuela.The meeting also happened on the same day that Trump met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in Washington, who presented the US president with her Nobel Peace Prize winning medal. In her state of the union address, Rodríguez told Venezuelans it was \"very difficult\" to deliver Maduro's annual report, saying that the two were working on the speech together until six hours before his seizure on 3 January.Noting the US is a nuclear power, the interim president said she was not afraid to engage in diplomacy, saying \"we have to go together as Venezuelans to defend sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and also defend our dignity and our honour\".She continued that if she needed to travel to Washington DC to meet with Trump, she would do so \"walking on her feet, not dragged there\". She added that \"all of Venezuela is threatened\", and called for national unity to \"wage the diplomatic battle\".In her address, Rodríguez announced the proposal to reform the country's hydrocarbon law, saying she had asked the legislative body to approve it.Until now, Venezuela's hydrocarbon law has stated foreign partners must work with the country's state-owned oil and gas company, PDVSA - which must hold a majority stake. The reforms, Rodríguez said, would allow investment to flow to new fields. She said she had instructed her government to create two sovereign funds - one for social protection so that \"foreign currency goes directly to hospitals, schools, food, housing\" and the second for infrastructure and social development to invest in water, electricity and roads.Venezuela has been facing an economic crisis, with a sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. Before the US operation to seize Maduro, Venezuelans told the BBC they were concerned about what they were going to eat.\"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive,\" one man said. Rodríguez's reforms come as Trump and American investors eye opportunity in Venezuela, which holds the world's largest proven oil reserves.Bosses of the biggest US oil firms who attended a meeting at the White House last week acknowledged that Venezuela represented an enticing opportunity.But they said significant changes would be needed to make the region an attractive investment.Trump said his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate.\"You're dealing with us directly. You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela,\" he said.Trump also said that \"one of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices\".Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since crude oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago.Chevron is the last remaining major American oil company still operating in the country.Watch: BBC Verify examines claims Venezuela \"stole\" US oil",

    "body": "'Young 40s': Gen Z has found a new way to mock millennials for their style in South Korea17 hours agoHyojung KimBBC KoreanInstagram/@detailanceJi says he has become more self-conscious interacting with younger colleaguesJi Seung-ryeol, 41, prides himself on his sense of fashion. He diligently shares mirror selfies on Instagram, where everyone knows the more likes you get, the cooler you are.  So he was bewildered to find out that men his age have become the subject of ridicule online, mocked for shoehorning their way into styles associated with Gen Z and younger millennials.AI-generated caricatures of this demographic have gone viral on social media: a middle-aged man decked out in street wear and clutching an iPhone. The kids call them \"Young 40s\".The memes have made Ji's beloved Nike Air Jordans and Stüssy T-shirts the butt of jokes—and the source of much indignation.\"I'm just buying and wearing things I've liked for a long time, now that I can afford them,\" he tells the BBC. \"Why is this something to be attacked for?\"The iPhone that started it allOnce celebrated as pioneers of taste in the 1990s, the tide of public opinion on 40-year-olds turned after the release of the iPhone 17 last September.The smartphone, long considered the preserve of the youth, was suddenly recast as a tacky trademark of Young 40s. These are, in the words of Gen Z Jeong Ju-eun, people \"trying too hard to look young\", who \"refuse to accept that time has passed\".The figures seem to reflect this shift. While the majority of young South Koreans still prefer the iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy, over the past year Apple's market share fell by 4% among Gen Z consumers and rose 12% for people in their 40s, according to research by Gallup.Something similar played out a few years back with Geriatric Millennials, born in the early '80s, whose brand of humour—the crying-laughing emoji, finger moustaches and the word \"adulting\"—was derided as cringey.Back then, debate over Geriatric Millennials sparked self-deprecating jokes, think pieces and quizzes dictating if you're meant to pile on the ribbing or be subjected to it.The same trends have taken hold in South Korea with Young 40s.News1The iPhone, long considered the preserve of young people, is now seen as a trademark of Young 40sIn Korea, age difference, even by a year, forms the basis of social hierarchy. Age is one of the first things strangers ask each other, setting the tone for future interactions: how they address one another, who gets to open the bottle of soju at parties (it's usually the oldest person) and which way to tip your shot glass (the correct answer: away from your seniors).But the Young 40 memes also represent Korean youth's growing scepticism of this almost forced reverence for elders.Just a few years ago, the term \"kkondae\" was another buzzword among young South Korean to describe an annoying breed of rigid, condescending elders.Such friction has been exacerbated by social media, where \"multiple generations mix within the same space\", says Lee Jae-in, a sociology professor at Korea University's Sejong campus.\"The old pattern where different generations consumed separate cultural spaces has largely disappeared,\" he adds.A self-conscious sandwich generationPopularised in marketing circles in the 2010s, the term \"Young 40\" originally referred to consumers with youthful sensibilities. They were health-conscious, active and comfortable with technology—an important target demographic for companies.\"In the past, people in their 40s were seen as already old,\" says Kim Yong-Sup, a trend analyst widely credited with coining the term \"Young 40\".As the median age of South Korea's society rose, however, these people were \"no longer on the verge of old age but at the centre of society\", he says.But the marketing term has since taken a viral, sardonic turn. Over the past year, \"Young 40\" was mentioned online more than 100,000 times - more than half the references were used in a negative context, according to analytics platform SomeTrend. Many of them appeared alongside words like \"old\" and \"disgusting\".An offshoot of the meme is Sweet Young 40, a sarcastic label for middle-aged men who like to hit on young women.Getty ImagesMany South Korean youth face soaring house prices and cut-throat competition in the job marketSome see the jokes about Young 40s as a form of punching up: these are people at the peak of their careers, who amassed wealth in a time of economic stability and a property boom.On the other side are Gen Z and young millennials, born a couple of decades later, who face soaring house prices and cut-throat competition in the job market. In their eyes, Young 40s represent \"the generation that made it through just before the door of opportunity closed\", according to psychologist Oh Eun-kyung.\"They are seen not simply as individuals with personal tastes, but as symbols of privilege and power,\" she says. \"That's why the energy of mockery is focused on them.\"But Ji, the 41-year-old fashion enthusiast who lived through the so-called golden era, tells a different version of that story.After experiencing the Asian financial crisis as a teen, Ji entered a tough job market in his 20s, submitting around 60-70 applications to land a job. His generation is one that \"had very little to enjoy growing up, and only began to enjoy things later, as adults\", he says.Instagram/@detailanceJi says he feels \"caught in between\" two generationsNow at the workplace, he often finds himself sandwiched between two worlds. The generation above him ran a \"strict, top-down system where you did what you were told\", while below him is \"a generation that asks 'why''\".\"We're a generation that has experienced both cultures. We feel caught in between.\"While the ability to straddle two generations was once a badge of honour, Ji says he has become self-conscious about interacting with younger colleagues for fear of being labelled a kkondae or Young 40.\"These days, I hardly organise drinking gatherings,\" he says. \"I try to keep conversations focused on work or career concerns, and only share personal stories when discussions naturally deepen.\"According to Kang, another fashionable 41-year-old, sitting at the heart of the Young 40 meme is a deeply human desire.\"As you get older, longing for youth becomes completely natural. Wanting to look young is something every generation shares.\"",

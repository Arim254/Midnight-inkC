    "body": "2 days agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat, a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine, Europe and even China, do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment, the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".WPA Pool/Getty ImagesZelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: \"The only thing that will unarguably, undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack, and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend.\"This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia.Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently, I heard no mention of any Spring offensive, only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure.Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president, pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains, designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace.According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs, in this year, Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long, not least fighting with one hand behind their back,' says Fiona HillFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, who served on Trump's national security council during his first term, says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. \"Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe,\" she says. \"Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.\"Trade, sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly, Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%, interest rates 16%, growth slowed, budget deficits soaring, real incomes plunging, consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. \"The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022,\" the authors say.But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking, not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions, such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via ReutersIn this year alone, Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded, according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi, said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would, he said, work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies.Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy, it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. \"We need to stop being cute and go full embargo,\" he said. \"We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention.\"In theory, sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October, a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt \"very tired\" of the conflict, up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy. ReutersThe Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called \"reparation loan\" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years.In Kyiv, officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held, has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday, the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court.Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns, such is its own vast debts, and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone.EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success.There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine, it could mobilise more of its armed forces.It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia), and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war, many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty ImagesUkraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed \"the fathers of the future\".This puzzles outsiders. \"I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people,\" one senior UK military figure told me. \"I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight.\"Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires, which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. \"Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].\"Strikes, diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles, it could hit Russia harder and deeper.This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. \"By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once.\"Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel.\"But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact, when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent? AFP via Getty ImagesAs well as defending its territory, Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan, former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. \"They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour, but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war.\"Dr Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure, as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. \"It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat,\" he said.More from InDepthThere's also - still - a diplomatic route.Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war, he may choose it.The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia, setting up negotiating teams, using its power to drive through agreement.\"The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia,\" Thomas Graham argues. \"One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.\"China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also hugely dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.ShutterstockPresident Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted, for transatlantic allies to be divided, and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated, if global markets were disrupted, if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy, then the thinking in Beijing might change.For now though, Putin believes he is sitting pretty, with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on, analysts say, the more Ukrainian morale will fall, the more divided its allies will become, and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin said last week.\"Nothing will change his position,\" Fiona Hill told me. \"Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.\"Top picture credit: Reuters BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "3 days agoAlex BoydGetty ImagesFive men have been arrested in Germany suspected of being involved in a plot to drive a vehicle into people at a Christmas market.Three Moroccans, an Egyptian and a Syrian were detained on Friday over the plan to target a market in the southern Bavarian state. Authorities said they suspected an \"Islamist motive\".Prosecutors said the Egyptian - a 56-year-old - was alleged to have \"called for a vehicle attack... with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible\". The Moroccans allegedly agreed to carry out the attack.Officials in Germany have been on high alert after previous attacks at Christmas markets, including in Magdeburg last December that killed six people.Authorities did not say when the planned attack was supposed to take place or which market was the target, though said they believed it to be one in the Dingolfing-Landau area, north east of Munich.German newspaper Bild reported the Egyptian man was an imam at a mosque in the area.Police said the Moroccan men - aged 30, 28 and 22 - were arrested accused of having agreed to commit murder, while the Syrian man, a 37-year-old, was accused of encouraging the suspects \"in their decision to commit the crime\".The five suspects appeared before a magistrate on Saturday and remain in custody.Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria's state interior minister, told Bild the \"excellent cooperation between our security services\" had helped to prevent \"a potentially Islamist-motivated attack\".Christmas markets are popular festive attractions throughout Germany, frequently attracting large crowds and significant tourism.Security at events has been increased in recent years, since an attack in Berlin in 2016 when a man drove a lorry into a market crowd, killing 12 people.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLaura GozziFootage supplied by the team of scientists show the scale of the footprints and a recreation of how they were formedThousands of dinosaur footprints dating back 210 million years have been found in a national park in northern Italy.The footprints - some of which are up to 40cm (15in) in diameter - are aligned in parallel rows, and many show clear traces of toes and claws. It is thought the dinosaurs were prosauropods - herbivores with long necks, small heads and sharp claws. \"I never would have imagined I'd come across such a spectacular discovery in the region where I live,\" said Milan-based paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso.Illustrazione di Fabio Manucci, Arch. PaleoStelvioArtist's rendition of a herd of prosauropods walking across a muddy plain during low tide. Smaller footprints suggest the herd also included young specimensLast September a photographer spotted the footprints stretching hundreds of metres on a vertical mountain wall in the Stelvio national park, north-east of Milan.In the Triassic period - between about 250 and 201 million years ago - the wall was a tidal flat, which later became part of the Alpine chain.\"This place was full of dinosaurs; it's an immense scientific treasure,\" Mr Dal Sasso said.The herds moved in harmony, he added, \"and there are also traces of more complex behaviours, like groups of animals gathering in a circle, perhaps for the purposes of defence.\"The prosauropods, which could be up to 10m (33ft) long,  walked on two legs but in some cases handprints were found in front of footprints, indicating that they probably stopped and rested their forelimbs on the ground.Elio Della Ferrera, Arch. PaleoStelvioPhotographer Elio Della Ferrera snapped the first picture of the mountain wall showing the footprintsElio Della Ferrera, the photographer who discovered the site, said he hoped the discovery would \"spark reflection in all of us, highlighting how little we know about the places we live in: our home, our planet\".According to a press release from the Italian culture ministry, the area is remote and not accessible by paths, so drones and remote sensing technology will be employed instead.The Stelvio national park is located in the Fraele valley by Italy's border with Switzerland, near where the Winter Olympics will take place next year. \"It's as if history itself wanted to pay homage to the greatest global sporting event, combining past and present in a symbolic passing of the baton between nature and sport,\" said the Italian Ministry of Culture.",

    "body": "6 hours agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentThe European Commission has watered down its plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035.Current rules state that new vehicles sold from that date should be \"zero emission\", but carmakers, particularly in Germany, have lobbied heavily for concessions.Under the European Commission's new plan, 90% of new cars sold from 2035 would have to be zero-emission, rather than 100%.According to the European carmakers association, ACEA, market demand for electric cars is currently too low, and without a change to the rules, manufacturers would risk \"multi-billion euro\" penalties.The remaining 10% could be made up of conventional petrol or diesel cars, along with hybrids.Carmakers will be expected to use low-carbon steel made in the EU in the vehicles they produce.The Commission also expects an increase in the use of biofuels and so-called e-fuels, which are synthesised from captured carbon dioxide, to compensate for the extra emissions created by petrol and diesel vehicles. Opponents of the move have warned that it risks undermining the transition towards electric vehicles and leaving the EU exposed in the face of foreign competition.The green transport group T&E has warned that the UK should not follow the EU's lead by weakening its own plans to phase out the sale of conventional cars under the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate.\"The UK must stand firm. Our ZEV mandate is already driving jobs, investment and innovation into the UK. As major exporters we cannot compete unless we innovate, and global markets are going electric fast,\" said T&E UK's director Anna Krajinska.Ahead of the announcement, Sigrid de Vries, director general at ACEA, said that \"flexibility\" for manufacturers was \"urgent\".\"2030 is around the corner, and market demand is too low to avoid the risk of multi-billion-euro penalties for manufacturers,\" she said.\"It will take time to build the charging points and introduce fiscal and purchase incentives to get the market on track. Policy makers must provide breathing space to manufacturers to sustain jobs, innovation and investments.\"Carmakers in the UK have previously called for better incentives to encourage drivers to buy electric ahead of the government's planned ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.Firms across the world have been changing their production lines and investing billions as governments try to persuade people to drive greener cars to meet environmental targets.Volvo said it had \"built a complete EV portfolio in less than 10 years\" and was prepared to go fully electric, using hybrids as a transition. It argued if it can move away from petrol and diesel vehicles, other companies should be able to as well.The carmaker said: \"Weakening long-term commitments for short-term gain risks undermining Europe's competitiveness for years to come. \"A consistent and ambitious policy framework, as well as investments in public infrastructure, is what will deliver real benefits for customers, for the climate, and for Europe's industrial strength.\"However, German carmaker Volkswagen welcomed the European Commission's draft proposal on new CO₂ targets, calling it \"economically sound overall\".It said: \"The fact that small electric vehicles are to receive special support in future is very positive. It is extremely important that the CO₂ targets for 2030 are made more flexible for passenger cars and adjusted for light commercial vehicles.\"Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions.\"Colin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank, said the UK having \"stable policy\" would give companies the confidence to invest in charging infrastructure and avoid \"jeopardising investments\".\"It was government policy that saw Sunderland chosen to build Nissan's original electric Leaf, and today the latest Nissan EV has started rolling off the production lines in the North East, securing jobs for years to come,\" he said.Octopus Electric Vehicles chief executive Fiona Howarth warned that if the UK reduced its goals because of changes in Brussels, it would send a \"damaging signal to investors, manufacturers and supply-chain partners\".Many of these groups have already invested heavily in the transition \"on the assumption the UK would stay the course,\" she said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNardine Saad,Los AngelesandRegan MorrisReutersA California doctor who sold ketamine to Friends star Matthew Perry has been sentenced to eight months of home detention and three years of supervised release, making him the second person to be sentenced in the actor's death.Dr Mark Chavez is among five people - including another doctor and a dealer known as the Ketamine Queen - who have pleaded guilty to drug-related charges stemming from sitcom star's 2023 death at his Los Angeles home.The San Diego-based physician admitted to obtaining ketamine from his clinic and a wholesale distributor through a fraudulent prescription and sold it to Dr Salvador Plasencia, who supplied the dissociative anaesthetic to Perry. Plasencia was sentenced earlier this month to 30 months in prison.The multiyear federal investigation into Perry's death examined how the Emmy-winning actor acquired ketamine through an underground drug network in Hollywood. Ketamine, a surgical anaesthetic, is used as a treatment for depression, anxiety and pain. Perry, who had battled drug addiction and depression, had been prescribed the drug as part of his treatment but soon started seeking more than what he was allotted.That ultimately led him to the drug ring that ensnared the two doctors, Perry's live-in assistant, a man named Erik Fleming and American-British dual-national Jasveen Sangha, the dealer known as the Ketamine Queen. The latter three are due to be sentenced in the coming months. A post-mortem examination of Perry found a high concentration of ketamine in his blood and determined that \"acute effects\" of the substance killed him.ReutersMark Chavez, a doctor accused of supplying ketamine to 'Friends' actor Matthew Perry before his death, arrives in federal court in Los Angeles, California, on 2 October 2024.Prosecutors said Perry's assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, worked with Chavez and Plasencia to provide the actor with more than $50,000 (£38,000) of ketamine in the weeks before his death.In his plea agreement, Chavez admitted that he obtained ketamine from both his former clinic and a wholesale distributor through a fraudulent prescription. He submitted a fraudulent prescription for 30 ketamine lozenges under a former patient's name -  without her knowledge or consent - to sell to Plasencia to give to Perry. He confessed to selling 22 vials of liquid ketamine and nine ketamine lozenges to Plasencia, according to his October 2024 plea agreement.The transaction was part of a broader scheme in which Chavez and Plasencia discussed exploiting Perry's addiction for financial gain by mocking him in their text exchanges.\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia wrote to Chavez. Chavez faced up to 10 years in federal prison. As part of his October 2024 plea deal, he surrendered his medical licence and passport.",

    "body": "9 hours agoTabby WilsonUS Southern CommandThe US military says it has carried out strikes on three boats it has accused of trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean, killing eight people.The US Southern Command posted footage of the strikes on social media and said the vessels were \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes... and were engaged in narco-trafficking\".More than 20 vessels in the Pacific and the Caribbean have been targeted in recent months, killing at least 90 people, as part of President Donald Trump's escalating campaign against gangs he accuses of transporting drugs in the region.Some experts say the strikes could violate laws governing armed conflict.The first attack by the US - on 2 September - has drawn particular scrutiny as there was not one but two strikes, with survivors of the first killed in the second.Several legal experts have told BBC Verify that the second strike on the alleged Venezuelan drug boat by the US military was probably illegal, and would likely be considered an extrajudicial killing under international law.Previously, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court told the BBC that the US military campaign more broadly had fallen into the category of a planned, systematic attack against civilians during peacetime.In response, the White House said it had acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect the US from cartels \"trying to bring poison to our shores... destroying American lives\". US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected on Tuesday to brief members of both chambers of Congress alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Politico reported that the officials were set to show video of the controversial \"double-tap\" incident to all members of the armed services committees of both the House and Senate later this week. Hegseth has faced pressure to make the footage public.In recent months, the Trump administration has accused Venezuela of funnelling narcotics into the US and has intensified its efforts to isolate President Nicolás Maduro. He has designated two Venezuelan criminal groups - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as foreign terrorist organisations.Thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, have been positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.On 10 December, US forces seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast, which the US claimed was being used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil called the seizure \"international piracy\" and has claimed Trump wants to gain control over Venezuela's vast oil reserves.As part of Trump's wider crackdown on the flow of drugs into America, he has now officially designated fentanyl - the drug most responsible for deadly overdoses in the US - as a weapon of mass destruction.",

The couple were found dead in their home with multiple stab wounds, according to the BBC's US partner CBS NewsA son of film director Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner has been arrested and is being held on suspicion of murder after the couple were found dead in their Los Angeles home. The Los Angeles Police Department said on Monday that Nick Reiner, 32, had been arrested and that he was in custody with no bail. The deceased couple's 28-year-old daughter, Romy, found her parents in their home with multiple stab wounds on Sunday, sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News.Rob Reiner was known for directing several iconic films in a variety of genres, including When Harry Met Sally, This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, Misery and A Few Good Men.The case is expected to be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office on Tuesday, when prosecutors will decide about filing charges.Emergency services were called to provide medical aid at the Reiners' home in Brentwood, California, at about 15:38 local time (23:38 GMT) on Sunday. The Los Angeles Fire Department said two people - later identified as Rob Reiner, 78, and his wife Michele, 68 - were pronounced dead at the scene.Police said Nick Reiner was arrested several hours later, at about 21:15 local time. Investigators have not publicly outlined a motive, and say the investigation is ongoing.Two sources also told CBS News that Rob and Nick Reiner had engaged in a brief but loud argument during a party the previous evening.Nick Reiner has spoken publicly about his struggles with addiction and homelessness. His experiences formed the basis of the semi-autobiographical film Being Charlie, which he made with his father in 2015.The family's home is in Brentwood, a wealthy celebrity enclave full of large mansions, boutique shops and restaurants. On Monday morning, a security guard stood outside the home as media gathered outside the front gate.Watch: \"Lucky\" to have parents that \"care about me\", says Nick Reiner in 2015 interviewRob Reiner, the son of comedy great Carl Reiner, began his career in the 1960s and rose to fame playing Meathead in the TV sitcom All in The Family.He cemented his success with the cult mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap in 1984, which he directed and starred in. Reiner was married to Laverne & Shirley actress Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981 and is the adoptive father to Marshall's daughter, actress Tracy Reiner.He married Michele Reiner in 1989, who he said he met during the making of the romantic comedy-drama film When Harry Met Sally. The couple have three children together.Getty ImagesRob Reiner and his family, including son Nick attend a movie premiere Michele Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.Rob Reiner was also known for his outspoken political activism and support for Democratic candidates. In a post calling their deaths \"very sad\", President Donald Trump criticised Reiner, saying that they \"reportedly\" died \"due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction\" with \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\".\"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump,\" the president wrote.It is not clear what reports the president was referring to, and while the investigation is being treated as a homicide, police have yet to comment on any possible motive. The president and his allies often used the term \"Trump derangement syndrome\" in reference to those who are critical of him. Reiner was a vocal critic of Trump's. Several Republicans criticised Trump over the post, including former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said the deaths were a \"family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies\". \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder,\" she said. \"These go to 11\" - watch Rob Reiner in the amplifier scene from This is Spinal Tap, one of the films he directedTrump's post was also met with anger by some of the Reiners' friends.In a post on X, Maria Shriver, the former first lady of California and longtime friend of the Reiners, said the couple were \"devoted parents\". \"They deeply loved all their children and they never gave up trying to care for them,\" she said. Sir Elton John, who made an appearance in this year's Spinal Tap sequel, said: \"I am in disbelief at today's news of Rob and Michele.\"They were two of the most beautiful people I'd ever met and they deserved better.\"Fellow actor John Cusack, who appeared in Reiner's 1985 film The Sure Thing, called him \"a great man\", while Elijah Wood, who starred in 1994's North, said he was \"horrified\" by the couple's deaths.",

    "body": "2 days agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, SantiagoReutersJosé Antonio Kast will be inaugurated as Chile's president in March next yearChile has elected the far-right wing José Antonio Kast to be its next president, after an election campaign that was dominated by themes of security, immigration and crime.Kast beat the governing left-wing coalition candidate Jeanette Jara decisively with more than 58% of the vote in his third attempt at running for president.It marks the biggest shift to the right since the end of Chile's military dictatorship in 1990. Kast has openly praised Chile's former right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet.In his first speech to supporters as president-elect, Kast said: \"Chile will once again be free from crime, free from anguish, free from fear.\"\"Criminals, delinquents - their lives are going to change. We're going to look for them, find them, judge them and then we're going to lock them up,\" he added.At a gathering of his backers in the capital Santiago, many draped in Chilean flags, chanting and taking selfies, there was jubilation as the results came through.\"I'm happy we can recover the country's security and patriotism,\" said Augustina Trancoso, donning a red \"Make Chile Great Again\" cap.\"We've been trying to win an election for years,\" said Belem Valdivieso. \"In Chile, you used to be able to walk the streets peacefully, lately we've experienced problems with insecurity. I'm hoping his promises will be kept and he'll focus on security.\"Throughout the campaign, Kast portrayed Chile as a country that was descending into chaos and insecurity. He pledged to restore order and crack down on irregular immigration, as well as implementing sharp spending cuts.Kast is an admirer of Donald Trump, who is likely to become a close ally, and his policies echo those of the US president. He has pledged a border wall on Chile's porous frontier with Peru and Bolivia, maximum-security prisons, and mass deportations of irregular migrants, many of whom are from Venezuela.Augustina Trancoso voted for Kast in Sunday's presidential electionChile is one of the safest and more stable countries in South America, but a rise in immigration and organised crime in recent years has concerned many voters. Kast regularly drew links between the two.His critics, though, say the problem is being exaggerated.One voter in Santiago, Javiera Carrasco, liked some of Kast's policies but ended up voting for Communist Party member Jara. She said she felt \"like a false sense of insecurity is becoming widespread.\"\"In other countries, there are much worse things happening than here. It just doesn't add up for me.\"Chile's murder rate is now falling, and some studies suggest those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average. But the perception of growing insecurity was the motivation for many of Kast's voters.\"We are transforming into Colombia, a lot of terrorism, thieves, robbery, society is very unsafe,\" one voter Max Struber said.\"It may sound harsh to say it, but we need the government to continue Pinochet's work. Human rights abuses existed, that's true. But as a government it was good, we used to have peace and tranquility.\"Kast's brother was a minister during Pinochet's dictatorship, and his father was a member of the Nazi party. Pinochet was an army general who led a US-backed military coup in 1973 and established a 17-year-long military dictatorship that was marked by brutal human rights abuses, forced disappearances and free-market economic policies.ReutersCommunist Party member Jeannette Jara was the left-wing coalition candidateChile's current left-wing President Gabriel Boric, who could not run again, had suffered from low approval ratings. Kast's rival Jeannette Jara may have suffered by being seen as a \"continuity vote\".A supporter at his victory party, Francisco Otero, said neither candidate represented everybody perfectly, but that a continuation of the government was seen as \"much worse\".After the result Jara posted that \"democracy has spoken loud and clear\" and wished Kast \"success for the good of Chile.\"\"We will continue working to advance a better life in our country,\" she added.Her supporters fear Kast's election marks a return to Chile's far-right past.\"Kast's family helped the dictator Augusto Pinochet,\" Ricardo Herrera said, adding that he lived through Pinochet's dictatorship and it was \"brutal\".Some are sceptical, though, that Kast will actually do what he's pledged.\"Kast says he wants to expel 360,000 undocumented migrants. He won't be able to do that. It's physically impossible,\" one voter Hector Lunes said.Ricardo Herrera, who lived through Pinochet's rule, voted for Jeannette JaraKast has also been firmly against abortion, even in cases of rape, and environmental protection policies.His victory will likely be welcomed by investors as he has pledged a free-market approach to economics to shrink the state and deregulate certain industries.This was the first presidential election in Chile where voting was mandatory and registration was automatic for those eligible.This left some voters feeling like they had to pick whichever they say was the \"least-worst\" option.\"I don't know if I'd say the lesser of two evils, but I think Chile needs a change,\" Claudio Sanjuez said, \"and I clearly think Kast could be that alternative\".\"Both candidates were like opposite extremes,\" Cintia Urrutia said, but added she'd hoped for Jeannette Jara who she perceived as more \"centrist\".Kast's victory in Chile follows a string of elections in Latin America that have shifted the region to the Right in recent years – including in Argentina, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.He will be inaugurated on 11 March 2026. At rallies, he regularly counted down the days until this date warning undocumented immigrants that they should leave before then if they ever want the chance to return.",

Only my neighbour gave me some to cover myself. I have nothing left. I've lost everything.\"Another survivor said he wanted to see government trucks at the scene to pump out the water.Moroccan authorities say search and rescue missions are still under way.Experts say the climate crisis is in part responsible for the extreme weather fluctuations seen in the North African state.It has suffered seven years of drought in a row, depleting its reservoirs. Last year was officially the hottest ever on record.This latest, sudden downpour is expected to continue on Tuesday together with snowfall across the Atlas mountains, Morocco's weather service warns.",

    "body": "15 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS President Donald Trump has repeated his criticism of Rob Reiner - after his earlier remarks about the killed Hollywood director, a longtime Trump critic, sparked widespread condemnation.The US president told reporters the director was \"very bad for our country\", having earlier written on Truth Social that Reiner's death was linked to \"Trump derangement syndrome\" - a term he often uses to describe his critics.Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner were found dead at their Los Angeles home on Sunday, and police have arrested their son Nick on suspicion of murder.They have not suggested any motive in the case, or any evidence that Reiner's politics and criticism of Trump played any role.In his social media post, which called the couple's deaths \"very sad\", Trump criticised Reiner, saying: \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump.\"Those comments were widely criticised, including by prominent Republicans.Kentucky representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who has clashed with Trump since the president returned to the White House in January, wrote on X: \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.\"He added: \"I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once a staunch supporter of Trump before recently becoming a frequent critic, said that \"this is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies\" and that the murders should be \"met with empathy\".Multiple other senior members of Trump's party appeared to distance themselves from the remarks. Senator John Kennedy, a Republican representing Louisiana, said he thought Trump should not have made the comments.\"I think a wise man once said nothing. Why? Because he was a wise man,\" Kennedy said. \"I think President Trump should have said nothing. I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements.\"Reiner was a lifelong Democrat and prominent liberal activist, and frequently spoke out against Trump.In 2017, for example, he called Trump \"mentally unfit\" for office. And as recently as October, Reiner said he believed Trump was ushering in an age of \"full-on autocracy\" in the US.Hours after his social media post, Trump repeated his thoughts on Reiner in comments given in the Oval Office to reporters, describing the director as a \"deranged person\" who was partly \"behind\" previous claims of collusion between Russia and Trump's team.\"I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form,\" he said.Trump has in the past criticised political foes after their death.Following the death of Arizona Senator John McCain - with whom he clashed regularly - in 2019, for example, Trump said he \"was never a fan\" and \"never will be\".In another incident the same year, Trump quipped that the late Democratic lawmaker John Dingell could be \"looking up\" at him from the grave, a comment which was widely interpreted as a suggestion that Dingell was in hell.In a statement following the remarks about Dingell, the White House said that the president was \"just riffing\".Reiner, who was 78, was known for directing several iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, Misery and A Few Good Men.He married Michele, an actress, photographer and producer, in 1989, later recalling that they met during the making of one of his best-known films, When Harry Met Sally. The couple had three children together - including Nick, 32.Michele, 68, owned the Reiner Light photography agency and production house.",

Albanese said Mr Ahmed would \"undergo further surgery\" on Wednesday.At least 15 people have been confirmed dead after Sunday's attack in Sydney during an event to mark the first night of Hanukkah.Police have declared the attack as a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.\"He was trying to get a cup of coffee and found himself at a moment where people were being shot in front of him,\" Albanese said after the bedside visit. \"He decided to take action, and his bravery is an inspiration for all Australians. He is a very humble man.\"\"At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,\" the prime minister added. \"We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"He later added: \"Ahmed, you are an Australian hero.\"There has been nationwide support for the 43-year-old including from US President Donald Trump who commended his courage, and a US billionaire who donated $99,999 (US$ 65,000; £49,000) to Mr Ahmed, calling him a \"brave hero\".In the footage, Mr Ahmed is seen hiding behind a parked car before he leaps out.He runs at the alleged gunman and seizes his weapon, before turning the gun round on him. The suspected attacker then begins to retreat.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the  attackers.Mr Ahmed's father previously told the BBC that his son was driven to act by his \"sentiment, conscience and humanity\".He \"saw the victims, the blood, women and children lying on the street, and then acted\".",

    "body": "15 hours agoMark SavageMusic CorrespondentReutersLizzo said the fat-shaming claims had \"haunted\" her for the last two yearsPop star Lizzo is celebrating a legal victory after a judge dismissed allegations of fat-shaming from a 2023 lawsuit filed by three of her former dancers.The singer, whose hits include body positive anthems such as Good As Hell and Juice, marked the development with a video statement posted to her Instagram and TikTok feeds.\"There was no evidence that I fired them because they gained weight,\" Lizzo said. \"They were fired for taking a private recording of me without my consent and sending it off to ex-employees.\"While those specific allegations have been dropped, the case against Lizzo and her production company will continue, over claims that three dancers were subject to sexual harassment.Lizzo's team has called the lawsuit a \"fabricated sob story,\" but a Los Angeles judge ruled that the case could move forward last year.Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams and Noelle Rodriguez say they were pressured into attending sex shows and interacting with nude performers between 2021 and 2023.The claims against Lizzo - whose real name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson - include that she \"pressured Ms Davis to touch the breasts\" of a dancer in a nightclub in Amsterdam.Although she initially resisted, Ms Davis eventually acquiesced, \"fearing it may harm her future on the team\" if she didn't do so, according to court documents.Other incidents cited in the case include the claim that dancers were asked to eat fruit from the naked bodies of sex club workers.Over the summer, Lizzo's lawyers appealed the decision to let those claims got to trial, arguing that group outings were part of the singer's creative process and thus should be shielded by First Amendment free speech protections. In response, a lawyer for the dancers rejected that claim, saying it was not enough to say the sex shows had inspired Lizzo's own performances.\"Under that standard,\" wrote Ari Stiller, \"Johnny Cash could shoot 'a man in Reno just to watch him die' and claim protection if he hoped it would inspire his performance\".Stiller urged the court to allow the claims to proceed to trial.Getty ImagesLizzo said she had worked to celebrate people with larger bodies throughout her career (none of the dancers pictured are thought to be part of the current lawsuit)Lizzo's attorney, Melissa Glass, claimed that Stiller's brief \"regurgitates the false accusations from their [original] complaint\".\"As was true two years ago, the dancers cannot find a single person to corroborate their meritless claims,\" Glass said in a statement to Billboard magazine. \"In contrast, 18 witnesses who worked with Lizzo on the Special tour submitted sworn statements refuting the claims made by Davis, Williams and Rodriguez. We look forward to the Court of Appeals ruling on this matter.\"Lizzo has adamantly denied the allegations against her.\"I am very open with my sexuality and expressing myself but I cannot accept or allow people to use that openness to make me out to be something I am not,\" she said when the claims first emerged in 2023.In her latest statement, the singer added that the fat-shaming allegations had \"haunted\" her for the last two years, adding that it had been \"devastating to suffer through this in silence\". She also stressed that she has \"only encouraged and supported people with bigger bodies and shared my platform with them.\"Thanking her lawyers, Lizzo said she intended to keep fighting the lawsuit. \"I am not settling,\" she said. \"I will be fighting every single claim until the truth is out.",

    "body": "5 minutes agoMax MatzaandNardine Saad,in Los AngelesProsecutors in Los Angeles have filed murder charges against Nick Reiner over the deaths of his parents, Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.Nick Reiner is facing two counts of first-degree murder with a special circumstance alleging multiple murders, District Attorney Nathan Hochman said.He could be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty if found guilty. He will be brought to court to formally face charges and enter a plea after he is medically cleared by prison officials, Mr Hochman said.The charges came two days after the couple were found dead in their home in Brentwood, California, with multiple stab wounds.The charges also include a \"special allegation\" that Reiner used a knife.During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Hochman said no decision had been made about whether prosecutors would seek the death penalty.The suspect, 32, was also accused of using a \"dangerous and deadly weapon, that being a knife\".He was expected to appear before a judge later on Tuesday for an arraignment hearing, where he would have been formally charged. The district attorney later said it would be scheduled for a later date.Rob Reiner directed several iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.Michele Singer Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.LA Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell told the news conference: \"This case is heartbreaking and deeply personal, not only for the Reiner family and their loved ones, but for the entire city.\"\"We extend our deepest condolences to everyone affected by this tragedy.\"During the news conference, officials declined to say how the suspect was located, attributing his arrest to \"good, solid police work\".District Attorney Hochman added that it is too early to say whether any \"mental illness\" played a role in the crime, adding: \"If there is evidence of mental illness, it will appear in court, in whatever details the defence seeks to present.\"",

    "body": "Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi was taken to hospital after being beaten when she was arrested last week, her family says.The 53-year-old human rights activist told them in a phone call on Sunday that she was brought to an emergency department twice after being \"attacked by plain clothed agents with severe and repeated baton blows to the head and neck\", according to the Narges Foundation.There was no comment from Iranian authorities, but they have said she was detained for making \"provocative remarks\" at a memorial ceremony in the city of Mashhad on Friday.The Nobel Committee and award-winning film-maker Jafar Panahi are among those calling for her release.Ms Mohammadi, the vice-president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran, was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights.She has spent more than 10 years of her life in prison. Since 2021, she has been serving a 13-year sentence on charges of committing \"propaganda activity against the state\" and \"collusion against state security\", which she denied.In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison on medical grounds.She has continued campaigning while undergoing treatment.On Friday, she gave a speech at a memorial ceremony in Mashhad for Khosrow Alikordi, a human rights activist and lawyer who was found dead earlier this month in what human rights groups described as \"suspicious\" circumstances.According to the Narges Foundation, eyewitnesses cited by Ms Mohammadi's family said that she was attacked by around 15 plainclothes agents at the memorial, and that some were seen pulling her hair and beating her with clubs and batons.On Sunday evening, Ms Mohammadi made a brief phone call to her family and told them that \"the intensity of the blows was so heavy, forceful, and repeated that she was taken to the hospital emergency room twice\", a statement said.\"She emphasised that she does not even know which security authority is currently detaining her, and that no explanation has been given in this regard. Her physical condition at the time of the call was not good, and she appeared unwell,\" it added.The Narges Foundation cited Ms Mohammadi as saying that she was accused of \"co-operating with the Israeli government\" and that they had made a death threat, telling her: \"We will put your mother into mourning.\"The statement said that two other activists detained at the memorial ceremony, Sepideh Gholian and Pouran Nazemi, were also beaten by the plainclothes agents.Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar told reporters on Saturday that Ms Mohammadi was among 39 people arrested.He said that she and Khosrow Alikordi's brother, Javad, had encouraged those present \"to chant norm-breaking slogans\" and \"disturb the peace\".The Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday that it was deeply concerned by what it called the \"brutal arrest\" of Ms Mohammadi and called on Iranian authorities to \"ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\".Jafar Panahi, fellow film-maker Mohammad Rasoulof and more than a dozen other activists said in a joint statement that what happened at Alikordi's memorial ceremony \"was a stark reflection of the worrying state of freedom and security, and, consequently, the inefficiency and lack of accountability of the authorities in today's Iran\".",

    "body": "The US has said it is ready to offer Ukraine Nato-like security guarantees to safeguard an eventual ceasefire, following talks in Berlin with European officials and a delegation from Kyiv.The \"very strong\" guarantees would be modelled on Nato's Article 5 clause of mutual protection, US officials said, adding that the Russians would hopefully agree to them.While US officials talked up progress towards ending the war, there was little detail on how the thorny issue of Ukraine's sovereignty would be resolved in any peace deal.  Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky described the meeting as \"productive\" but not easy. He added that Kyiv needed a \"clear understanding of security guarantees\" before it could make any decisions about other contentious issues.Ukraine has long argued it needs watertight guarantees to ensure that Russia respects any ceasefire and does not attack the country again. US officials described the security guarantees on offer as the \"platinum standard\", but cautioned the deal \"would not be on the table forever\". On Sunday, Zelensky signalled for the first time that as a \"compromise\" he would give up ambitions to join Nato in exchange for strong guarantees.While there appears to be significant movement on the issue of security, the eastern region of the Donbas remains a major sticking point. The US is now suggesting an \"economic-free zone\" could be established in the contested part of the Donbas, but that would require Ukraine accepting to withdraw from the areas it still holds, while Russia would not be expected to do the same.\"It seems to me that [the US and Ukraine] so far have different positions, to be honest,\" Zelensky said.US officials said that if the economic free zone could be defined, \"then it will really be up to the parties to work out the final issues of sovereignty.\"But Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on the issue of the Donbas. Russia mostly occupies the region and it wants Kyiv to hand it over in its entirety, which Ukraine is staunchly refusing to do.The US officials said Washington was now willing to submit a security package for Senate ratification.Speaking from the White House, US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Zelensky and European leaders, describing it as a \"very good talk\". \"I think we're closer now than we have been, ever,\" he said, referring to reaching a peace deal.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who hosted the discussions, struck a similar tone earlier on Monday, saying \"this is the first time a ceasefire is conceivable.\"\"It's a huge progress which I welcome very much,\" he said, describing Washington's security guarantees as \"remarkable\". Several European leaders, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, will join further talks with the Ukrainian and US delegations on Monday evening. At the core of the discussions in Berlin is the 20-point peace plan proposal which Ukraine presented to the US last week, to counter an initial American plan which was seen as heavily favouring Russia.Details haven't been shared, but last week Zelensky said the points should be seen as a \"foundation\" on which to build provisions for the reconstruction of Ukraine and security guarantees.Any proposal hashed out by the Ukrainian, American and European side will still have to be presented to Moscow – although Zelensky said that the US delegation \"so to speak present the Russian side's perspective, because they relay Russia's signals, demands, steps, and indications of readiness or lack thereof.\"The Kremlin said it expected the US to provide it with the \"concept\" discussed on Monday.The talks in Berlin come at a crucial time for Ukraine, which is enduring its fourth winter of war amid sustained power cuts caused by Russia's attacks on its energy facilities. Over the weekend more than a million Ukrainian households were left without electricity following a barrage of strikes. Zelensky said on Monday that there was not a \"single functioning power station\" that had not been attacked by the Russians. Later this week, EU countries will be voting on a plan to send €90bn (£78.6bn) worth of frozen Russian assets held in a Belgium-based financial institution to prop up Ukraine's economy.On Friday, EU governments agreed to immobilise the Russian assets indefinitely - but there is no consensus yet on whether they can be sent to Ukraine. Belgium has been resisting the legally contentious proposal, and in recent days other countries, including Italy, have said \"alternative options\" should be put forward.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas acknowledged the discussions were \"increasingly difficult\". \"But we're doing the work, and we still have some days,\" she added.",

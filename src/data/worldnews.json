    "body": "A bulky bluefin tuna made a splash at Tokyo's Toyosu fish market on Monday morning, fetching a record 510.3 million yen ($3.2m; £2.4m) at the market's first auction of the year.The winning bid for the 243kg fish came from Kiyomura Corp, the operator of popular sushi chain Sushi Zanmai, which has outlets across the country and abroad.\"The year's first tuna brings good luck,\" said Kiyoshi Kimura, the company's president and a familiar figure at the annual new year's auction, Kyodo reported.Mr Kimura, who has been dubbed the Tuna King, is known to bid high for bluefin tuna at new year's auctions. The entrepreneur told reporters after the auction that he was \"surprised at the price\", AFP reported.\"I'd thought we would be able to buy a little cheaper, but the price soared before you knew it,\" he said.Mr Kimura paid 56.5 million yen for a bluefin tuna in 2012 and 155 million yen in 2013 - setting record prices both times.In 2019 he bought a bluefin tuna with 333.6 million yen ($2.1m; £1.6m) - another historic price.Despite telling reporters at the time that he thought he \"did too much\", however, Mr Kimura has now gone on to break his own record again.The first auction at Tokyo's Toyosu fish market typically sees fish selling for exorbitant prices.Last year, the first tuna at the auction was bought for 207 million yen by Onodera Group, another food company that owns a sushi chain. It said that the fish would be served at its restaurants across the country.The frenetic energy at fish markets during such pre-dawn auctions has become a popular tourist attraction in Tokyo. Monday's auction, which started at around 05:00 local time (20:00 GMT), was no exception.The million-dollar tuna was sliced up for customers at Kimura's sushi restaurants shortly after it was auctioned off.\"I feel like I've begun the year in a good way after eating something so auspicious as the year starts,\" one of the customers at Mr Kimura's restaurant told AFP.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris correspondentandKathryn ArmstrongTen people have been found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, by a Paris court. The defendants were accused of spreading false claims about her gender and sexuality, as well as making \"malicious remarks\" about the 24-year age gap between the couple. Most of the defendants were handed suspended prison sentences of up to eight months, but one was jailed immediately for failing to attend court. Some had their social media accounts suspended.The judge said the eight men and two women had acted with a clear desire to do harm to Brigitte Macron, making remarks online that were degrading and insulting.Two of the defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander in 2024 for claiming that France's first lady had never existed.They said her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name. They were later cleared on appeal. The argument used by the appeals court in clearing them was that saying someone had changed gender was not necessarily an \"attack on their honour\".  The Macrons are now taking that case to the high court of appeal.\"The most important things are the prevention courses and the suspension of some of the accounts\" of the perpetrators, Jean Ennochi, Brigitte Macron's lawyer, said after the verdict was handed down, the AFP news agency reported.Tiphaine Auzière, Brigitte Macron's daughter from a previous marriage, previously told the trial that the cyber-bullying had negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.She said her mother \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... she knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories\".While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.Monday's ruling in France is a forerunner of a much bigger trial due in the US, where the Macrons have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has also voiced conspiracy theories about the first lady's gender. They alleged that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on her belief that the first lady \"is in fact a man\".The presidential couple were initially advised that the best course was to ignore the online gossip, because to go to law would simply amplify it.But last year there was a radical change of course. The Macrons decided that the scale of the online attacks was now too large to ignore. So, at risk of exposing their private selves in a US court, they determined to push back against the conspiracy theorists.A conspiracy theory claiming that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has circulated since her husband was first elected in 2017.Brigitte Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.The couple married in 2007, when the future French president was 29 and she was in her mid-50s.",

    "body": "A far-left activist group in Germany has claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that left tens of thousands of homes, as well as hospitals and businesses, without power in around-freezing temperatures.The Vulkangruppe (Volcano Group) said in a statement that the fossil fuel economy, not cutting power, was the target of the action.It will take until Thursday to reconnect power for all customers, with some schools due to be closed at the start of this week.Early on Saturday, several cables on a bridge were spotted burning near a power plant in south-west Berlin. The fire was quickly put out, but around 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses were left without electricity.The state economy minister told German media that incendiary devices had caused the damage.Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, accusing \"suspected left-wing extremists\" of knowingly endangering lives, especially those of patients in hospitals.Hospitals and care facilities had received emergency power generators, officials said. The response had included transferring individuals from care sites and people requiring care in their own homes from the affected area to care facilities with reported available capacity.Some hospitals had their electricity restored by Sunday.As of Sunday afternoon, around 10,000 households and 300 businesses had been reconnected, with most still waiting to receive power back.Some schools, which were due to reopen on Monday after the Christmas holidays, will remain closed.The capital's electricity operator said it would take until Thursday to reconnect all customers.The Vulkangruppe in its statement apologised to less affluent residents impacted by the power cuts, but said it had less sympathy for \"the many owners of villas\".The statement said the attack on the gas-fired power plant was an \"act of self-defence\" and solidarity with those who protect the earth.Police told AFP news agency they believed the statement was \"plausible\" while they continued to investigate, with other media reporting police thought it was credible.The Vulkangruppe previously claimed responsibility for a suspected arson attack that halted production at Tesla's Berlin car factory in 2024.",

    "body": "The Cuban government says 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.It described the dead as members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies were killed \"in combat actions\", declaring two days of national mourning. The armed forces added the Cubans \"fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombardments of installations\"Cuba, a long-standing ally of Venezuela, has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail and has personnel throughout the Venezuelan military.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the country had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife \"at the request\" of Venezuela. US spies had been monitoring Maduro's movements for months before US forces struck, according to US General Dan Caine.Gen Caine said that they had learned where the former leader moved, lived, travelled, ate, and worked.The New York Times reported that the CIA had also recruited a \"Venezuelan source\"  who it says informed the Americans of Maduro's exact location.Many of those killed are believed to have been part of Maduro's close security detail, who were with him at the time. Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed, but its armed forces  have said that a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team were among the casualties.An official statement from the Cuban government read: \"Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism\".The total death toll - according to an unnamed Venezuelan official cited by the New York Times - stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the seizure of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because \"Cuba is ready to fall\". He continued: \"I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count.\"On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a \"disaster\" run by \"incompetent, senile men\". \"If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit,\" Rubio said.In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor, Joe Biden, easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end \"economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people\".It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions.His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since. ",

    "body": "15 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesA national day of mourning has been announced in Switzerland for 9 JanuaryThe bodies of the 40 victims of a bar fire in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve have been identified by police.The victims range in age from 14 to 39 years old, with 15 aged under 18. The youngest were a Swiss girl and a French boy, both 14. The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish, Portuguese, French, and Belgian nationalities, as well as a citizen of the UK, France and Israel.In addition to the 40 killed, 119 others were injured. Most have severe burns - six of them so severe that they have yet to be identified. A criminal investigation into the French couple who managed Le Constellation bar is under way. Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.Police said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.However, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce her 16-year-old son, Arthur, was one of the dead. \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light,\" she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message. He \"has left to party in paradise\", she said.While Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been \"living a nightmare\".Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookArthur Brodard's mother posted a moving tribute to her sonLe Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.SUPPLIEDVideo from inside the bar appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fireThe French couple who own the bar - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office for the Valais region said.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".A teenager who went to two schools in the UK has been confirmed as one of the victims killed in the fire. Charlotte Niddam, who was believed to be 15, previously attended Immanuel College in Hertfordshire and the Jewish Free School in north-west London, according to reports.In a post on social media, the teenager's family announced her death \"with great sadness\" and said details of her funeral arrangements would be made in due course. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also confirmed the news in a post on X.Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as the first identified victim of the fire following a statement from the Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father is quoted as saying his son was at Le Constellation. A spokesperson for the Italian foreign ministry previously told the BBC it would not confirm the death.",

    "body": "1 day agoAleks PhillipsandNikos PapanikolaouGetty ImagesThessaloniki Airport closed entirely after air traffic communication was knock outThousands of passengers are stranded across Europe after a communications failure forced Greece to close its airspace, causing widespread cancellations and delays.Officials are working to understand why radio communications were disrupted on Sunday morning, prompting the temporary suspension of arrivals and departures.Some departures have since been allowed to resume - though inbound flights are still being told to divert or return to their point of origin. Athens' main airport is among the worst affected, while Thessaloniki airport has closed entirely.The timing of the disruption has raised fears that travellers will not be able to get home before the start of the working week.\"I was supposed to fly to London, via Stockholm, with SAS,\" one passenger at Athens International Airport told Greek broadcaster Mega TV. \"I'm working on Newport Hospital tomorrow morning. I'm not going to be there on time, I don't know what else to say. \"Who is going to pay for the additional cost this travel will cost me? We still don't know if and when we're going to leave, no one is telling us anything.\"More than 90 flights have been affected in and out of Athens airport alone - though some flights have since been able to resume.A member of staff in the airport told the BBC that 35 aircraft an hour were now being allowed to take off, but it was still unable to take inbound flights.Flights departing from Dublin, Barcelona and Paris were earlier ordered to return to their airports of origin, while services from Copenhagen and Malta were cancelled altogether. Other arrivals into Athens were placed on standby, while flights in and out of other Greek airports have also been affected. Three flights out of Heraklion airport on the island of Crete, including one to Munich, have been delayed, according to public broadcaster ERT.Most inbound flights are being diverted to Turkey if not cancelled outright, it reports.Reuters / Flightradar24Greek airspace was nearly empty earlier on Sunday due to the technical faultThe disruption comes at a busy time for air travel in and out of Athens, which typically sees more than 600 scheduled flights per day, as people return from winter holidays.In the chaos, some passengers have complained of a lack of information. One told news site Flash: \"We have no updates. They told us that we will be able to leave but I don't think this is true. On the departures board I can't see my flight, and I'm supposed to leave shortly.\"Another, who had been on a flight to Rhodes when it turned around and headed back to Athens, told news agency Reuters: \"From that moment until now we have no information whatsoever.\"Domestic travellers may have the option of getting home on Greece's rail network, but this would take significantly longer.The issue that caused the disruption is thought to concern the radio system used by air traffic controllers to communicate with planes in their airspace.Panagiotis Psarros, chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers, told ERT that all frequencies were \"suddenly lost\", adding: \"We could not communicate with aircraft in the sky.\"The broadcaster later reported than an initial investigation by the Greek security services suggested the problem may be due to the failure of an antenna in the Gerania Mountains near Athens. Italy, Turkey and Cyprus are assisting Greece in managing the situation.",

    "body": "20 hours agoTiffany Wertheimer,Makuochi OkaforandBBC HausaZakari KontagoraBandits set fire to the village market and looted goodsArmed men have violently stormed a village in Nigeria's Niger state, killing at least 30 people and looting shops, state authorities have said.The attackers emerged from a forest near the village of Kasuwan-Daji on Saturday and set fire to the local market, looted shops and kidnapped an unspecified number of people, police said.\"The gunmen entered the town on motorcycles carrying weapons, rounded up people and then proceeded to slaughter them, while others were shot dead,\" a local journalist told the BBC's Hausa service.Attacks and kidnappings by armed criminal gangs, known as bandits, have been a problem in Nigeria for years, but reports in western and central regions have spiked recently.Abdullahi Rofia, an official with the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, confirmed the journalist's report that villagers were rounded up and killed.He told the BBC that people in the community were terrified: \"They are hiding, they are too afraid to talk to anybody.\"They are scared that if you talk, they will turn and do the same to you.\"Niger state police spokesperson, Wasiu Abiodun, said an emergency team has been deployed to help the injured and security forces are working to rescue those kidnapped. It is illegal to pay ransom money to the criminal groups, which the government has classified as terrorists, but there are claims this is often ignored.Zakari KontagoraThe attack on Kasuwan-Daji is the latest is a spike of violent attacks against villages in Niger stateA witness to the attack told BBC Hausa that there were no security forces in the village. \"We want the government to help us. In the past, we used to hear about this problem in other places, but now it is happening in our villages,\" he said.The fear is driving people from their homes where they were born and raised.\"We are dying like chickens, and does the government care about us? \"The government hears and sees what is happening, but it is not doing anything about it. What can we do as ordinary people?\"Zakari KontagoraVillagers say the attacks are driving people away from the villages they grew up in",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" in reference to demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

    "body": "2 hours agoThomas Mackintosh'We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,' Trump saysNick BeakeEurope correspondentDonald Trump has again proposed annexing Greenland, after Denmark's leader urged him to \"stop the threats\" over the island. Speaking to reporters, the US president said \"we need Greenland from the standpoint of national security\".Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect of the semi-autonomous Danish territory becoming an annexed part of the US, citing its strategic location for defence purposes and mineral wealth. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded by saying \"that's enough now\" and described the notion of US control over the island as a \"fantasy\". He said: \"No more pressure. No more insinuations. No more fantasies of annexation. We are open to dialogue. We are open to discussions. But this must happen through the proper channels and with respect for international law.\"Earlier, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had said \"the US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom\".Frederiksen added that Denmark \"and thus Greenland\" was a Nato member and covered by the alliance's security guarantee, and said a defence agreement granting the US access to the island was already in place. The Danish prime minister released her statement after Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's senior aides, Stephen Miller - posted on social media a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag alongside the word \"SOON\".The Danish ambassador to the US responded to the post by Miller - a right-wing podcaster and former aide to Trump during his first term - with a \"friendly reminder\" that the two countries were allies and saying Denmark expected respect for its territorial integrity.The back and forth over the future Greenland comes in the wake of a major military operation against Venezuela on Saturday, seizing its president Nicolás Maduro and his wife and removing them to New York.Trump later said the US would \"run\" Venezuela and US oil companies would \"start making money for the country\".The situation has reignited fears that the US may consider using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic - something the US president has previously refused to rule out. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve American security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark.Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.In comments to the BBC, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said that only Denmark and Greenland could decide the territory's fate. \"Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark must decide the future of Greenland, and only Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark,\" he said.Separately, a representative for the European Union has rejected a claim by Trump that the EU \"needs\" the US to control the territory. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One at the weekend that \"the EU needs us to have [Greenland] and they know that.\"European Commission chief spokesperson Paula Pinho told the BBC that it was \"certainly not\" the EU's position, adding that she was unaware of any discussions with the US about the issue.More on this storyFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "7 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandKoh EweReutersVisiting Beijing at this time is a significant move for Lee Jae MyungSouth Korea's President Lee Jae Myung is meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping as he seeks to reset frayed ties with his country's biggest trading partner.Regional security and Beijing's unofficial ban on Korean pop culture are also on the agenda for Monday's meeting, which is their second summit since November, when  Xi visited South Korea. Given what a vital economic partner China is, experts say Lee is looking for assurances that it would not weaponise that relationship in the face of political tensions in the region.For weeks, China and Japan have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the former's claim on self-governed Taiwan, which puts Seoul, a key regional power, in an awkward spot.Getty ImagesBeijing ramped up the rhetoric against Japan after its prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in parliament that Tokyo could respond with its own self defence force in case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. So visiting Beijing at this time is a significant move for Lee. Like Japan, South Korea too is an ally of the US, which supports Taiwan and supplies arms for its defence.  Xi is expected to hold a welcoming ceremony for Lee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, state-run CCTV reports.Lee, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, will then meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji, before flying to Shanghai.Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".This is the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. The relationship soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China.    On the other side, Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC.\"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\"Beijing has been leveraging the two countries' shared history of fighting against Japan during the 20th Century, Mr Park said. Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan.While Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park added.Seoul has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Takaichi. And on Friday, South Korea's national security director Wi Sung-lac told reporters the country \"respects the One China policy\" - the diplomatic acknowledgment that Beijing is the only Chinese government. Security on the Korean Peninsula will also be part of the discussions with China, Wi told reporters.Lee has sought to engage North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far. He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is the dictator's biggest supporter, economically and diplomatically, Russia aside.\"China is a very important cooperative partner in moving toward peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula,\" Lee said on Sunday.Earlier in the day Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, a reference to  the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies. US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.There are other sore spots, such as China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region. Persuading Beijing to lift these restrictions is said to be high on Lee's agenda. China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.                                                        Lee will also be seeking to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.",

    "body": "17 hours agoJugal PurohitBBC HindiLightRocket via Getty ImagesDelhi and Moscow have signed a deal to manufacture the SJ-100 plane in IndiaIndia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets. IndiGo and Air India, which together hold over 90% of the market, have ordered nearly 1,500 planes over the next decade, highlighting soaring passenger demand.This expansion hinges on Boeing and Airbus, which together supply 86% of the world's aircraft and faced \"historically high\" delivery backlogs in 2024 - delays expected to affect Indian orders too.This has revived an old question: should India try to build its own passenger planes?The prospect drew attention in October, when India and Russia signed an initial agreement in Moscow to manufacture the SJ-100 passenger plane in India, raising hopes for domestic aircraft production.But is the Russia deal a solution? Its joint manufacturing plan still faces many hurdles before coming to fruition.Getty ImagesIndia is among the world's fastest growing aviation marketsThe SJ-100 is a twin-engine aircraft that can carry up to 103 passengers and is already in service with several Russian airlines, according to its manufacturer, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC).Delhi has described the aircraft as a \"game changer\" and plans to use it for short-haul routes. But experts have questioned the project's cost and feasibility - much of which is still unclear.One of the biggest concerns is whether the Russian firm would be able to rapidly set up and scale production in India.The aircraft's manufacturer says it delivered around 200 SJ-100 aircraft between 2008 and 2020. But that trajectory shifted in 2022 when Russia launched its war against Ukraine.Western sanctions cut off key spare parts, forcing the company to replace about 40 systems and operate an \"import-substituted\" version in 2023. Europe's aviation safety regulator withdrew the aircraft's certification, effectively banning the SJ-100 and other Russian planes from its airspace.India has long aimed to build passenger aircraft domestically but has achieved only limited success.In 1959, the government set up the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) to develop \"small and medium-sized civil aircraft\".The facility has developed the two-seater Hansa and five-seater trainer planes, but larger passenger aircraft remain out of reach.In the 1960s, India built passenger planes under foreign licenses. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) produced dozens of UK-designed Avro 748 jets, used by both commercial airlines and the military before being phased out.In the 1980s, India partnered with German firm Dornier to produce a 19-seat passenger jet, some of which still serve the military and limited civil routes.With the momentum going, India has also tried to ingeniously design its own small passenger planes.Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesThousands of passengers were stranded across airports after IndiGo cancelled flights last monthIn 2000, India also signed an agreement with Russia for help in manufacturing the NAL's 15-seater Saras aircraft. The plane made its maiden flight in May 2004, but the project was stalled in 2009 after three pilots were killed during an accident involving its second prototype.The project was revived by the Indian government years later with the next prototype Saras MK2, a 19-seater plane, but it is still awaiting certification.Another such project, the Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) has also seen very little progress through the years. Feasibility reports for the 90-seater, comparable to the Russian SJ-100, were submitted in 2011, with little progress since.Aviation experts say aircraft manufacturing in India has faced hurdles for a long time now.Dr Abhay Pashilkar, director of NAL, points that the \"lack of large domestic demand\" until recently, along with a shortage of highly skilled manpower and a small domestic manufacturing ecosystem, has held back growth in the sector.The way out, he adds, is \"to engage with Indian as well as global manufacturers\".So, could the SJ-100 project indeed be a game-changer?For now, it appears so.The plan offers a \"practical approach\" as India's own projects are nowhere near completion, says Gopal Sutar, former spokesperson of the HAL.For Moscow as well, wider acceptance of the SJ-100 would prove that they could make a civil aircraft without western technology.While the deal comes with clear trade-offs and leaves questions about the future of India's aviation manufacturing ambitions, experts like Mr Sutar argue that Russia's role as a \"steadfast supporter\" of India remains key.\"Sanctions could pose challenges, but that would have been factored in by both countries,\" he said.Aircraft availability is only part of India's aviation challenge; rapid expansion also hinges on trained crews. Earlier this month, IndiGo cancelled thousands of flights due to \"poor planning of pilot rosters,\" leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded for hours or even days.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "11 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinReutersDonald Trump has warned Venezuela's new leader Delcy Rodríguez she could \"pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro\" if she \"doesn't do what's right\".His comments to US magazine The Atlantic came as the country's deposed president Nicolás Maduro was set to appear in a New York court on Monday.The US accuses Maduro, who is charged with drug trafficking and weapons offences, of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime, a claim he denies. Rodríguez - who served as Maduro's vice president - adopted a conciliatory tone at her first cabinet meeting on Sunday, offering co-operation with the US. \"We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of co-operation orientated towards shared development within the framework of international law,\" she said.Backed by Venezuela's Supreme Court and the military, she will be sworn in as president on Monday in Caracas, at 08:00 local time (12:00 GMT).US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has insisted the US is not at war with Venezuela, after air strikes in Caracas on Saturday led to Maduro and his wife being taken into custody and transported to the US. Some Democratic lawmakers said the operation was an \"act of war\". In an interview with The Atlantic on Sunday, Trump said of Rodríguez: \"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"He added that for Venezuela,\"Regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can't get any worse\".Donald TrumpTrump posted a picture of Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima after his arrestOn Saturday, Trump had vowed the US would \"run\" the country until \"a safe and proper and judicious transition\" was possible. Trump also promised US oil companies would move into the country to fix infrastructure \"and start making money for the country\".Despite the US president's claims, Maduro's allies remain in charge.The Cuban government has said 32 \"brave Cuban combatants\" died when US forces attacked and captured Maduro and his wife. Cuba - a longstanding socialist ally of Maduro - has announced two days of national mourning.In several TV interviews on Sunday morning, Rubio defended the US's military operation in Venezuela, stressing the action did not mean the US is at war with the South American country. \"We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That's not a war against Venezuela,\" Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday morning.The secretary of state also told CBS that if Venezuela doesn't \"make the right decisions\", the US \"will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected\".That includes the \"quarantine\" the US has placed on Venezuela's oil, he said.\"We're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do,\" he added.Trump also threatened Venezuela's neighbour Colombia, in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One.He did not rule out military action against Colombia, saying \"it sounds good to me\", and called Colombian President Gustavo Petro \"a sick man\".\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump said.AFP via Getty ImagesArmed police officers stand in front of the Metropolitan Detention facility in the Brooklyn borough of New York, where ousted president Nicolás Maduro is being held.Maduro, who leads the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and has been in power since 2013, has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election.Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured at their compound and flown to the US, as part of a dramatic special forces operation in the early hours of Saturday that also saw strikes on military bases.The couple have since been charged with weapon and drug offences and are set to appear at a court in New York on Monday.Maduro has denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil.While US officials have said that no American troops were harmed in the attacks, Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team and \"soldiers and innocent civilians\" were killed in the US operation.When asked why congressional authorisation wasn't sought before the US operation in Venezuela, Rubio told ABC it \"wasn't necessary because this wasn't an invasion\".He described it as a \"law enforcement operation\", and said Maduro was arrested on the ground by FBI agents.You can't notify Congress of an operation like this because \"it will leak\", he added.Speaking to US media outlets, Rubio was asked if the US recognises Rodríguez as the legitimate president of Venezuela. He answered that \"this is not about the legitimate president\" as the US does not recognise the regime as legitimate.AFP via Getty ImagesFuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in Caracas on SaturdaySome Democratic lawmakers have condemned the administration's actions.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the secretive military operation, which was conducted without approval from Congress, \"was not simply a narcotics operation\".\"It was an act of war,\" Jeffries told NBC's Meet the Press. \"This was a military action involving Delta Force, involving the army, apparently involving thousands of troops, involving at least 150 military aircraft, perhaps involving dozens of ships off the coast of Venezuela and South America.\"Jim Himes, the most senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told CBS Face the Nation he had had \"zero outreach\" from the Trump administration, adding \"no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach\".In an interview with ABC This Week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned the legality of the US operation.Schumer said that while he believes Maduro is a horrible person, \"You don't treat lawlessness with other lawlessness\". \"We have learned through the years when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and in dollars,\" Schumer said. Both Schumer and Jeffries vowed to support a resolution that, if passed in both houses, would prohibit Trump from taking any further action in Venezuela without Congressional approval. In a joint statement, the governments of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay and Spain said the US's military actions \"constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population\".Additional reporting by Laurence Peter",

    "body": "South Korea's 'movie of the year' is an indie story about a teen's trauma  17 hours agoJuna Moon,BBC Korean, SeoulandFan Wang,BBC News, SingaporeWatch: Yoon Ga-eun talks to the BBC about her film, The World of LoveYoon Ga-eun was not a name many would have recognised in South Korea.That is until her movie about a teenager who is a survivor of sexual violence became a dark-horse hit.\"It hasn't really sunk in yet,\" indie filmmaker Ms Yoon told BBC Korean at a studio in Seoul in late November. \"Now I just feel almost blank - just grateful, and also a bit scared.\"The World of Love has been dubbed the \"movie of the year\" by Korean media for its touching, empathetic portrayal of life after trauma. Instead of recreating the crime, the movie tells the story of what comes after: the everyday life of high-schooler Joo-in, from  school to romance to family and friendships, and all the moments of conflict and joy that go along with it.It has earned the praise of critics and audiences, and more than $1.1m in box office revenue since its debut in October. Viewers have given it a 9 out of 10 on South Korea's largest search portal, Naver.\"Simply a masterpiece,\" is how Bong Jun-ho, director of the globally acclaimed film Parasite and the first Korean to win an Oscar, described it. He called himself the \"head of the Seoul branch of Yoon Ga-eun's fan club\".The film has resonated in a deeply patriarchal country, where women say they fight hard just to be heard. And its surprising success is a sign of the growing willingness to engage in conversations about sexual violence and how survivors are treated.'That's not all I am'The World of Love may not seem like an obvious choice for movie-goers.The Korean title, \"Joo-in of the World\", says little about the plot. While it stars Parasite actor Jang Hye-jin and K-drama star Go Min-si, the lead is played by Seo Su-bin, a new face on the big screen.At its heart, this is a story about the the life of 17-year-old Joo-in.Everything is going well for her. She is popular at school, has a devoted boyfriend, and lives with a caring mum and adorable younger brother.Getty ImagesSeo Su-bin (left) debuts in the film's lead role as high-schooler Joo-inTension begins over her refusal to sign a petition at school. A man who assaulted a 10-year-old child is about to be released from jail into her neighbourhood. So a  fellow student starts a petition calling for the suspension of his release. Joo-in is the only one who refuses to sign.She objects to a single line in the petition: \"Sexual violence leaves deep wounds that never heal and completely destroys a person's life and soul.\"\"I can't agree with this statement,\" Joo-in tells the student who drafted it.The standoff ends up revealing her secret: she was raped by a relative when she was  younger.Despite the harrowing theme, Ms Yoon is determined to explore the fullness of Joo-in's life, whose name means \"owner\" or \"master\" in Korean, alluding to the autonomy Ms Yoon envisioned for her character.Journalists who attended the media screening received a hand-written letter from Ms Yoon asking them to avoid mentioning sexual violence while covering the film.\"The story is more about how we look at her,\" Ms Yoon explained to the BBC, adding that she didn't want to pin a label - childhood sexual abuse survivor - on her protagonist.\"Because Joo-in herself refuses that. It's one part of her identity and it shakes her, but she insists, 'That's not all I am'.\"When she decided to make a film about sexual violence, Ms Yoon was clear about one thing. She did not want it to be predictable.During her research, she said she \"watched pretty much everything that was out there\" on this subject. She spoke with survivors and consulted activists. Those conversations shattered the \"prejudice\" she carried, an ignorance that \"reduces a person entirely to their wound\".\"We spent so much time talking about completely ordinary concerns,\" she said. \"Worries about work, family, friendships and romances, about needing to lose weight or gain weight or exercise more. I think those moments dissolved even that last tiny bit of prejudice I still had.\"Barunson E&AThe World of Love is South Korea's highest-grossing indie film of 2025This touched audiences.Those who liked the film say it challenges the stereotypes we project onto survivors of sexual crimes, encouraging audiences to see them differently - people who are part of society and trying to live their lives like everyone else.When Seo Jinwon, a children's book editor watched the film in Seoul, she said, the cinema \"fell completely silent\" as the film ended. \"No-one rushed to leave. I stayed and watched the end credits. I walked out of the cinema thinking, 'I want to be a good adult who can stand beside all the children and teenagers who are trying so hard to grow up'.\"A sexual violence survivor who wished to remain anonoymous said she had an urge to \"stretch my arms and cheer\" when she walked out of the cinema. \"Joo-in gave me so much. At the end, it felt like she was smiling at me and saying, 'I am living well, so let's keep living well together'.\"The right momentThe World of Love is doing what activists have long worked towards, according to Cho Eunhee, director of Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center who worked as a consultant on the film. The timing, she added, \"is incredibly right\". AFP via Getty ImagesSouth Korean women at a demonstration on International Women's Day in 2018 After the 2017–2018 MeToo movement, it became easier for survivors to share their stories, and the country grew more protective and understanding towards them. By 2025, when Ms Yoon's film was released, \"people were more prepared to empathise with a story like this,\" Ms Cho said. She wonders if, even a few years earlier, the film would have \"found this level of public understanding\".While the MeToo movement sparked conversations about harassment and assaults in workplaces and outside the home, exposing abuse within families, she said, is still widely seen as \"spitting in one's own face\" - but this movie has made more room to talk about it.  The World of Love is not without its critics. Some viewers, including survivors, said it felt unrepresentative of their reality because it downplayed the fear and lasting damage of abuse, portraying families as more supportive than they often were.But criticism does not overshadow the film's value, critic Min Youngjun said, adding that The World of Love has created a healthy space for talking about sexual violence and its victims.  \"The mark of a good film is not how many people liked it versus didn't like it. What matters is whether it creates a space in which we can talk to each other about what it has put on the table.\"",

    "body": "Nasry Asfura has been declared the winner of Honduras's presidential election, after weeks of delays following technical problems and allegations of fraud. The conservative National Party candidate - backed by US President Donald Trump - won with 40.3% of the vote, according to the National Electoral Council (CNE), edging out Salvador Nasralla of the centre-right Liberal Party, who got 39.5%. In a post on X,  Asfura said, \"Honduras: I am ready to govern. I will not let you down.\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged all parties to respect the result \"so that Honduran authorities may ensure a peaceful transition of authority\".  But the president of the country's Congress, Luis Redondo, posted saying the result was \"completely illegal\".The vote was held on 30 November but the count was delayed twice by technical outages, which electoral officials called \"inexcusable\".The president of the CNE, Ana Paola Hall, blamed the private company tasked with tabulating the results for the delay.She said the firm had carried out maintenance without warning or checking with the CNE.The stoppage came a day after the portal displaying real-time results had crashed.Results of the election were tight and, due to the tumultuous nature of the processing system, around 15% of the tally sheets had to be counted by hand for the winner to be decided. There have been tensions in Honduras as a result of the delays with protests held across the country last week. Thousands of supporters of the governing Libre party demonstrated in the capital Tegucigalpa over what they considered fraud in the vote.  The outgoing President, Xiomara Castro, had alleged that an \"electoral coup\" was taking place and earlier this month said the election was being marred by \"interference\" from Trump. When he endorsed Asfura for president, Trump said there would be \"hell to pay\" if his very narrow lead was overturned in the count. He also threatened to withdraw financial support from the US if Asfura didn't win.In a surprise move, the US president also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernandez, a member of Asfura's National Party, who was serving 45 year jail sentence in the US on drug and weapons charges.  Xiomara Castro was barred by the constitution from standing for a second term.Nine days after the vote, Nasralla accused \"corrupt people\" of manipulating the vote count in the Central American nation. He also said Trump's comments had damaged his chances of winning.  In his statement following the announcement of the result, Rubio said the US would \"look forward to working with his incoming administration to advance our bilateral and regional security co-operation\", adding the two countries would \"end illegal immigration to the United States\", while strengthening economic ties.

    "body": "Bomb blast in packed Nigerian mosque kills five47 minutes agoJamie WhiteheadReutersInjured people were taken to a local hospitalAt least five people have been killed in a bomb explosion in a packed mosque in Nigeria's north-eastern Borno state, a police spokesman has said.Nahum Daso told local media another 35 people were injured in the blast in the Gamboru market of Maiduguri, the state capital, during evening prayers. Unverified footage on social media appears to show the aftermath of the explosion, with people stood in a market area with dust particles in the air. No group has admitted carrying out the attack, but militants have previously targeted mosques and crowded places in the area with suicide attacks and improvised explosive devices (IED).Maiduguri has been central to an insurgency by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province. Military operations by Boko Haram to create an Islamic caliphate in Borno state began in 2009. Security measures against the group have failed to prevent sporadic attacks against civilians in north-east Nigeria. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoNomsa MasekoandEmma RossiterEleven suspects have been arrested in connection with a mass shooting that left nine people dead at a tavern in South Africa on Sunday.Police launched a manhunt for the 12 unidentified gunmen who had opened fire at patrons at around 01:00 local time (23:00 GMT Saturday) in the Bekkersdal establishment, near Johannesburg.On Wednesday, provincial deputy commissioner of police, Major General Fred Kekana said nine of the arrested suspects are Lesotho nationals, while one is from Mozambique.Another suspect, believed to be a South African mineworker, was also detained.Murders in South Africa – which has one of the highest rates in the world - are often the result of arguments, robberies and gang violence.While the attack appeared \"unprovoked\" at the time, preliminary investigations now appear to suggest a motive linked to illegal mining turf wars.During the attack, gunmen continued to shoot as people fled the tavern, killing two as well as a taxi driver who had dropped off a passenger nearby.Upon making the arrests, several unlicensed firearms including an AK-47 rifle, were found in the suspects' possession.There are about 3m legally held firearms in South Africa and at least the same number of unlicensed weapons, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association, Although 2025 has seen a decline in reported mass shootings, there has been a significant increase in incidents where four or more people are either killed or injured since 2020, Claire Taylor, a researcher at campaign group Gun Free South Africa, told the BBC.Among the most common locations for these attacks are licensed taverns or illegal drinking spots, known locally as shebeens.Sunday's shooting occurred just two weeks after another attack at the Saulsville Hostel in the capital Pretoria, where eleven people including a three-year-old child were killed.",

    "body": "The Libyan army chief has been killed in an air crash in Turkey, Libya's prime minister has said.Gen Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad was on board a Falcon 50 aircraft flying out of the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Tuesday evening. He was killed along with four other military officials and three crew members.Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said signal with the business jet was lost at 20:52 local time (17:52 GMT) - about 42 minutes after it took off from Ankara's airport. The Tripoli-bound jet had issued an emergency landing request before contact was lost. The aircraft's wreckage was later found south-west of Ankara, and its voice recorder and black box had been recovered.The emergency services are still trying to retrieve the bodies. An investigation is under way into what caused the crash.In a post on X, Yerlikaya wrote that police had spotted the debris near the village of Kesikkavak, in the Haymana district.In Libya, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, the prime minister of the country's internationally-recognised Government of National Unity (GNU), said he had received news of the deaths of Gen Haddad and other senior Libyan military officials on board the jet.The prime minister called it a \"great loss\" for the nation, saying Libya had \"lost men who served their country with sincerity and dedication\".Gen Haddad and his team had been in Turkey for talks aimed at further strengthening military and security co-operation between the two countries.Turkey has played an increasingly dominant role in Libya after intervening in 2019 to prevent an army from the east of the country driving out the internationally-recognised government in Tripoli, and has built close political, military and economic ties.Libya's rival Government of National Stability (GNS) in the east of the country is run by military strongman Khalifa Haftar. The north African has been battered by many armed groups who emerged after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.A series of armed uprisings that led to the long-time dictator's killing created a security vacuum, with much of the country lawless and chaotic since.Additional reporting  by Farouk Chothia",

    "body": "9 hours agoGabriela PomeroyandAnastasiia Levchenko,Kyiv Three people - including two police officers - have been killed in an explosion in Moscow, Russian authorities have said. Two traffic police officers saw a \"suspicious individual\" near a police car on the city's Yeletskaya Street, and when they approached the suspect to detain him, an explosive device was detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee has said. Reports in Russia say the third person killed was the suspect, but this has not been officially confirmed. The blast took place close to the location where a senior Russian general was killed in a car bombing in the capital on Monday. Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died after an explosive device - which had been planted under a car - was detonated.Investigate Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement on Telegram that a criminal case was being investigated in Moscow \"regarding an attempt on the lives of traffic police officers\". The officers have been named by Russian media as Ilya Klimanov, 24, and Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Sources in Ukraine's military intelligence agency, HUR, told the BBC that a local resident, eliminated two representatives of the Russian law enforcement agency, \"as a sign of disagreement with the Kremlin's aggressive policy\" and said that a man \"threw an explosive package through the car window, causing an explosion\".According to the HUR sources, two other people were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Ukrainian military sources also told the BBC on Wednesday that the two officers killed had \"participated in hostilities against Ukraine,\" and added there was \"evidence of their involvement in the torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war\".There are no details and Moscow has not commented. Speaking to Reuters news agency, Alexander, a resident who lives close by, said: \"There was an explosion.\"It was loud bang - like with the car a few days ago.\"Russia said it suspected Ukraine was behind Monday's explosion, without providing any evidence. However Ukraine has not said whether it was involved in Fanil Sarvarov's death.It is also not known whether the two explosions are linked. Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department.He was the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.",

    "body": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has asked an appeals court to release him from prison and overturn his conviction on two prostitution-related crimes.In a court filing for an expedited appeal, the rap mogul's attorney argued that he was improperly sentenced, and that the conduct that resulted in his conviction was not criminal in nature.Attorney Alexandra Shapiro called Combs' 50-month prison sentence \"unlawful, unconstitutional, and a perversion of justice\". She asked an appeals court to order that Combs be resentenced, should the panel choose not to throw out his conviction in its entirety. The request is the latest attempt by his team to reduce his sentence or throw out his conviction.The Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Combs, declined to comment on the request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.Combs' lawyers had previously said they would appeal his sentence and conviction.Federal prosecutors in New York accused Combs of using his money, power, and the threat of violence to coerce women into unwanted sexual encounters.During a high-profile trial this spring, the jury heard from two of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified as \"Jane Doe\". They said Combs abused them and forced them to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.The jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. They convicted him of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.In September, after his conviction, Combs asked Judge Arun Subramanian to consider an acquittal or new trial, citing objections over the way an anti-prostitution statute known as the Mann Act was used to prosecute Combs. That bid was not successful.Ahead of his sentencing, Combs' attorneys argued he should receive a brief sentence that would essentially amount to time served, a request that would have paved the way for a swift release. Prosecutors, however, asked the judge to send Combs to prison for at least 11 years.US District Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. He said he considered Combs' contributions to society and testimonials from family and friends, but \"a history of good works can't wash away your record\".Combs' appeal argues that Judge Subramanian did not properly follow sentencing guidelines when sending him to 50-months in prison.It argues the judge \"flouted\" new guidelines and improperly considered conduct for which Combs had been acquitted when formulating his punishment. The filing argues the judge \"acted as a thirteenth juror\" in the case and calls the sentence \"draconian\". Before Judge Subramanian issued his sentence, Combs apologized to Ms Ventura and \"Jane.\"\"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,\" Combs said. \"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego.\"Combs is also facing dozens of pending civil lawsuits, which accuse him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. Many of the lawsuits allege that the rapper used his fame and power to silence accusers through threats. Some detail allegations that the rapper - or those who worked for him - drugged people at parties before alleged assaults. Representatives for Mr Combs have repeatedly said he \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor\".",

    "body": "Algeria's parliament has unanimously passed a law declaring France's colonisation of the North African state a crime, and demanding an apology and reparations. The law also criminalises the glorification of colonialism, state-run TV reports.The vote is the latest sign of increasingly strained diplomatic relations between the two countries, with some observers saying they are at their lowest since Algeria gained independence 63 years ago.France's colonisation of Algeria between 1830 and 1962 was marked by mass killings, large-scale deportations and ended in a bloody war of independence. Algeria says the war killed 1.5 million people, while French historians put the death toll much lower.France's President Emmanuel Macron has previously acknowledged the colonisation of Algeria was a \"crime against humanity\" but has not offered an apology.Lawmakers wore scarves in the colours of the national flag and chanted \"long live Algeria\" as they applauded the bill's passage through parliament, AFP news agency reports.It says the legislation states that France has \"legal responsibility\" for the \"tragedies it caused\", and \"full and fair\" compensation was an \"inalienable right of the Algerian state and people\". France has not yet commented on the vote. It comes at a time of growing pressure on Western powers to offer reparations for slavery and colonialism, and to return looted artefacts still kept in their museums.Algerian lawmakers have been demanding that France return a 16th Century bronze canon, known as Baba Merzoug, meaning \"Blessed Father\", that was regarded as the protector of Algiers, now Algeria's capital.French forces captured the city in 1830, on their third attempt, and removed the cannon - which is now in the port city of Brest in north-western France.In 2020, France returned the remains of 24 Algerian fighters who were killed resisting French colonial forces in the 19th Century.Last month, Algeria hosted a conference of African states to push for justice and reparations.Algeria's Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said that a legal framework would ensure that restitution was neither regarded as \"a gift nor a favour\".Diplomatic relations between between Algeria and France soured last year, when Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal was then arrested at Algiers airport in  and jailed for five years, before being pardoned by Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune last month.Prosecutors said he had undermined national security for making remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.",

    "body": "Two British campaigners are among five people denied US visas after the State Department accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" American tech platforms into suppressing free speech.Imran Ahmed, an ex-Labour adviser who now heads the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), and Clare Melford, CEO of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), were labelled \"radical activists\" by the Trump administration and banned from entering the US.A French ex-EU commissioner and two senior figures at a Germany-based anti-online hate group were also denied visas.European leaders have condemned the measures, while the UK government said it is \"fully committed\" to upholding free speech.\"While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content,\" a UK government spokesperson said.French President Emmanuel Macron described the travel ban as \"intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty\" while the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"unacceptable and an attempt to challenge our sovereignty\".The US billed the measures as a response to people and organisations that have campaigned for restrictions on American tech firms, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying they belonged to a \"global censorship-industrial complex\".He said: \"President Trump has been clear that his America First foreign policy rejects violations of American sovereignty. Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception.\"Ahmed from the CCDH, which says it advocates for government action against hate speech and disinformation online, has links to senior Labour figures. He was previously an aide to Labour minister Hilary Benn, and Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has served as a director of the group he founded.The US government labelled Ahmed a \"collaborator\" for the CCDH's purported past work with the Biden administration. BBC News has contacted the CCDH for comment.Melford founded the GDI, a non-profit that monitors the spread of disinformation, in 2018.US Undersecretary of State Sarah B Rogers accused the GDI of using US taxpayer money \"to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press\". A GDI spokesperson told the BBC that \"the visa sanctions announced today are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\".\"The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\"Also targeted was Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, who suggested that a \"witch hunt\" was taking place.Breton was described by the State Department as the \"mastermind\" of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation on social media firms. However, it has angered some US conservatives who see it as seeking to censor right-wing opinions. Brussels denies this.Breton has clashed with Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of X, over obligations to follow EU rules.The European Commission recently fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges - the first fine under the DSA. It said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".In response, Musk's site blocked the Commission from sharing adverts on its platform.Reacting to the visa ban, Breton posted on X: \"To our American friends: Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"Also subject to bans were Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organisation that the State Department said helped enforce the DSA.In a statement to the BBC, the two CEOs called it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary\". They added: \"We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "1 hour agoMadeline HalpertWatch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy CenterDemocratic US Representative Joyce Beatty has filed a lawsuit seeking to remove President Donald Trump's name from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy Center. Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was illegal because changing the name requires \"an act of Congress\". The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. Beatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a \"living memorial\" to former President Kennedy. \"[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump,\" the lawsuit states.In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had \"stepped up\" and saved the Kennedy Center \"by strengthening its finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke programming\". \"As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America's most iconic cultural institutions,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. On Friday, the president's name was added to the exterior of the building, and the centre's website logo now reads \"The Trump Kennedy Center\".The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for Kennedy.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesConstruction began on a performing arts centre in the 1950s and after Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to name it after him.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired a slew of the centre's board members and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make him chairman of the board. His close adviser Richard Grenell became board president.The centre's board of trustees currently has 34 members appointed by Trump and 23 others designated as members by US law, according to the centre's website. Trump also secured about $257m (£190m) in congressional funding to pay for major renovations and other costs at the venue, saying it was in \"bad shape\". Several members of the Kennedy family took to social media to criticise the name change. Joe Kennedy III, a former House member and grandnephew of the late president, said that \"the Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".\"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he added.",

    "description": "US authorities have discovered more than a million more documents potentially related to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein that they plan to release",
    "body": "US authorities have discovered more than a million more documents potentially related to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein that they plan to release in the coming days and weeks, officials say.The FBI and federal prosecutors in New York informed the Department of Justice (DoJ) of the discovery.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,\" the DoJ said on Wednesday.The department said it could take \"a few more weeks\" before all the files are released. The DoJ has been under scrutiny after not releasing all Epstein files by 19 December, the deadline mandated under a new law.The agency said it would \"continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump's direction to release the files\". The statement did not specify how the FBI and the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York came across the additional material. Epstein had been facing charges of sex trafficking minors in the state when he died awaiting trial in a New York prison. The news comes after the justice department released thousands of documents - some heavily redacted - related to their investigations into Epstein. The department has been releasing the documents in batches and top officials have said hundreds of thousands of documents still are to be released. Who and what are in the Epstein files?Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The disgraced financier with powerful associatesTrump trips, a fake video and 10 possible co-conspirators: Takeaways from new Epstein filesThe files were released after Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act - signed into law by US President Donald Trump - that ordered the agency to share all the documents with the public while protecting victims' identities. Many of the released documents, which include videos, photos, emails and investigative documents, have heavy redactions, including names of people the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case.The justice department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations. In a post on X after the discovery of the additional documents was announced, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, a congressional panel that has been investigating the Epstein saga, accused the White House of “illegally” withholding the files.“Every day we see lies, incompetence, missed deadlines, and illegal redactions,” Representative Robert Garcia said in a statement. The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".Included in the documents are emails appearing to be exchanged between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein.The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the justice department.Previous releases of Epstein documents have included revelations that reverberated across the Atlantic. Andrew and Epstein is the story that will not go awayAndrew stripped of 'prince' title and will move out of Royal LodgePeter Mandelson: Rise and fall of Labour's political fixerPeter Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US after details emerged about his friendship with the convicted paedophile, and that he told Epstein \"I think the world of you\", the day before Epstein began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008.Lord Mandelson said in a letter to staff that \"I deeply regret\" the circumstances of his departure from the British embassy in Washington DC. He said being ambassador had been \"the privilege of my life\" and he continued \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein twenty years ago and the plight of his victims\".In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost his prince title and was asked to leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following prolonged scrutiny over his links to Epstein. In the latest release of files on Tuesday, a 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" from \"Balmoral\" to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell - who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences- asks: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\"The BBC has contacted Andrew's team for a response. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorGetty ImagesZelensky said the 20 points agreed with the Americans offered Ukraine security guarantees that mirrored Nato membershipUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has given details of an updated peace plan offering Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarised zone in their place.Detailing the 20-point plan agreed by US and Ukrainian envoys in Florida at the weekend, Zelensky said the Russians would respond on Wednesday once the Americans had spoken to them.Describing the plan as \"the main framework for ending the war\", he said it proposed security guarantees from the US, Nato and Europeans for a co-ordinated military response if Russia invaded Ukraine again.On the key question of Ukraine's eastern Donbas, Zelensky said a \"free economic zone\" was a potential option.He told journalists that as Ukraine was against withdrawal, US negotiators were looking to establish a demilitarised zone or a free economic zone. Any area that Ukrainian troops pulled out of would have to be policed by Ukraine, he stressed. \"There are two options,\" Zelensky said, \"either the war continues, or something will have to be decided regarding all potential economic zones.\"The 20-point plan is seen as an update of an original 28-point document, agreed by US envoy Steve Witkoff with the Russians several weeks ago, which was widely seen as heavily geared towards the Kremlin's demands.The Russians have insisted that Ukraine pulls out of almost a quarter of its own territory in the eastern Donetsk region in return for a peace deal. The rest is already under Russian occupation.Sensitive issues including questions over territory would have to be resolved \"at the leaders' level\", but the new draft would provide Ukraine with strong security guarantees and a military strength of 800,000, Zelensky explained.Much of the updated plan resembles what came out of recent talks in Berlin involving US negotiators Witkoff and Jared Kushner with Ukrainian and European leaders. The setting then moved to Miami last weekend where US President Donald Trump's team spoke separately to Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and then Ukrainian and European officials.There now appears to be far more detail on the territorial issue, although it is clear the Ukrainian side was unable to reach a consensus with the Americans.Zelensky explained that if Ukraine was prepared to pull its heavy forces back by five, 10 or 40km in the 25% of Donetsk it still held to create an economic zone, making it virtually demilitarised, then Russia would have to do the same \"accordingly by five, 10, or 40km\".Russian troops are currently about 40km (25 miles) east of Ukraine's \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, having captured the town of Siversk.Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to be impressed by the kind of compromise being proposed for Donetsk. He said this month that Russia would take control of the entire east of Ukraine by force if Ukrainian troops did not pull out.However, Trump is pushing for a deal to end almost four years of full-scale war and the Ukrainian president believes Russia cannot afford to reject the US plan.\"They cannot tell President Trump, 'look we're against a peaceful settlement',\" Zelensky told reporters. \"If they try to obstruct everything, then President Trump would have to arm us heavily, while imposing all possible sanctions against them.\"Zelensky made clear that if a free economic zone were established in Donetsk it would have to be under Ukrainian administration and police - \"definitely not the so-called Russian police\". The current front line would then become the boundary of the economic zone with international forces on the ground along the contact line to ensure no Russian infiltration.Russia has so far rejected a European proposal to police any peace deal through a Coalition of the Willing as a \"brazen threat\".A referendum would need to be held on the whole peace plan, Zelensky said, and only a referendum could decide on the idea of a potential free economic zone in Donbas.He emphasised that an economic zone would also have to be set up around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant currently occupied by Russia, and that Russian troops would have to pull out of four other Ukrainian regions - Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv.The current US proposal for the nuclear plant would be for Ukraine, the US and Russia to operate it jointly, but Kyiv disagreed with that, Zelensky said.The main points of the plan reaffirm Ukraine's sovereignty and propose a non-aggression pact between Russia and its neighbour with a monitoring mechanism.As well as strong security guarantees mirroring Nato's Article Five, which requires members to aid an ally under attack, Ukraine is to be allowed a maximum military strength of 800,000 in peacetime.Discussions are still going on over a US plan to receive compensation in return for security guarantees, so Zelensky says it is not currently part of the document.There is no reference barring Ukraine from joining Nato, which was in the original 28-point plan and something Russia has consistently demanded.And the latest framework proposes that Ukraine joins the European Union with a defined date of accession. It is currently a candidate, but a number of other candidate countries are seen as first in line, such as Albania.There are plans for a Ukraine investment fund of about $200bn (£150bn) involving both the US and Europe.Among the other points is a requirement for Ukraine to hold elections as soon as possible after the deal is signed. Russia and the US have both pushed for a vote, even though Ukraine is under martial law because of the full-scale invasion. ",

    "body": "Venezuela has accused the United States of the \"greatest extortion\" at an emergency session of the UN Security Council in New York.  Washington's seizure of two Venezuelan oil tankers was \"worse than piracy,\" the Venezuelan ambassador to the UN said. The emergency meeting of the Security Council was called to discuss the seizure of the tankers, which took place off the coast of Venezuela earlier this month. The US has also said it was pursuing a third Venezuelan oil tanker. President Trump has accused Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drugs cartel and said gangs had operated with impunity for too long.On 16 December, Trump ordered a naval blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. The US president has said the US will keep or sell the crude oil it has taken, as well as the vessels themselves.The US has been building up its military presence in the Pacific and Caribbean Seas in recent months, sending 15,000 troops and a range of aircraft carriers and warships to the area. It is the largest deployment to the region since the US invaded Panama in 1989, and the stated aim is to stop the flow of fentanyl and cocaine to the US.The US has carried out strikes on what it says are Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, targeting more than 20 vessels and killing at least 100 people. Some experts say the strikes could violate laws governing armed conflict.Venezuela's envoy to the UN said the US was subjecting his country to the \"greatest extortion\" in its history. Speaking at the UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday, Samuel Moncada said \"we are in the presence of a power that acts outside of international law, demanding that Venezuelans vacate our country and hand it over.\"Regarding the US seizure of Venezuelan oil, he added: \"We are talking about pillaging, looting and recolonisation of Venezuela. \"The government of the United States does not have jurisdiction in the Caribbean.\"Referring to the Venezuelan oil industry, he said: \"What does that have to do with drugs?\"In response, the US Ambassador to the UN, Michael Waltz, told the Security Council the US does not recognise Mr Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.\"Maduro's ability to sell Venezuela's oil enables his fraudulent claims to power and his narco-terrorist activities,\" Mr Waltz said. On a visit to a trade fair in Caracas, President Maduro said \"the Security Council is giving overwhelming support to Venezuela.\"Russia and China accused the US of bullying and aggression.The US was \"illegally destroying\" civilian vessels in the Caribbean Sea, the Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the UN meeting. He warned that other countries could be next. The US actions against Venezuelan vessels, he said, were \"a template for future acts of force against Latin American states.\"Meanwhile, China's envoy to the UN, Sun Lei, called on the US to \"immediately halt relevant actions and avoid further escalation of tensions.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoAleks PhillipsSSGGeorgian security service footage shows armed soldiers detaining three individualsThree Chinese nationals have been arrested in Georgia on suspicion of attempting to illegally purchase 2kg of uranium.Lasha Maghradze, deputy head of the nation's State Security Service (SSG), told a news briefing the group planned to pay $400,000 (£300,570) for the nuclear material in the capital, Tblisi, before transporting it to China via Russia.The alleged plot was unearthed by intelligence agents while one member of the group was attempting to buy the radioactive substance on the black market, he said.The three pleaded not guilty at a court in Tblisi and have been placed in custody to prevent them fleeing the country, according to public broadcaster Georgia Today.They face up to five years in prison under a provision of Georgia's criminal code banning the purchasing of nuclear material.Mr Maghradze told reporters the operation was being co-ordinated by other members of the group in China.SSG footage shows armed soldiers swooping on a car and detaining three individuals.It also shows two glass jars containing a yellow substance in a car boot, which tests identified as uranium. SSGAuthorities found two jars containing uranium in a car bootIt is unclear what isotope of uranium the men are alleged to have sought - though all can emit harmful radiation - and their intended purpose for it.As a former Soviet nation, Georgia had stores of nuclear materials following the bloc's collapse in 1991.The security of those materials has been an ongoing concern, with several serious incidents of uranium being illicitly sold in the years since.In July, the SSG arrested two people - one Georgian and one Turkish national - for attempting to trade $3m worth of uranium.",

    "body": "Russia has tested the nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, Moscow's top general has said.\"We have launched a multi-hour flight of a nuclear-powered missile and it covered a 14,000km (8,700-mile) distance, which is not the limit,\" Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting.The low-flying experimental weapon, first announced in 2018, has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.Western experts have previously cast doubt over missile's strategic value and Russian claims of having successfully tested it.Putin said a \"final successful test\" of the weapon had been held in 2023, but the claim could not be independently verified. Of at least 13 known tests, only two had partial success since 2016, according to an arms control campaign group.Gen Gerasimov said the missile was in the air for 15 hours during the test on 21 October. He said the missile's vertical and horizontal manoevreing were tested and were found to be up to specification, according to Russia's Tass news agency.\"Therefore, it demonstrated high capabilities to bypass missile and air defence systems,\" Tass reported Gen Gerasimov as saying.The missile's utility has been the subject of intense debate in military and defences circles since it was first announced in 2018.A 2021 report by the US Air Force's National Air and Space Intelligence Center concluded: \"A nuclear-powered cruise missile would give Russia a unique weapon with intercontinental range capability.\"However, as the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) noted the same year, Russia faces significant challenges in making the weapon viable.\"Its entry into Russia's inventory arguably hinges not only on overcoming the considerable technical challenge of ensuring the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit,\" IISS analysts wrote.\"There have been numerous flight-test failures, and an accident resulting in several deaths.\"A Russian military journal quoted in the IISS report claims the missile has a range of between 10,000 and 20,000km, allowing \"the missile to be based anywhere in Russia and still be able to reach targets in the continental US\".The same journal also says the missile can fly as low as 50 to 100 metres above ground, making it difficult for air defences to intercept.The missile, code-named Skyfall by Nato, is thought to be powered by a nuclear reactor, which is supposed to activate after solid fuel rocket boosters have launched it into the air.An investigation by news agency Reuters last year identified a facility 475km (295 miles) north of Moscow as the likely launch site of the weapon.Using satellite imagery from August 2024, analyst Decker Eveleth told Reuters he had identified nine horizontal launch pads under construction at the site.",

    "body": "Three people have been killed and at least 32 others injured in an overnight Russian air attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the city's mayor has said.Two high-rise residential buildings were hit in the strikes, Vitali Klitschko said, adding in a Telegram post that six children were among the injured.Meanwhile, Russian air defences destroyed two drones heading towards Moscow on Sunday, according to the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin.The latest Russian bombardment comes as Moscow has stepped up attacks on civilian targets and energy infrastructure ahead of winter, with Ukrainian authorities saying nearly 1,200 drones have been launched in the past week alone.Officials in Kyiv said the three people were killed when a drone struck a nine-storey residential building in the Desnianskyi district to the north-west of the city, with 24 others injured in the same attack.Damage was also reported to at least three other residential buildings in Kyiv. Seven people including two children are being treated in hospital, officials said.Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022, and it currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.There has been marginal movement along the front lines as fighting on the ground continues, while Ukraine has sought to hurt Russia's warfighting ability by striking its military production plants and oil facilities that are essential to its economy.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently called on allies to supply his armed forces with long range weapons to continue doing so.However, he came away from a recent meeting at the White House and subsequent EU summit empty-handed.US President Donald Trump did announce new sanctions targeting Russia's largest oil companies this week - the first time he had done so in his current term - as did the EU.Trump said that talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin \"don't go anywhere\" as he shelved plans for the two to meet in Budapest over the war in Ukraine.On his way to Asia over the weekend, Trump said he had a \"great relationship\" with Putin but that recent events had been \"disappointing\", suggesting a meeting between the two was conditional on a peace deal being likely. Trump has appeared increasingly frustrated with Russian conditions for bringing the war to a close, with a summit in Alaska in August failing to yield any tangible results.The US president had previously said fresh sanctions on Moscow were contingent on European allies cutting their Russian energy imports. The EU has pledged to do so by 2028.Zelensky has agreed to a US proposal to cease fighting along the current front lines so peace negotiations can begin - though this falls short of Russian demands that Ukrainian forces completely withdraw from the eastern Donbas region.However, senior Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US officials in Washington on Friday and Saturday, told CNN that he believed Russia, Ukraine and the US were close to a diplomatic solution to end the war.\"It's a big move by President Zelensky to already acknowledge that it's about battle lines,\" Dmitriev said.\"You know, his previous position was that Russia should leave completely so actually, I think we are reasonably close to a diplomatic solution that can be worked out.\"Meanwhile, Russia said it conducted a test of an experimental nuclear-powered missile on Sunday, which has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.",

    "body": "An unnamed donor is giving $130m (£100m) to the Pentagon to help pay US troops during the government shutdown, sparking ethics concerns. US defence officials confirmed the gift, which President Donald Trump said will make up for shortfalls in paying the country's 1.32m service members, but declined to identify the donor.Trump provided a few clues, though, saying on Saturday that he was \"a big supporter of mine\" and a US citizen.The government shut down more than three weeks ago, after lawmakers failed to approve a funding deal. The Trump administration paid troops last week by shifting $8bn from military research, but it is unclear what will happen on the next payday at the end of the month.Now in its 26th day, the shutdown is poised to become one of the longest in US history.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday the US would probably be able to pay the military \"beginning in November\". \"But by November 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,\" he told Face the Nation, a talk show on CBS, the BBC's US news partner. \"What an embarrassment.\"The next military payday is scheduled for 31 October, at the end of this week.Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters on Friday that the donation \"was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members' salaries and benefits,\"  and it was allowed under the department's \"general gift acceptance authority\".Trump had indicated a donation would be made on Thursday, while also declining to identify the donor, saying \"he doesn't really want the recognition\".However, the New York Times has identified the benefactor as Timothy Mellon, a billionaire and major financial backer of Trump.Mr Mellon is the heir to his influential family's $15bn (£11bn) fortune, according to Forbes, and was heavily involved in the US railway industry before recently becoming more politically active and donating $50m to a group supporting Trump.Before leaving for Asia on Saturday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the donor was a \"great gentleman\", a \"patron\", a \"patriot\" and a \"wonderful man\" who \"doesn't want publicity\".\"He prefers that his name not be mentioned, which is pretty unusual in the world I come from,\" Trump said. \"In the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.\" \"He put up $130 million in order to make sure - that's a lot of money - in order to make sure that the military got paid, and he's a big supporter of mine,\" he continued.The funds amount to around $100 per servicemember. The White House was able to reallocate some military research funds to make the last military payday, while lawmakers in Congress have tried, and so far failed, to pass a bill that would keep troops being paid during the shutdown.Most government workers have been furloughed, or in some cases, told to work without pay while the shutdown lasts. According to Defence Department rules, donations over $10,000 must be reviewed by ethics officials \"to determine whether the donor is involved in any claims, procurement actions, litigation, or other particular matters involving the Department that must be considered prior to gift acceptance\".Donations from non-American citizens require additional scrutiny. While unusual, the Pentagon does sometimes accept gifts from donors, but they normally must be given to fund specific projects, such as a school, hospital, library, museum, or cemetery. Critics questioned why the US military would accept anonymous funds.  \"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" said Delaware Senator Chris Coons, the top Democrat on the Senate's defense appropriations subcommittee.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterReutersThe US and China have agreed the framework of a potential trade deal that will be discussed when their respective leaders meet later this week, the US treasury secretary has said.Scott Bessent told the BBC's US news partner CBS that this included a \"final deal\" on TikTok's US operations and a deferral on China's tightened rare earth minerals controls.He also said he did not anticipate the 100% tariff on Chinese goods threatened by US President Donald Trump coming into force, while China will resume substantial soybean purchases from the US.Both nations are seeking to avoid further escalation in a trade war between the world's two largest economies.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to hold talks on Thursday in South Korea.Bessent met senior Chinese trade officials on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, which Trump is also attending as part of a tour of Asia. Beijing said they had \"constructive\" discussions.Bessent said the countries had \"reached a substantial framework for the two leaders\", adding: \"The tariffs will be averted.\"The Chinese government said in a statement that both negotiating teams \"reached a basic consensus on arrangements to address their respective concerns\".\"Both sides agreed to further finalise specific details,\" they added.Trump's tariff tacticsSince Trump re-entered the White House, he has imposed and threatened sweeping tariffs on imports from overseas on various countries, arguing that the policy would help boost US manufacturing and jobs. The introduction of tariffs has resulted in many countries, including the UK, agreeing new deals with the US.But the steepest levies he has threatened have been levelled at China. Beijing has hit back with measures of its own, though the two agreed to hold off implementing the levies while pursuing a trade deal.However, earlier this month Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tarriff on Chinese goods from November in response to China tightening restrictions on export of rare earths - materials essential to the production of many electronics. The US president accused Beijing of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\".China processes around 90% of the world's rare earths, which go into everything from solar panels to smartphones, making supply of them to US manufacturers a key bargaining chip.The last time Beijing tightened export controls - after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods early this year - there was an outcry from many US firms reliant on the materials.China will \"delay that for a year while they re-examine it\", Bessent told a different news show, This Week, on Sunday.Another issue of contention is soybeans, of which China is the world's biggest buyer. As the trade war began heating up, China halted all orders, hurting US farmers.Bessent hinted the boycott may soon be over but refused to give details.\"I'm actually a soybean farmer, so I have felt this pain too... I think we have addressed the farmers' concerns,\" he said on This Week.\"I believe when the announcement of the deal with China is made public that our soybean farmers will feel really good about what's going on for this season and the coming seasons for several years.\"TikTok deal done?Bessent also said a deal had been agreed on video-sharing platform TikTok's US arm, with Trump and Xi left to \"consummate that transaction on Thursday\".The US has sought to prise the app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance over national security concerns.TikTok was previously told it had to sell its US operations or risk being shut down, but Trump has delayed implementing the ban four times to facilitate negotiations, and has extended the deadline again to December.The White House announced last month that US companies would control TikTok's algorithm and Americans would hold six of seven board seats for the app's US operations.While Trump initially called for TikTok to be banned during his first term, he has since changed course. He turned to the hugely popular platform to boost his support among young Americans during his successful 2024 presidential campaign.On Sunday, Washington also annouced that trade deals with Malaysia and Cambodia had been secured and framworks agreed with Thailand and Vietnam.",

    "body": "1 day agoSeher AsafGetty ImagesThe Bangalore-bound bus was carrying about 40 passengers when it collided with a motorcycle on Friday A bus fire that killed at least 20 people in southern India was intensified by hundreds of smartphones being onboard, local reports say, citing forensics officials.Flames rapidly engulfed the Bangalore-bound bus after it collided with a motorcycle that ruptured its fuel tank and triggered an explosion early on Friday.Eyewitnesses said the approximately 40 passengers had struggled to escape as locals rushed to pull out survivors.Forensic experts have now told local media that the bus had been carrying a shipment of 234 mobile phones, and that the lithium-ion batteries they contained likely exacerbated the fire once they ruptured.\"The bus batteries, presence of flammable furnishings in the bus and the cargo consisting of cell phones aggravated the fire leading to the tragic event,\" CNN News18 quotes Kurnool Superintendent of Police Vikrant Patel as saying. Meanwhile, P Venkataraman, the director-general of the Andhra Pradesh Fire Services Department, said electrical batteries used for the air conditioning system of the bus also exploded and made the fire worse. \"We saw bones and ash dropping through the melted sheets,\" he told local media.The smartphones were worth 4.6m Indian rupees (£39,361; $52,377) and were being sent from Hyderabad to an e-commerce company in Bengaluru, broadcaster NDTV reports.Most smartphones have lithium-ion batteries, which can pose a fire risk when damaged.This is because they can experience thermal runaway - uncontrollable temperature increases - which is hard to stop with conventional firefighting means. It can also spread to other batteries in close proximity.Authorities have opened an investigation into possible negligent driving over the crash. The bus driver fled the scene. The motorcyclist is said to be among the dead.Buses are a common mode of transport in India, but operators frequently ignore safety rules and overcrowd vehicles, while the nation had the highest road accident death tolls in the world last year.",

    "body": "Hurricane Melissa is forecast to become a rare category five storm as it turns towards Jamaica, bringing life-threatening flash flooding and landslides.The cyclone, which had winds of up to 120 mph (195 km/h) as of 06:00 GMT, is currently turning north-west in the Caribbean and is expected to make landfall by Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).It warns of power cuts and damage to infrastructure as Melissa brings up to 30 inches (76cm) of rain and sea level surges as high as 13ft (4m) above ground. \"Seek shelter now,\" residents have been told.Melissa is the 13th hurricane in this year's Atlantic season, which typically ends in November.A category five hurricane is the strongest type, with winds of at least 157mph. While Melissa is set to weaken to a category four before reaching Jamaica, the NHC said there was \"very little practical difference in the overall impacts\" upon landfall, and that the hurricane will be \"at least that intensity\" when it hits the island.With tropical storm-strength winds and rain already expected well before it passes over central Jamaica - including potentially the capital, Kingston - it warns that \"preparations should be rushed to completion\".\"A multi-day period of damaging winds and heavy rainfall have begun and will cause catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides,\" the meteorological agency urged residents. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said: \"I know that there are many Jamaicans who are anxious, who are very concerned, and rightfully so: you should be concerned.\"But the best way to address anxiety and any nervousness and concern is to be prepared.\"Residents are being told to secure their homes with sandbags and wooden boards, and to stock up on essentials.Warnings are also in effect parts of Haiti including the capital, Port au Prince, the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba, where Melissa is anticipated to bring similar effects by the middle of next week.Landslides already being caused by the hurricane have already killed two in Haiti, the nation's Civil Protection agency has said.Melissa is forecast to pass over Cuba by Wednesday before moving through the Antillas Mayores and out into the Atlantic.By the time it reaches Cuba, it is predicted to have weakened to a category three  storm.While it is hard to link individual weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making weather phenomena more common and more severe.Warmer oceans produce more moisture in the air, helping fuel the formation of hurricanes.Ahead of the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted above-normal activity, citing warmer seas and potential stronger monsoon activity around West Africa - where Atlantic storms often form.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDamian Zane and Danai Nesta KupembaReutersHundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes because of the ongoing conflictSudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) says it has taken control of the western city of el-Fasher, marking a turning point in the civil war.The group said in a statement on social media that it had seized el-Fasher \"from the grip of mercenaries and militias allied with the terrorist army\".The loss would be a huge blow to the Sudanese army as el-Fasher is its last remaining foothold in the Darfur region, leaving the RSF effectively in control of the area. The army has yet to comment.It comes after the rebel group announced the capture of the army's 6th Division Headquarters, saying that it had destroyed \"huge military vehicles\" and taken military equipment.BBC Verify has confirmed the authenticity of videos circulating on social media that show RSF fighters inside the army base.Local pro-army fighters, the Popular Resistance, accused the RSF of running a \"media disinformation campaign\" to undermine the \"high morale of the forces\".The RSF has surrounded el-Fasher for the last 18 months, with army positions and civilians under frequent bombardment. An estimated 300,000 people have been trapped by the fighting.Medics under siege: 'We feared this photo would be our last'A simple guide to the war in SudanIn August, satellite imagery showed a series of extensive earthen walls being constructed around the city, aimed at trapping people inside.The RSF have been steadily advancing towards the 6th Infantry Division command - widely regarded as the army headquarters in the city - from several directions for weeks. There are still some parts of el-Fasher under the control of the army and allied armed groups - but those are not expected to hold out for long now. Hunger and disease has spread across the city as residents contend with constant bombardment and dwindling food and medical supplies.UN investigators have accused the RSF of committing numerous crimes against humanity during the siege. The US has said the RSF has committed genocide against Darfur's non-Arab population.Sudan has been ravished by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued. More than 150,000 people have died across the country and about 12 million have fled their homes, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises.The army controls most of the north and the east, with el-Fasher being until now the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by government forces and its allies.The RSF controls almost all of Darfur and much of the neighbouring Kordofan region.The group has previously said that it hopes to form a rival government in al-Fasher when it assumes complete control.Additional reporting by Peter MwaiMore BBC Africa stories:Inside Khartoum, a city left in ruins after two years of war'Our children are dying': Rare footage shows plight of civilians in besieged Sudan cityA pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zone: 'I prayed the baby wouldn't come'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he is adding 10% to US tariffs on goods imported from Canada, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan.Calling the advert a \"fraud\", the US president lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship.Prime Minister Mark Carney said in response that Canada was ready \"to continue to build on the progress we had been making\" in trade talks, but added that it was developing trade relationships with other countries. Canada is the only G7 country to not reach a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to levy steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Trump said while travelling to Asia on Saturday that he was \"increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now\". Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign products, not the exporters themselves.Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.Carney was asked about Trump's threatened increase at the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit that both leaders are attending, and said he was ready to continue discussions with one of the country's biggest trading partners.\"We have a consistent focus in those discussions on doing the best deal for Canadian workers and their families,\" he said.But he said the government could do more than one thing at a time, and it would in the next few weeks release an \"ambitious budget that makes generational investments in Canada\". At the same time, he said, the country was \"in the process of diversifying our trade relationships\", which included making deals with many Asean members.US-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc earlier emphasised that \"progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration\".Trump told reporters accompanying him on Air Force One that he had no intention of meeting his Canadian counterpart during the trip to Malaysia. His announcement comes after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause the anti-tariff advertising campaign \"so that trade talks can resume\", after the US cut off discussions over the advert featuring Reagan, a Republican president and conservative icon.But Ford said it would still appear through the weekend during games for the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.Trump responded that the advert should have been pulled down \"IMMEDIATELY\". A spokesperson for Ford stood by his statement on Friday.The advert, sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes Reagan as saying tariffs \"hurt every American\". It takes excerpts from his 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use the footage.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does, however, change the order in which he made the comments.Ford had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, told the BBC.The Reagan advert is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series in a social media video on Friday.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers - who are based in Newsom's state - win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"",

    "body": "​​Women welcome arrest of charity boss identified in BBC sex-for-aid investigation21 hours agoFundanur Ozturk,BBC News Turkish and Kawoon Khamoosh,BBC World ServiceBBCTurkish charity owner Sadettin Karagoz denies allegations that he sexually assaulted refugees who came to him for aidA Turkish charity owner at the centre of sexual abuse allegations, brought to light by a BBC investigation, has been arrested.BBC News Turkish revealed accusations that Sadettin Karagoz sexually exploited vulnerable women, promising them aid in return for sex. He denies all the allegations.Mr Karagoz set up his charity in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in 2014. Syrian refugees desperate for help said at first he seemed like \"an angel\".One of them, Madina, fled the Syrian civil war in 2016 and said that two years later, one of her children became critically ill and her husband abandoned her. Her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.Left to care for three children alone, she went to Sadettin Karagoz's organisation, which translates as the Hope Charity Store. It gathers donations for refugees such as nappies, pasta, milk and clothes.Mr Karagoz's organisation is based in the Altindag area of Ankara, which is home to thousands of Syrian refugees\"He told me: 'When you have nowhere to go, come to me and I will look after you,\" she says.But when she did, Madina says he changed. She describes how Mr Karagoz told her to go with him to an area in the office behind a curtain to get some supplies.\"He grabbed me,\" she says. \"He started kissing me… I told him to get away from me. If I hadn't yelled, he would have tried to rape me.\"Madina describes how she escaped from the building but Mr Karagoz later went to her home.\"I didn't open the door because I was terrified,\" she says, explaining that he threatened to have her sent back to Syria.Scared of repercussions, Madina says she never went to the police and did not tell anyone else what had happened.Mr Karagoz says his organisation has given vital supplies such as rice, milk and tinned tomato paste to refugees over the past decadeMr Karagoz, a retired bank worker, denies the allegations and has told the BBC that his organisation has helped more than 37,000 people. He says that the aid distribution area in the charity is small, crowded and monitored by CCTV so he could not have been alone with any woman.Over the years, his charity has gained widespread recognition and won a local newspaper award in 2020. It has been featured on national TV, and he says it has attracted support from national and international organisations. In March this year he changed its Turkish name to My Home-meal Association.In all, three women, including Madina, told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had sexually assaulted and harassed them. Seven other people, including two former employees of his charity, say they either witnessed or heard first-hand testimony of him committing acts of sexual abuse between 2016 and 2024.Nada says she went to Mr Karagoz because her family desperately needed supportAccording to 27-year-old Syrian refugee Nada, he said he would only give her aid if she went to an empty flat with him. \"If you don't, I won't give you anything,\" she says Mr Karagoz told her. Again, her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.She was with her sister-in-law and says they stormed out. But desperate to provide for her family, she explains she didn't know where else to turn, so went back.On one occasion, Nada says Mr Karagoz took her behind a curtain to get nappies for her son where \"he tried to touch my breasts\".Another time, she says that \"he came from behind and grabbed my hand… he forced me to touch his genitals\".Afraid of the stigma attached to sexual abuse and scared she would be blamed, Nada says she didn't feel she could tell anyone, even her husband.Batoul says an encounter with Mr Karagoz scared her and that afterwards she isolated herself at home and was afraid to open her door to anyone The third woman who told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had assaulted her is Batoul, who has since moved to Germany.A single mother, she too says she went to him for help. \"When I turned away to pick up the aid, he put his hands on my backside,\" she explains. \"I left the aid and walked out of the shop.\"These testimonies were not the first to surface against Mr Karagoz.In 2019 and 2025 he was accused of sexual harassment and assault, but on both occasions prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Police said neither victims nor witnesses were willing to come forward to make formal complaints.Some women told us they were afraid testifying could lead to them being harassed or deported.But after the BBC investigation, it is understood two other women came forward to report Mr Karagoz, and their testimony resulted in him being charged with sexual abuse. He is now in jail awaiting trial.Batoul says she is \"truly happy\" he has been arrested, \"for myself and for all the women who have suffered in silence and couldn't speak out because of fear\".She adds that she hopes it \"gives courage and strength to all women who are being exploited in any way\".Mr Karagoz says health conditions mean he is not able to engage in sexual activityBefore he was arrested, we put the allegations made by Madina, Nada, Batoul and charity workers to Mr Karagoz.He denied all the accusations and claimed if they were true, more women would have come forward.\"Three people, five people, 10 people [could complain]. Such things occur,\" he said. \"If you said 100, 200 [had accused me], then fine, then you could believe I actually did those things.\"He also said he had diabetes and high blood pressure and showed us a medical report with details of an operation in 2016 to remove his left testicle. This meant he was not able to perform any sexual activity, he said.However a professor of urology and specialist in men's sexual health, Ates Kadioglu, told the BBC that having one testicle removed \"doesn't affect someone's sex life\".We put this to Mr Karagoz who insisted that sexual activity was \"not possible for me\".We also put it to him that sexual assault may be motivated by a desire for power and control. He responded by saying: \"I personally don't have such an urge.\"\"All we did was good deeds and this is what we get in return.\"Sadettin Karagoz said women who accused him of assault in the past did so because he had reported them to the police for being involved in illegal activities.All the women we spoke to denied they or their relatives were involved with crime and the BBC has seen no evidence to suggest that they were.",

    "body": "Two arrested over theft of jewels at Louvre museum in Paris6 hours agoJake LaphamWatch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleTwo suspects have been arrested over the theft of precious crown jewels from Paris's Louvre museum, French media say.The Paris prosecutor's office said one of the men had been taken into custody as he was preparing to take a flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum last Sunday, when four thieves wielding power tools broke into the building in broad daylight.France's justice minister has conceded security protocols \"failed\", leaving the country with a \"terrible image\".The Paris prosecutor's office said in a statement that the arrests had been made on Saturday evening, without specifying how many people had been taken into custody.One of the suspects was preparing to travel to Algeria, police sources have told French media, while it is understood the other was going to Mali.Specialist police can detain and question them for up to 96 hours.According to reports in French media on Sunday, DNA found at the scene of the robbery led to the identification of one of the suspects. The gang left behind a number of items, including gloves and a high-vis jacket. It has previously been reported that they dropped a crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III.The Paris prosecutor criticised the \"premature disclosure\" of information related to the case, adding that it hindered efforts to recover the jewels and find the thieves.The thieves reportedly arrived at 09:30 (08:30 GMT), shortly after the museum opened to visitors.The suspects arrived with a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Pictures from the scene showed the ladder leading up to a first-floor window.Two of the thieves entered by cutting through the window with power tools.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the premises, and cut through the glass of two display cases containing jewels.A preliminary report has revealed that one in three rooms in the area of the museum raided had no CCTV cameras, according to French media.French police say the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38.The museum's director told French senators this week that the only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where they broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to Gallery of Apollo.CCTV around the perimeter was also weak and \"ageing\", Laurence des Cars said, meaning that staff failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumA tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen Experts have also expressed concern that the jewels may have already been broken up into hundreds of pieces.Gold and silver can be melted down and the gems can be cut up into smaller stones that will be virtually impossible to track back to the robbery, Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told the BBC. Security measures have since been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.",

    "body": "A suspect has been arrested after footage which appears to capture the alleged attempted rape of a woman on a train near Paris went viral, local media say. Jhordana Dias, a 26-year-old Brazilian national, was allegedly attacked earlier this month. She told Le Parisien newspaper that the man boarded the train, pushed her and attempted to pull down her underwear. Alerted by her screams, another passenger pulled out her phone to film. The  footage captures a man fleeing as the train pulls into a station. The incident has revived discussions around women's safety in France.According to French media, a man was arrested on Friday evening by transport police in Mantes-la-Jolie, north-west of Paris. He was traced there by investigators, but it is unclear how.He was not carrying identity documentation at the time of his arrest, but told police he was a 26-year-old Egyptian national, media reports say. He remains in custody.The alleged incident took place on 15 October between the Choisy-le-Roi and Villeneuve-le-Roi train stations, south-east of Paris.The video shows shows a man dressed in a black tracksuit and cap onboard a carriage.Over the sound of a woman's cries, the woman filming can be heard saying \"you stay there\" as the man appears to begin approaching her.The train then pulls into a station, and the man disembarks and flees down the platform.The woman who filmed the incident, named in French media only as Marguerite, has since been widely credited as having saved Ms Dias from a more serious attack.Ms Dias, who does not speak French, reportedly filed a complaint with police in Choisy-le-Roi with the help of her brother, who translated her testimony.The footage has been widely circulated on news outlets and social media. prompting many women to share their own experiences of harassment on public transport in France.Two other women have since told Le Parisian that they had been victims of the same man.",

    "body": "13 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondent, in Kuala LumpurWatch: Trump claims to have ended another war. Will it last?It was, as everyone knew it would be, all about US President Donald Trump.He literally towered over everyone else at the ceremony in Kuala Lumpur where Cambodia and Thailand signed their agreement. He gave the longest speech - and made the biggest claims.It was all superlatives. \"This is a momentous day for South East Asia,\" Trump said. \"A monumental step.\" Describing the two slightly sheepish-looking prime ministers who were about to sign the deal as \"historic figures\", Trump recalled at length how he got involved in the Thai-Cambodian border conflict while he was visiting his Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July.\"And I said this is much more important than a round of golf... I could have had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun... saving people and saving countries.\"Trump had asked for this special ceremony as a condition for coming to the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit - a gathering US presidents have attended at times in the past, but not always. And he used it to press his campaign to be recognised as a great peacemaker. \"The eight wars that my administration has ended in eight months – there's never been anything like that,\" he said. \"We're averaging one a month... It's like, I shouldn't say it's a hobby, because it's so much more serious, but something I'm good at and something I love to do.\"But what does the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord\", as Trump has renamed it, actually amount to?Remember, both countries signed a ceasefire back in July. That, too, was helped - or at least accelerated - by pressure from Trump. Looking at the details of the latest deal, though, it isn't much of leap forward.The two countries have agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed border and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it. They have a new procedure for clearing landmines, and will set up what they call a joint taskforce to address the proliferation of scam centres. They will replace missing border markers with temporary ones.This is progress - and Thai diplomats have told me they do feel Trump's involvement may help these agreements stick. But the historic differences over the border remain unresolved and are at risk of flaring up again.After the ceremony, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow refused to call it a peace agreement - sticking instead to their own preferred title \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\", which doesn't exactly trip off the tongue.\"I would call it a pathway to peace,\" was as far as Sihasak was willing to go - a far cry from Trump's expansive claims for it.\"It's an extremely slight agreement for the president of the United States to be presiding over,\" posted Sebastian Strangio, author and South East Asia Editor for the Diplomat magazine.Cambodia has been a lot more enthusiastic, but then it has always sought to internationalise its dispute with Thailand - referring it to the International Court of Justice - something Thailand does not agree with. At the ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet gushed with praise for the US president - reminding him that his government had nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charvirakul was more circumspect - mindful of nationalist pressure back home not to be giving too much away to Cambodia, a problem the authoritarian government in Cambodia does not have to worry about. Thailand has always insisted the dispute should be resolved bilaterally, with no outside mediation. It says it appreciates Trump's support, and describes the US and Malaysia as only \"facilitating\" this agreement.Neither country - nor the rest of Asean - could afford to spurn Trump's request for this ceremony. South East Asia is the most export-dependant region in the world, far more reliant on the US market than China. It has had a difficult year living under the existential threat posed by Trump's initial tariffs - up to 48% - and going through the nail-biting negotiations to bring them down to a more manageable 19-20%. Trump is not even staying for most of the Asean summit. After a couple of bilateral meetings and a dinner, he's off to Japan, and then to an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting - another multilateral grouping at odds with his brutally transactional style, but where he hopes to reset relations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.But just having had the US president here in Kuala Lumpur for 24 hours will, Asean hopes, help restore some stability to their relationship.",

    "body": "Trump hopes China will help push Russia towards Ukraine peace talks1 day agoTiffany WertheimerReutersTrump and Xi last met in person in 2019, during Trump's first term as presidentDonald Trump has said he would like China's help to deal with Russia as he seeks to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like China to help us out with Russia,\" the US president said on board Air Force One, as he flew to Asia for a whirlwind tour, where he will meet China's Xi Jinping in South Korea.It could be wishful thinking, however. China is Russia's biggest ally, and a vital support to Moscow since Western sanctions were imposed over its war in Ukraine.Trump's comments come off the back of a difficult week for Kyiv - the US refused to give it Tomahawk cruise missiles, EU leaders did not release frozen Russian cash to help fund its defence, and there have been more deadly strikes.Ending the Russia-Ukraine war has become a focal point for Trump in recent months, with a ceasefire deal so far eluding him, despite his campaign promises to solve the situation quickly. A summit with Putin in August failed to yield any tangible results, and Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Moscow.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere,\" Trump said earlier this week.On Wednesday, he announced new sanctions against Russia's two biggest oil companies - the first direct interventions the Trump administration has imposed on Russia over the war. What effect the blacklisting will have in the long-term is yet to be seen, but the Kremlin said it was \"immune\" to the sanctions.What's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?While Trump's meeting with Xi on Thursday is still expected to focus on the hostile trade relations between the US and China, Trump said that he would talk to Xi about \"everything\", including the war in Ukraine.\"I'd like to see China help us out [with Russia]. I have a very good relationship... with President Xi. Very good,\" he said, adding that Xi wants to see the war end.Earlier this week, Trump said that the Chinese president \"can have a big influence on Putin\".SPUTNIK/KREMLIN POOL/EPA/ShutterstockPutin, Xi and Kim showed their solidarity when the three met in Beijing last monthBeijing has never criticised Russia's war in Ukraine, and has been accused by the US and its allies of aiding Russia's war effort - which Beijing denies - through its purchases of Russian oil and monthly supply of dual-use materials (those with both commercial and military applications).Putin and Xi have previously touted their countries' relationship as a \"friendship with no limits\", and Russia hopes gas exports to China and other countries will replace the revenue lost after Western sanctions were imposed.Xi, Putin and Kim show united front at huge Chinese military paradeRussia's Putin hails 'unprecedented' ties with China at talks in BeijingThe warm relations between Russia and China were on full display last month, when Putin, Xi and North Korea's Kim Jong Un met in Beijing for an extraordinary show of solidarity and military might.EPA/ShutterstockRussian strikes on Kyiv left killed several people and caused huge damage on SaturdayAs Trump made his comments on Air Force One, emergency crews in Ukraine were at the scene of more Russian strikes, including some in Kyiv where several people were killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\"No country should be left alone in the face of such evil,\" he wrote on Telegram, reiterating the need for Ukraine's allies to step-up support.Meanwhile, in Russia's Belgorod region, residents living near a dam were told to evacuate after a Ukrainian strike on the local reservoir caused damage that could lead to flooding.More on this story",

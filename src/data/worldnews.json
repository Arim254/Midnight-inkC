    "body": "A diamond-studded locket swallowed by a New Zealand man who tried to steal it has been \"recovered\", police say.The Fabergé egg locket, valued at NZ$33,585 ($19,300; £14,600), was recovered in a \"natural\" manner. \"Medical intervention [was] not required,\" they told the BBC.This comes about a week after police arrested the 32-year-old man at Patridge Jewellers in central Auckland, minutes after he allegedly ate the locket.The ingested loot is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, according to the jeweller's website, and opens to reveal an 18-carat gold miniature octopus.The man has been charged with theft.Earlier this week, New Zealand police said the man had undergone a medical assessment and is constantly being monitored.\"Given this man is in police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred,\" police said then.The Octopussy egg, as it is named, was inspired by the 1983 James Bond film of the same name, which centres on an elaborate Fabergé egg heist.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.Partridge Jewellers said the locket will be returned to Fabergé, Radio NZ reported.The suspect is due to appear in court again on 8 December.According to charge sheets seen by the BBC, he has also been charged with allegedly stealing an iPad from the same jewellery store on 12 November and making away with cat litter and flea control products worth NZ$100 from a private address a day after.",

    "body": "The man accused of assassinating former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has apologised to the ex-leader's family for the first time.Tetsuya Yamagami, who earlier pleaded guilty to murder, told the court on Thursday that he felt \"deeply sorry\" towards Abe's widow, Akie.Yamagami used a homemade gun to shoot Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022. He died in the hospital on the same day.Abe's death sent shockwaves around the world. He was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as \"Abenomics\".\"I have caused [the family] three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse,\" Yamagami told the court on Thursday, according to local media.He reportedly told investigators he attacked Abe because he blamed the ex-prime minister for allegedly promoting the Unification Church, which Yamagami said had bankrupted his mother and the wider family.Yamagami's allegations prompted investigations into the Unification Church, which started in South Korea and is known for its mass weddings.In March this year, a Tokyo court ordered the church to disband - a ruling that the church said it would \"fight to the end\".The Unification Church has drawn controversy even before Abe's assassination, for teaching that marriage is central to spiritual salvation.Abe's grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was also Japan's prime minister, was known to have been close to the Unification Church because of its anti-communist nature. Abe himself had spoken at events related to the group.During a hearing last month, prosecutors read out a statement from Abe's widow in which she wrote: \"The sorrow of losing a husband will not be relieved.\"",

It said it was believed to be the first time the agency has issued a completely false earthquake notification.An investigation is under way to determine what caused the malfunction.Multiple law enforcement agencies in cities and counties near the reported epicentre confirmed the absence of any ground movement.A magnitude 5.9 earthquake is typically strong enough to cause noticeable shaking and slight property damage, according to the Michigan Tech Earthquake Magnitude Scale.",

    "body": "The Israeli military has carried out a new round of air strikes in southern Lebanon, less than a day after Israel and Lebanon held their first direct talks in decades.Residents of the towns of Mjadel, Baraachit, Jbaa and Mahrouna were told to evacuate areas around locations that the Israeli military alleged were weapons warehouses belonging to the Iranian-backed group. No casualties have been reported.An Israeli military spokesman said the sites constituted a ceasefire violation and warned that it would continue to operate \"to remove any threat\" to Israel. Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon since a ceasefire took effect in November 2024, following 13 months of conflict.There was no immediate comment from Lebanon's leaders in response to Thursday's strikes. Lebanese politicians have previously condemned similar strikes as ceasefire violations.Under the first phase of a deal brokered by the US and France, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah was to remove its fighters and weapons from south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel - a plan the group and its allies oppose.Israel has maintained positions at several strategic border sites and stepped up its air strikes in recent weeks. It is an escalation officials say is driven by Hezbollah's attempts to rebuild its military infrastructure and what they see as limited Lebanese government efforts to disarm the group.Thursday's strikes came less than 24 hours after Israel and Lebanon sent civilian envoys to the Lebanese border town of Naqoura for their first direct talks in decades.The talks, hosted at the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission, Unifil, took place during a meeting of the ceasefire monitoring committee, which until now had only included military officers from the US, France, Lebanon, Israel and Unifil.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying the meeting \"took place in a good atmosphere\" and that it \"was agreed that ideas would be formulated to advance possible economic cooperation between Israel and Lebanon\".It also said that Israeli envoys \"clarified that the disarmament of Hezbollah is obligatory, regardless of the advancement of economic co-operation\".Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam was more cautious, saying Lebanon remained \"far\" from diplomatic normalisation with Israel and that the talks were focused on \"defusing tension\".\"We are not yet at peace talks,\" he told reporters, saying Lebanon's priorities were the cessation of hostilities, the release of Lebanese detainees held by Israel, and Israel's full withdrawal from its territory.He added that Beirut was open to the deployment of French and US troops to help verify efforts to disarm Hezbollah.The latest strikes and diplomatic moves coincide with a visit by a UN Security Council delegation to Lebanon to review the stalled implementation of the ceasefire.",

    "body": "South Korean authorities are developing a mobile app for stalking victims to track in real-time the location of their stalkers, if they're nearby.The app, announced by South Korea's justice ministry on Wednesday, is part of an approved amendment to the country's electronic monitoring law.Stalkers have become a subject of public concern in South Korea, especially as high-profile crimes involving stalking have made headlines in recent years.Under the current law, stalking victims can receive text message alerts when their stalkers are nearby - though these do not reveal stalkers' exact locations.This makes it difficult for victims to determine the direction of the perpetrator, the justice ministry said in a statement.Under the revised law, victims will be allowed to see their stalker's location on a map with their smartphones, allowing them to evacuate to safety.Authorities track stalkers' whereabouts using wearable electronic devices.The justice ministry said it was also working on integrating the tracking system into the national emergency hotline, so police could be deployed to protect victims as needed.This integration is expected to be completed next year, local media reported.Critics have voiced concern over the pervasiveness of stalking in South Korea, which they see as part of a wider problem of violence against women - many of whom have been secretly filmed by spy cameras and faced hostile threats for being feminists.In 2022, public anger erupted over the murder of a young woman by her male ex-colleague, who had been stalking her for years. Although she had reported him to the police, he was not detained or given a restraining order as authorities viewed him as \"low risk\".In 2021, South Korea introduced an anti-stalking law that carries up to three years of jail for offenders and a maximum fine of 30 million Korean won ($20,400; £15,300).In 2023, South Korea's parliament revised the law to lower the barrier to prosecuting stalkers.The number of reports against stalkers have surged since then, from 7,600 in 2022 to more than 13,000 last year, according to data from the justice ministry.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAdrienne MurrayCopenhagenThe parliament of the Faroe Islands voted on Thursday to legalise abortion until the end of the 12th week of pregnancy, overturning a decades-old law that prohibited abortions in most cases.Previous legislation allowed abortions only in certain circumstances - such as rape, incest or risk to the health of the pregnant woman - and meant the self-governing Danish territory had among the most restrictive abortion policies in Europe. Following a heated parliamentary debate, the decision came down to the wire, with MPs narrowly voting in favour of the reform, by 17 to 16.\"This is truly an historic day in the Faroe Islands,\" said Ingilín Didriksen Strømm, one of the four MPs who tabled the bill.Strømm told the BBC: \"This change finally affirms women's autonomy over their own bodies in the Faroe Islands.\"\"It guarantees access to safe healthcare, and it also protects our freedom to make decisions about our own lives without fear, without stigma and without criminalisation,\" she added.The new legislation in the Faroe Islands - located between Scotland and Norway - is expected to come into effect on 1 July next year, replacing laws dating back to 1956.Under that legislation, abortions could only be performed in special circumstances - which also included if there are severe fetal health problems or if the woman is deemed \"unfit\" to care for the child.Whether a woman is \"unfit\" or not is judged first by a GP, and then a second medical body, before an abortion is granted. Both the woman and the doctor risked imprisonment if the conditions were not met.Faroese pro-choice campaigners have argued the legislation was outdated and impinged on women's rights.\"This is a colossal change,\" Bjørt Lind from pro-choice campaign group Fritt Val told Danish newspaper Politiken.\"Abortion has been so hidden and taboo in Faroese society. When we started our work, no one dared to talk about it. It has gotten much better,\" she says. \"But it's still a huge challenge.\"In a statement to the BBC, Amnesty International's Faroe Islands branch said: \"After years of campaigning we finally have a law respecting women's and all pregnant people's rights to a safe and legal abortion until week 12.\"\"This is a huge step for human rights, the right to bodily autonomy and to secure safe abortions,\"  it added. \"And Faroese women don't have to go on an expensive trip abroad to have an abortion.\"With limited access to abortions in the Faroe Islands, campaign groups said women often had to travel to Denmark for the procedure.Danish law has allowed abortion up to 12 weeks since 1973, and in June this year, that was amended to extend terminations on request until 18 weeks.According to the Centre for Reproductive Rights, some 43 countries in Europe allow \"abortion on request\" during the early stages of pregnancy. Only five - Andorra, Malta, Liechtenstein, Poland and Monaco - maintain highly restrictive laws.Those opposed to the law change in the Faroe Islands, argued that the right of the fetus should be protected. Erhard Joensen, an MP who voted against Thursday's bill, told Danish national broadcaster, DR, that he respects the result, but does not believe there is much support for the new law. \"I think we will see that some will try to roll it back,\" he said.The remote archipelago is home to around 56,000 people, who speak Faroese and have a distinct cultural identity. Compared to other Nordic countries, society in the Faroe Islands is considered relatively conservative, with more than three quarters of the population members of the Lutheran church.Previous attempts to liberalise abortion laws have failed. Most recently, in May last year, an almost identical bill resulted in a tied vote, failing to secure the majority required to pass the Faroese parliament.",

    "body": "11 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "A prominent Palestinian militia leader in Gaza who opposed Hamas has been killed.Yasser Abu Shabab headed the so-called Popular Forces group, which has dozens of fighters and operates in Israeli-controlled territory near the southern city of Rafah.The Popular Forces said in a statement that Abu Shabab was shot while \"attempting to resolve a dispute\" between members of the Abu Seneima family. It dismissed as \"misleading\" reports that he was killed by Hamas, which had accused him of collaborating with Israel.An earlier statement from Abu Shabab's Bedouin tribe, the Tarabin, said he had been killed \"at the hands of the resistance\", and accused him of betraying the Palestinian people.Other sources said his death was the result of an internal power struggle.A Hamas statement said the \"fate that befell\" Abu Shabab was \"the inevitable fate of all who betray their people and homeland and are content to be tools in the hands of the occupation [Israel]\", without claiming involvement in his killing.Israel's Army Radio cited a security source as saying that Abu Shabab had died of his wounds after being evacuated to Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. But the hospital denied that he died under their care.The statement from the Popular Forces pledged to continue on Abu Shabab's \"path until the last terrorist is eliminated from the soil of Gaza and a bright and secure future is built for our people, who believe in peace\".In June, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming Palestinian clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas.It came after Israeli media reported that he had authorised the supply of weapons to the Popular Forces. However, the militia denied that it was being armed by Israel.The Popular Forces have been accused of looting humanitarian aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, which the militia has also denied. Reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began almost eight weeks ago, Abu Shabab had reportedly been one of several anti-Hamas militia leaders jostling for position in the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.It would involve setting up an interim government, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.Under the first phase, Hamas agreed to return all 48 living and dead hostages it was still holding in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, as well as a partial Israeli withdrawal and a surge in humanitarian aid.The body of one dead Israeli hostage is yet to be returned.Israel's government has previously said it would not join talks on the second phase until Hamas has returned all the hostages. However, Trump said on Wednesday that the second phase was \"going to happen pretty soon\".The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,120 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has warned again that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war in Ukraine.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he told India Today. Moscow controls some 85% of Donbas.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory.Putin's comments come after Donald Trump said his negotiators discussing a US peace plan believed Russia's leader \"would like to end the war\" after Tuesday's talks in Moscow.Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who was in Moscow, was due to meet Ukraine's team in Florida.Trump said Tuesday's talks in the Kremlin were \"reasonably good\", adding it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".The Kremlin said on Friday that Moscow was awaiting a response from Washington following the meeting in Russia.\"We are now waiting for the reaction of our American colleagues to the discussion we had on Tuesday,\" Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov was quoted as saying by RIA.He added there were no plans for a call between Putin and Trump, and no date had been set for a new meeting with Witkoff.The original iteration of the US peace plan proposed to hand over areas of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Putin - but the Witkoff team presented a modified version in Moscow.In his India Today interview ahead of a state visit to Delhi, Putin said he had not seen the new version before his talks with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.\"That's why we had to go over every point, that's why it took so long,\" the Kremlin leader said.He also said Moscow disagreed with parts of the US plan.\"At times we said that yes, we can discuss this, but to that we can't agree,\" Putin said.He did not name the sticking points. At least two significant points of contention remain - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Putin's senior foreign policy adviser and key negotiator Yuri Ushakov earlier said straight after the talks that they produced \"no compromise\" on ending the war.Ushakov also implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to what Moscow said were its recent successes on the battlefield.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stalling any ceasefire agreements, saying Moscow is seeking to seize more Ukrainian territory.Commenting on the Kremlin talks, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia said  Putin was \"wasting the world's time\".Ukraine has long insisted on firm security guarantees for Ukraine in any deal.On Wednesday, Zelensky said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\" - but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\", which Kyiv and its European allies accuse of deliberately stalling any ceasefire agreements.The Ukrainian president said last week his top negotiators had managed to make some key changes in the original US peace plan - seen as strongly favouring Moscow - during talks with an American delegation in Geneva on 23 November.In a joint statement, US and Ukrainian negotiators said at the time that they had drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" - but provided no further details.Top negotiators from Europe - who had voiced concern over the original US plan - were also in the Swiss city last week, meeting separately with the Ukrainian and the US teams.In a separate development on Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel news website said it had obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call in which European leaders expressed concern over the US negotiations.\"There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees,\" French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said, according to an English transcript of Monday's conference call.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was quoted as warning that Zelensky had to be \"extremely careful in the coming days\".\"They are playing games, both with you and with us,\" Merz reportedly said.Finnish President Alexander Stubb was also quoted as saying: \"We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys.\"The BBC has not seen the reported transcript. In response to a Der Spiegel inquiry, France's Élysée Palace stated that \"the president did not express himself in those terms\". The presidential office declined to provide details on how Macron expressed himself, citing confidentiality.Stubb declined to comment to Der Spiegel, and Merz has not commented on the issue.In a statement to the BBC, the White House said: \"Secretary [Marco] Rubio, Special Envoy Witkoff, Mr Kushner, and the President's entire national security team are working tirelessly to stop the killing between Russia and Ukraine.\"\"They have held productive meetings to gather feedback from both sides on a plan that can foster a durable, enforceable peace,\" the statement read.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In recent weeks, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in south-east Ukraine, despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

That's where most of the animals live. So obviously, if you're removing the sediment, you're removing the animals in it too,\" lead author Eva Stewart, PhD student at the Natural History Museum and the University of Southampton, told BBC News.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgThe scientists catalogued all the animals they found in the sediment, including this worm\"Even if they are not killed by the machine, pollution from the mining operations could slowly kill some less resilient species,\" said Dr Guadalupe Bribiesca-Contreras from the National Oceanography Centre.A few of the animals could have moved away, but \"whether or not they come back after disturbance is a different question\", she added.However, in the areas near the vehicle tracks, where clouds of sediment landed, the abundance of animals did not decrease.\"We were expecting possibly a bit more impact, but [we didn't] see much, just a shift in which species were dominant over others,\" Dr Adrian Glover, research scientist at the Natural History Museum, told BBC News.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgAn abyssal sea spider was another of macrofauna found during the research\"​We're ​encouraged ​by these ​data,\" a spokesperson for The Metals Company told BBC News.\"After ​years ​of ​activist ​alarm ​that ​our ​impacts ​would ​spread ​thousands ​of ​kilometers ​beyond ​the ​mine ​site, ​the ​data ​show ​that ​any ​biodiversity ​impacts ​are ​limited ​to ​the ​directly ​mined ​area,\" they added. But some experts do not think that this is good news for mining companies.\"I think the study shows that current technologies for harvesting are too damaging to permit large-scale commercial exploration,\" Dr Patrick Schröder, senior research fellow at the Environment and Society Centre at think tank Chatham House, told BBC News.\"These were only tests and the impact was significant. If they did that at large scale, it would be even more damaging,\" he added.Deep sea mining is controversial. At the heart of the debate is a difficult problem.The latest research took place in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a 6m sq km area of the Pacific Ocean estimated to hold over 21bn tonnes of nickel, cobalt and copper-rich polymetallic nodules.The world needs these critical minerals for renewable energy technologies to tackle climate change. They are essential components in solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles, for example.The International Energy Agency predicts that demand for the minerals could at least double by 2040.The minerals have to come from somewhere, but some scientists and environmental groups are gravely concerned that mining the deep seas could cause untold damage.Natural History Museum/University of GothenburgAn abyssal sea star was also found during the researchSome fear that before we have the chance to explore the full nature of life in the undiscovered deep ocean, it could be endangered. Oceans play a critical role in regulating our planet and are already at severe risk from rising temperatures.The International Seabed Authority (ISA), which governs activity in international waters, has not yet approved commercial mining although it has issued 31 licences for exploration.A total of 37 countries, including the UK and France, are backing a temporary ban on mining.This week Norway postponed mining plans in its waters including the Arctic.But in April, US President Donald Trump called for domestic and international projects to be fast-tracked, as the US wants to secure the supply of minerals for use in weapons.If the ISA concludes that current mining techniques are too destructive, companies could try to develop less intrusive ways of extracting nodules from the seafloor.The research is published in the scientific journal Nature ​Ecology ​and ​Evolution.",

    "body": "Suspect arrested in pipe bomb incident on eve of 2021 Capitol riot8 hours agoNadine YousifBBC NewsWatch: FBI releases new video in hunt for 6 January pipe bomb suspectA Virginia man has been arrested in connection with two pipe bombs placed outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees on the eve of the 2021 Capitol riot.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Brian Cole Jr, 30, was arrested without incident early on Thursday morning. He is charged with use of an explosive device and attempted malicious destruction by means of explosive materials. Officials did not specify a possible motive for the planting of the pipe bombs, which were safely deactivated without exploding.It caps an exhaustive investigation in a case where an arrest had eluded law enforcement despite a $500,000 (£375,000) reward. The FBI did not receive new information or a tip that cracked the case, officials said. Both bombs were placed on the night of 5 January 2021 and were only discovered the following afternoon as supporters of Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol in the last days of his first presidency. Kamala Harris, who was the US vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the Democratic National Committee headquarters shortly after the devices were found.According to court documents, the suspect lives with his parents in Woodbridge, a suburb about 20 miles (32km) outside Washington.He works for a bail bond company - such firms help people get out of jail by posting bail on their behalf in exchange for a non-refundable fee.US Department of JusticeInvestigators sifted through a mountain of evidence gathered over the years, including some three million lines of data.Mr Cole allegedly bought multiple bomb-making components in 2019 and 2020, according to the court filing.He purchased metal end caps, wires and steel wool at Home Depot and Lowes hardware stores, batteries at another retailer and timers at a Walmart in northern Virginia, an FBI affidavit states.Investigators found mobile phone data that showed Mr Cole was near the locations of the pipe bombs when they were planted between 19:39 and 20:24 local time on 5 January 2021.Watch: Aerial video shows FBI at pipe bomb suspect's homeHis car - a 2017 Nissan Sentra with a Virginia licence plate - was also seen by a licence plate reader less than half a mile (0.8km) from the location where the individual who placed the devices was first observed in the area.US Attorney Jeanine Pirro told a news conference on Thursday that the Trump administration had made solving the case a priority.\"It was like finding a needle in a haystack,\" she said.Investigators said both pipe bombs were manufactured using end caps, with Pirro adding there were 233,000 black-end caps of the type used in the plot. \"I want you to think about the act that the FBI had to go through the sale of every one of them,\" she added.The suspect's shoes were believed to be Nike Air Max Speed Turfs.The FBI discovered thousands of pairs of the shoes had been distributed through more than two dozen retailers.Watch: Attorney General Pam Bondi announces charges against pipe bomb suspectFBI officials praised the perseverance of agents and said they never gave up on finding a suspect. \"We continued to churn through massive amounts of data\", said Darren Cox, deputy assistant director of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division.Earlier this year, the FBI released CCTV footage of an individual with a backpack and light grey hooded sweater placing something near a bench outside the DNC building in Washington. The person was shown later walking to place the second bomb.FBI Director Kash Patel told the news conference that \"when you attack American citizens, when you attack our nation's capital, you attack the very being of our way of life\".\"We will provide the safest country the nation has ever seen,\" he added.FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the case showed people are not able to \"walk into our capital city\", plant devices and \"walk off into the sunset\", adding that US law enforcement will \"track you down to the end of the earth\".The pipe bomb plot spawned countless conspiracy theories, including that US law enforcement might have been involved.Before he took the job of FBI deputy director, Bongino floated the possibility last year that it was an \"inside job\" and a \"massive cover-up.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentEPAIreland, Spain, the Netherlands and Slovenia will boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, after it was decided Israel could compete. They were among a number of countries who had called for Israel to be excluded over the war in Gaza and accusations of unfair voting practices.But at a meeting in Geneva where a vote was held on new safeguards, a \"large majority\" of members agreed there was no need for a further vote on participation and that Eurovision 2026 could proceed as planned, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said.Spanish broadcaster RTVE, which had led calls for a secret ballot on the issue, said the decision had increased its \"distrust of the festival's organisation\".Ireland's RTÉ said it felt that its \"participation remains unconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there which continues to put the lives of so many civilians at risk.\"Watch: Which countries are boycotting Eurovision and why?Spain is one of Eurovision's \"Big Five\" countries along with France, Germany, Italy and the UK. Their artists are allowed straight into the final, as their broadcasters provide the largest financial contribution to the EBU. Approximately 50 broadcasters, including the BBC, attended an EBU meeting on Thursday to discuss the future of the contest, which is watched by more than 150 million people each year.They were asked to back new rules intended to discourage governments and third parties from organising voting campaigns for their acts, after allegations that Israel unfairly boosted its entrant, Yuval Raphael, this year.BBC News understands that voting to accept those measures was tied to a clause whereby members agreed not to proceed with a vote on Israel's participation.\"This vote means that all EBU Members who wish to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 and agree to comply with the new rules are eligible to take part,\" the EBU said.ReutersSinger Yuval Raphael, who survived the 7 October Hamas attack in 2023, represented Israel at this year's EurovisionGetty ImagesAustrian singer JJ won May's contest in Basel, Switzerland, toppling Israel from pole position at the last minuteMartin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said he was \"pleased\" that members had been given an \"opportunity to debate\" Israel's place in the contest before the vote. \"It was a full, frank and honest and quite moving debate, but as we can see from the emphatic result, they really came together on a belief that the Eurovision Song Contest shouldn't be used as a political theatre, it must retain some sense of neutrality.\"Israel's President Isaac Herzog praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it \"an appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation, symbolising a victory over those who seek to silence Israel and spread hatred\".He said he was \"glad that Israel will participate again in Eurovision and I hope that the competition will remain one that sanctifies culture, poetry, and friendship between peoples and cross-border cultural understanding\". He added that Israel \"deserves to be represented on every stage in the world, and I am fully and actively committed to that\".The CEO of Israel's broadcaster, KAN, said the attempt to disqualify its entry \"can only be understood as a cultural boycott.\"A boycott may begin today - with Israel - but no-one knows where it will end or who else it may harm,\" said Golan Yochpaz. \"Is this what we truly want this contest to be remembered for on its 70th anniversary?\"The BBC, which broadcasts Eurovision in the UK, said in a statement: \"We support the collective decision made by members of the EBU. This is about enforcing the rules of the EBU and being inclusive.\"Getty ImagesSpanish singer Melody representing Spain in May's contest, with the song Esa divaHowever, the decision has exposed a deep rift in the Eurovision community. In a statement, Dutch broadcaster Avrotros said that \"participation under the current circumstances is incompatible with the public values ​​that are essential to us\".Spanish broadcaster RTVE added: \"The board of directors of RTVE agreed last September that Spain would withdraw from Eurovision if Israel was part of it.\"\"This withdrawal also means that RTVE will not broadcast the Eurovision 2026 final... nor the preliminary semi-finals.\"Slovenia's broadcaster RTV added that their position also \"remains unchanged\". \"The recent rule changes do not alter our view. As a public service broadcaster, RTV Slovenia is committed to upholding ethical principles and expects that equal rules and standards apply to all EBU members and all participating countries.\"Belgium's broadcaster said it would \"take a position in the coming days\".Those who approved of the changes included Nordic broadcasters from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland who issued a joint statement saying they \"supported\" the EBU's decision to \"address critical shortcomings\" in the voting system.Despite that, Iceland's RÚV said it would not make a final decision on its participation until next week. Germany, which had threatened to leave the contest if Israel was removed, also welcomed Thursday's decision.Its broadcaster ARD said it was \"looking forward to participating\" next year, \"embracing it as a celebration of cultural diversity and solidarity\". It added: \"At the same time, we deeply regret the decisions of individual EBU members to withdraw from the ESC 2026 but, of course, respect the choices made by the respective broadcasters.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoAlfred Lasteck,BBC Africa, Dar es SalaamandBasillioh RukangaMange Kimambi/InstagramProminent Tanzanian activist Mange Kimambi has accused the government of instigating the removal of her social media accounts that she has been using to mobilise Tanzanians against the government.The former fashion model-turned-activist, who is based in the US, is an outspoken critic of President Samia Suluhu Hassan and had nearly three million followers on Instagram.She has been accused of inciting the recent deadly election protests, sparking calls for her arrest.A Meta spokesperson told the BBC that her Instagram accounts had been \"removed for violating our recidivism policy\". Tanzania government spokesman Gerson Msigwa told the BBC that she should \"provide proof of her claims\".\"We don't allow people to create new accounts that are similar to those we've previously removed for violating our Community Standards,\" said Meta, the parent company of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. In what is believed to be a reference to Kimambi last month, Tanzania's Attorney-General Hamza Johari said it was \"impossible\" how \"one person outside the country\" was directing people through social media.\"[She is] just telling people to do such things [protest] and they actually go and do it and she starts boasting... We must arrest her,\" he said.Widespread protests followed the disputed 29 October elections, which Samia won with about 98% after her key opponents were unable to contest the poll – Tundu Lissu is detained on treason charges, while Luhaga Mpina was barred on technical groundsThe opposition and rights groups believe hundreds of people were killed in the crackdown by security officers in the aftermath. The government has not released any casualty figures.Despite widespread international condemnation, Samia has since defended the use of force as \"necessary\" against protesters who \"were ready to overthrow the government\". On Monday, Samia said her government was ready to confront protesters in the fresh protests planned for Tuesday next week.Kimambi noted that on the same day her accounts were removed, those of another prominent Tanzanian activist, Maria Sarungi, were restricted.\"I believe this provides further evidence that Meta may have been pressured by the Tanzanian government to silence voices speaking out for the people,\" she wrote on her X account, which is still available.She also asked US President Donald Trump to urge Meta to reinstate her pages.\"For months, I used my platforms to highlight these issues and consistently encouraged PEACEFUL protests, as many Tanzanians feel there is no safe alternative for expressing dissent,\" she said.The removal of Kimambi's accounts come as the US says it is reviewing its relationship with Tanzania, citing growing concerns over democratic backsliding and human rights.In a statement issued on Thursday by the Department of State, Washington accuses the Tanzanian government of repressing religious freedom and free speech, blocking US investment, and failing to prevent violence before and after the 29 October elections.It says these actions have put American citizens, tourists, and US interests at risk and threaten decades of security and development cooperation.\"The future of our bilateral relationship will be based on the government's actions,\"  says the statement.The Tanzanian authorities have not yet responded.Popularly known as dada wa taifa (sister of the nation), Kimambi built her influence primarily through her social media platforms and began her campaign against the Tanzanian government during the presidency of the late John Magufuli in 2016.Two years later, she unsuccessfully attempted to mobilise nationwide protests against his government.In 2021, she publicly switched her stance and backed Samia when she took office after Magufuli's death, even though they are both from the CCM party that has governed Tanzania since independence. Kimambi even attended Samia's first official visit to the US, where the two were photographed together.However, that relationship later deteriorated, and Kimambi now uses the same platform to sharply criticise President Samia and her administration.Her critics dismiss her political activism and accuse her of using offensive language when criticising the president and other top government officials.AFP via Getty ImagesHundreds of people were reportedly killed during protests over the 29 October electionKimambi already faces charges of economic sabotage, which came up in court in Dar es Salaam on Thursday. The case was postponed to 28 January, with state prosecutors saying the matter was still under investigation.She faces one count of money laundering in the case involving over $56,000 (£42,000) alleged to be proceeds of crime obtained about three years ago.It is alleged that she acquired the money by working as a journalist without accreditation, and obtained payment through intimidation. The case was initially filed on 28 August, alleging that she had obtained the money in 2022.In a post on her Instagram page before it became unavailable, she dismissed the case as \"cooked\", adding that it \"won't change her views about the president\".She said the case was linked to her account with a Tanzanian bank that held $40,000. She claimed her last transaction in the account was in 2023 and that it was frozen last year.  The government has not responded to the accusations that the charges are politically motivated and previously told the BBC to refer to the court case.In many of her recent posts on Instagram, Kimambi has called on Tanzanians to resist the administration and turn up for protests, including the one planned for 9 December. She also shared images of the aftermath of the election protests.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

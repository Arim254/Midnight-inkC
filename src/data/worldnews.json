    "body": "Hamas ruled Gaza with an iron rod - will it really give up control?2 days agoPaul Adams,Diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem and Rushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondentBBCHow does a group that has governed the Gaza Strip for almost 20 years, ruling two million Palestinians with an iron rod and fighting Israel in repeated wars, suddenly lay down its arms and relinquish control?Judging by a steady stream of gruesome images emerging from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, Hamas seems intent on reasserting its authority.Its masked men, back on the streets, have been seen beating and executing opponents. Impromptu firing squads have dispatched kneeling men they say are members of rival groups, including some of Gaza's powerful clans.Other victims, cowering in terror, are shot in the legs or beaten with heavy clubs.Some of those now being attacked by Hamas had been part of groups involved in looting and diverting aid, according to one aid worker I spoke to, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The UN has also accused criminal gangs of stealing aid.This is not yet a world in which, as US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan envisages, Hamas fighters turn over their weapons, submit to an amnesty, leave Gaza and hand over to an international stabilisation force.AFP via Getty ImagesThe ceasefire came into effect on Friday 10 October​ - Hamas and Israel have both blamed each other for blatant violations of itFor his part, President Trump initially seemed ambivalent about the brutality.On his way to Israel on 13 October, he signalled the US had given Hamas - designated a terrorist group by the US, UK, Israel and others - a green light to restore order.\"We have given them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.Three days later, he hardened his tone. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"So, where does this situation on the ground in Gaza today leave Hamas? And ultimately, after two years of war that has resulted in unparalleled suffering for its own people and the violent death of most of its key figures, what, if anything, does the future really hold for the group?'A complete loss of law and order'For many Gazans, traumatised and exhausted by two years of perpetual suffering - and a war that has killed 68,000 people in Gaza according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry - this ugly endgame is nerve-wracking, but doesn't come as a surprise.Of the Gazans I spoke to - among them, aid workers, lawyers, as well as a former adviser to a Hamas leader - each has a different take on the likelihood of Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing control. And indeed - given the situation on the ground - whether now is the time for them to do so.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians gathered to celebrate following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement \"It's been two years with a complete loss of law and order,\" aid worker Hanya Aljamal says from her home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. \"We need someone to take over.\"As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs.\"Dr Ahmad Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, who was Hamas's political leader, is of the opinion that a firm grip is needed at present.\"As long as there are still people who try to take the law into their hands, we need somebody to scare them and squeeze them to the corner,\" says Dr Yousef, who now runs a Gaza think tank and remains close to the Hamas leadership.'As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs,' argues aid worker Hanya Aljamal \"This will take time. Not a long time. Within a month we will host those police forces and soldiers from Turkey and Egypt,\" he continues, referring to the international stabilisation force for Gaza, outlined in the peace plan, that could be composed of troops from Egypt and Turkey, among others. \"This is the moment where they will set their guns aside.\"Other Gazans are more sceptical, and fearful. Some aren't convinced that Hamas will give up their power - or weapons at all.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer imprisoned several times by Hamas, is one of them. AFP via Getty ImagesMany Palestinians and Israelis doubt Hamas is willing to step back from a political roleHe has been in hiding since July, when he says masked Hamas gunmen came to his Gaza City apartment and ordered him to report to al-Shifa hospital for interrogation.\"Hamas is [sending] a message to the world and to President Donald Trump… that they will neither relinquish power nor hand over their weapons.\"If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head,\" he says in one of a series of videos sent to us from an undisclosed location in the Gaza Strip. The wall behind him is riddled with bullet holes.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer: 'If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head'\"It is a gang, not a government,\" he says of Hamas. \"I don't want them to remain in Gaza… I don't want them in government, and I don't want them in security. I don't want to see their ideas spread in mosques, in the streets, or in schools.\"'Still the dominant player in Gaza'Mr al-Natour has his own take on what Gaza could look like.The disparate array of militias now under Hamas assault could, in his view, be integrated into a new security apparatus. But with their competing agendas, sometimes murky pasts and, in some cases, controversial links to the Israeli military, it's a problematic proposition.\"The fact is – and sometimes it's very hard for Israelis to admit this – that Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza.\" says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence.\"Relying on suspicious players - clans, militias, gangs, many of them criminals, many of them affiliated with ISIS [the Islamic State group], many of them involved in terror attacks against Israel - and considering them as a kind of alternative to Hamas is an illusion.\"'Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza' says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military IntelligenceHamas officials have said the group is willing to hand over political control of Gaza. The Trump ceasefire plan, to which it gave its qualified support, envisages \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\".But even if the group is willing to step back from a political role – something many Palestinians and Israelis still doubt - persuading its battle-hardened fighters to lay down their weapons is a big step for an organisation whose power, even before October 2023, relied heavily on the force of arms.Rise of Hamas and its iron gripTo begin to answer the complex question of what may happen to Hamas next requires delving backwards into how exactly it consolidated power in the first place.From its origins in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and a rival to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas morphed into a violent militant group responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians.Initially, Israel offered discreet support to Hamas, seeing it as a useful counterweight to the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah, led at the time by Yasser Arafat.\"The major enemy was Fatah,\" says Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, \"because they were the people who demanded a Palestinian state.\"But when Hamas launched deadly suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s and 2000s on Israelis, Israel responded with a series of high-profile assassinations.A violent power struggle with Fatah left Hamas, which won a 2006 election, in sole control of the Gaza Strip.Eighteen years of Hamas rule have followed, characterised by an Israeli military and economic blockade, and bouts of armed conflict in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021.Despite Israeli claims since October 2023 that \"Hamas is ISIS\", the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously convinced itself that Hamas did not pose a strategic threat.\"His was a policy of managing the conflict,\" says Mr Ayalon. \"He said we are not going to solve it and we are totally against the reality of two states, so the only way is to divide and control.\"With Hamas in control in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, ruling in part of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinians remained hopelessly divided, enabling Israel to argue that it had no unified leadership to negotiate peace with.\"[Netanyahu] did everything in order to support Hamas in Gaza,\" Mr Ayalon says. \"He let Qatar send them… more than $1.5bn.\"Getty ImagesIsrael has gone to enormous lengths to eliminate Hamas's key political and military figuresThe money from Qatar was meant to pay the wages of civil servants and support the poorest families, but security chiefs feared it was being used for other purposes.Mr Ayalon adds: \"It was clear to the director of the Shin Bet and the head of Mossad that this money would go to military infrastructure.Netanyahu has defended allowing payments to Hamas, saying it was meant to aid the civilian population.Hamas was always preparing for warAs 7 October brutally revealed, Hamas was always preparing for war. Nowhere was this more obvious than in its elaborate network of tunnels.Tunnels had already been used to mount attacks on Israeli army positions during the second Palestinian uprising, or \"Intifada\" that began in 2000.In 2006, Hamas fighters used a tunnel under the border with Israel to attack a military post near Kerem Shalom, killing two Israel soldiers and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. He was held for five years until his release, in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, who would go on to mastermind the Hamas attacks of October 2023.Getty ImagesYahya Sinwar, one of those behind the Hamas attacks of October 2023Over time, Hamas' tunnel network expanded, to include workshops, weapons-manufacturing sites and command centres.Regional developments also played a role. In 2012, after the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the brief rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas was able to smuggle increasingly sophisticated weapons into Gaza, including sniper rifles, mobile rocket launchers and equipment for the manufacture of long-range rockets.Hamas is thought to have benefitted from the help of technicians and fighters with experience of tunnelling in places like Lebanon and Iraq.Iran was also a key supporter, seeing Hamas as a natural component in its \"Axis of Resistance,\" a loose coalition of militant groups across the Middle East with a shared antipathy towards Israel and the United States.In 2020, a US State Department report said that Iran was providing around $100m a year to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesOver time, Hamas' tunnel network expandedSome tunnels were reportedly dug as deep as 230ft (70m) below ground, took years to build and cost tens of millions of dollars each. These were designed to protect senior Hamas commanders and house long-range weapons.A local expert with extensive knowledge of the tunnels told the BBC the cost of the entire project totalled roughly $6bn (£4.5bn).Precise figures are hard to come by, but it's thought that the scattered network extended for as much as 250 miles (400km), in a strip of land just 26 miles long and, at its widest, seven miles across.Tunnels: a project shrouded in secrecyPublic discussion of the tunnels - their location or cost - could expose Gazans to accusations of espionage, leading to arrest and worse. But many knew what was happening. Local residents would see the tell-tale signs: sand and clay being removed, new entrances appearing unexpectedly and machinery being brought in under cover of darkness.What began as an opportunistic response to Gaza's isolation became, over the span of three decades, a multi-layered subterranean industrial and military complex.It emerged later that much of it was concealed under Gaza's civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and, in the case of a tunnel containing a Hamas data centre, the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesAt least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since since October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministryAfter 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, it also became a massive underground prison. Not all of those held hostage were concealed in tunnels, but many were, especially as the war ground on.Eli Sharabi, who became one of the most high profile of those taken, was first moved from a safe house into a tunnel after 52 of his 491 days in captivity. \"They tied us with ropes in our legs and hands,\" he told the BBC earlier this month. \"I fainted from time to time from the pain. One time they broke my ribs.\"By the time he was released, in February, he had lost more than 30kg (4st 10lb).EPAEli Sharabi, who was held hostage, was moved from a safe house into a tunnel. 'They tied us with ropes,' he has saidHamas used the hostages as bargaining chips, to secure ceasefires or the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As negotiations over their fate continued, Hamas drip fed the Israeli public with a cruel series of videos, often showing the hostages in situations of extreme distress.Eventually it was, says Dr Yousef, internal and external pressure that forced Hamas to abandon the strategy.\"Qatar, Egypt and Turkey and also the people here in displacement camps sent a strong message to Hamas leaders outside that enough is enough.\"Getty ImagesIsrael assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024In the meantime, Israel continues to destroy what it can of the tunnel network, often demolishing civilian neighbourhoods above in the process.And the job is far from done.\"According to publications from the defence establishment, estimates speak of damage to between 25% and 40% of the tunnels,\" says Yehuda Kfir, an Israeli civil engineer and underground warfare researcher at Haifa's Technion University.\"No doubt [Hamas] aspires to rehabilitate the infrastructure, including restoring tunnels that were dealt with in various ways by the IDF.\"A leadership in tattersRestoring tunnels is one thing. Reconstituting the organisation is another. After the events of the past two years, Hamas' leadership is in tatters.Israel has gone to enormous lengths - in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon and Qatar - to eliminate the group's key political and military figures. From its best known, internationally recognisable leaders, travelling the world to promote their cause, to its battalion commanders on the ground in Gaza, Hamas has lost almost everyone of consequence.Israel assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024.

Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri (right) was killed in Beirut blastDespite the loss of these leading figures - and thousands of members of its armed wing - the group battled on, recruiting a fresh generation of radicalised young fighters and splintering into small cells intent on carrying out hit-and-run guerrilla-style operations.But Hamas in October 2025 is a pale shadow of the organisation that carried out the attacks of 7 October. Today's leaders are less well known and, crucially, have little political experience.Ezzedine al-Haddad, who is 55, now heads the five-member military council that commands Hamas' armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.EPA/ ShutterstockMany of the group's key political and military figures have been killed. (L-R) Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Sheikh Ahmed YassinOutside Gaza, the remnants of the group's political leadership include Khaled Meshaal (the subject of a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997), Khalil al-Hayya and Muhammad Darwish.All are believed to have escaped death on 9 September, when Israeli jets attacked a building in Doha, Qatar, where they were meeting to discuss the latest US ceasefire proposals.Hamas is 'tired of war'Despite the violence still raging in Gaza, the former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, says the group is tired of war. Without mentioning 7 October directly, he describes the cause of the war as a \"terrible mistake\" and that a \"different approach\" is needed.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPeople sit among the rubble and wreckage of war in Gaza. The former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, claims Hamas is also tired of war\"I'm talking to many of them and they have said that they are not interested in ruling Gaza anymore,\" he says. \"But Hamas has more than 100,000 members and those people are not going to disappear.\"Hamas, he suggests, is looking to rebrand itself in order to continue to play a political role in the future, a process he likens to the ANC's transition from guerrilla warfare to political rule in post-apartheid South Africa.\"If tomorrow there [are] elections,\" he says, \"I'm sure Hamas will come under different names, giving the impression it is more peaceful and more willing to be part of political life. \"Violence is not going to be part of any political party.\"Dr Milshtein is doubtful.\"Even if there will be a new local regime in Gaza, of course behind the scenes Hamas will be the dominant player,\" he argues.Anadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael may have to deal with Hamas for some time to comeDisarmament, he continues, is even less likely: he predicts another Gaza war within the next five years.But Ami Ayalon, the former Shin Bet chief, believes Israel should find another way to tackle its enemy.\"Unless we defeat the ideology, they will flourish,\" he says. \"The only way to defeat the ideology is by creating and presenting to the Palestinian and the Israeli people a new horizon. A horizon of two states.\"For now, that horizon does not exist, perhaps making Dr Milshtein's prediction more likely than Ami Ayalon's vision of a shared future.But Hamas, however diminished, is far from a spent force. One way or another, Israel may have to deal with it for some time to come.Additional reporting: BBC MonitoringTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "17 hours agoBasillioh Rukanga and Maia DaviesWatch: Four vehicles were involved in the crash on a major highway on the Kampala-Gulu HighwayForty-six people have been killed after several vehicles crashed on a major highway in Uganda, the police say.The police revised down an earlier death toll of 63, saying they had mistakenly included victims who were unconscious and were now being treated.The crash occurred when two buses travelling in opposite directions \"met head on\" while trying to overtake two other vehicles – a lorry and a car – on the Kampala-Gulu Highway at 00:15 local time (21:15 GMT), the Uganda Police Force said.One of the buses swerved in an attempt to avoid a crash, but in the process caused a \"head on and side collision\" that led to a \"chain reaction\" in which other vehicles lost control and overturned.As well as the fatalities, the passengers of the vehicles involved and several others were injured, police said. An investigation has been launched.The injured have been taken to different hospitals in the western town of Kiryandongo. In a statement, police said they were working with health and emergency services to verify the numbers and provide accurate updates as investigations continue into the cause of the tragedy.President Yoweri Museveni said he had learnt of the tragic accident \"with sadness\" and sent his condolences to the bereaved families. He urged caution to prevent such tragedies.He directed that each bereaved family be given five million shillings each ($1,430; £1,070) and a million shillings to the injured.The highway between the capital Kampala in the south and the northern city of Gulu is one of the country's busiest.Following the crash, police have urged motorists to avoid \"dangerous and careless overtaking\".It said this \"remains one of the leading causes of crashes in the country\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS forces have struck another vessel alleged to be carrying drugs, this time in the waters of the Pacific Ocean, the Pentagon said.According to defence secretary Pete Hegseth, two people on board the vessel were killed and no US forces were harmed. The vessel was known to US intelligence and was believed to be carrying drugs along a known trafficking route in international waters, Hegseth added.The strike marks the eighth US strike against suspected drug boats since 2 September - but the first in the Pacific.President Donald Trump said he has legal authority to continue bombing boats in international water but said he may go to the US Congress if he decides to expand targets on land.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do (it) by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. He said his administration was \"totally prepared\" to expand the anti-drug operations on land, which would mark a deep escalation. In the Oval Office with Trump, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that \"if people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States\".Video of the strike appears to show a long, blue speed boat moving through the water before being struck by US ordinance. \"Narco-terrorists intending to bring position to our shores will find no safe harbour anywhere in our hemisphere,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Just as Al Qaeda wages war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people.\" \"There will be no refuge or forgiveness - only justice,\" he added. In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.At least 34 people have been killed in the American strikes on alleged drug boats, including a recent strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean.Two men survived a strike last week, and were repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador. Ecuador's government later released one man - identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño - saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing. The other man, from Colombia, reportedly remains hospitalised. US President Donald Trump and administration officials have repeatedly justified the strikes as counter-narcotics measures necessary to fight drug-trafficking organisations, several of which have been designated as terrorist organisations by the US. Citing a defence official, CBS has reported that the strike took place in international waters near Colombia. Speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump defended the operations, calling them \"a national security problem\".News of the strike comes amid rising tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\".\"He better watch it or we'll take very serious action against him and his country,\" Trump said. \"He has led his country into a death trap.\"On Sunday, Trump denounced Petro as an \"illegal drug leader\" who is \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia.\"Trump added that the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, which has historically been one of its closest allies in Latin America. Both Colombia and nearby Ecuador have significant Pacific coastlines that experts have said are used to funnel drugs north towards the US through Central America and Mexico. US estimates from the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, indicate that the vast majority of cocaine bound for US cities passes through the Pacific. Drug seizures in the Caribbean - where the bulk of confirmed US strikes have so far taken place - account for a relatively small percentage of the total, although US officials have warned it is rising.To date, US officials have offered few details on the identities of those killed in the strikes or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belong to.Around 10,000 US troops, as well as dozens of military aircraft and ships, have been deployed to the Caribbean as part of the operation.",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéJudges in Cameroon have dismissed calls for the partial or total cancellation of the heavily disputed presidential election, saying they will announce the result on Monday.Major cities in the country have been rocked by protests, with opposition supporters alleging that the 12 October poll was marred by irregularities, including ballot-stuffing. Judges on the Constitutional Council dismissed eight petitions, citing insufficient evidence of irregularities or a lack of jurisdiction to annul results. Opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary has declared himself the winner - a claim rejected by allies of 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who is seeking another seven-year term.Biya has been in power for 43 years, and addressed only one campaign rally ahead of the election. Tchiroma Bakary, 76, is a former government spokesman who broke ranks with Biya to challenge him for power. He refused to file complaints with the Constitutional Council, whose judges have been appointed by Biya, choosing instead to declare himself the \"legal and legitimate president\". Can the world's oldest president keep his title?The African president who keeps defying death rumoursIn a video statement posted on social media, Tchiroma Bakary said he had won the election with about 55% of the vote, based on what he waid were returns representing 80% of the electorate.\"If the Constitutional Council proclaims falsified and truncated results, it will be complicit in a breach of trust,\" he declared.Tchiroma Bakary also warned that \"with their backs against the wall, the people will have no choice but to take their destiny into their own hands and seek victory wherever they can find it\".Biya's ruling party has dismissed his claims of victory and several officials have described it as illegal because only the Constitutional Council can proclaim official results.The influential Catholic Church this week urged the judges to ensure that the verdict reflected the will of voters.The growing tensions have sparked fears of post-electoral violence in a country already rocked by a separatist conflict in the Anglophone regions and Boko Haram insurgency in the Far North region.",

    "body": "At least 42 people have been killed in an oil tanker explosion in Nigeria's central Niger state after the vehicle skidded off the road and crashed, spilling fuel, an aid worker has told the BBC.Another 52 people with varying degrees of injuries are currently receiving treatment at a hospital, said Abdullahi Baba Ara, head of the Niger state emergency service.Villagers rushed to collect fuel from the overturned tanker which suddenly exploded, setting off a massive fire that engulfed them. Tanker explosions are a recurring tragedy in Nigeria, despite repeated warnings about the dangers of collecting spilled fuel. The intense blaze burned many victims beyond recognition, and the injured were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.The accident occurred near the Essan and Badeggi communities along the Bida-Agaie road in the Katcha Local Government Area of Niger state.The Nigerian truckers risking attackDriver of burning fuel tanker honoured for heroismNiger State Governor Mohammed Umaru Bago sent his condolences to the people, describing the incident as \"worrisome, unfortunate and pathetic\".\"[It] is disheartening how people have continued to approach a fallen tanker to scoop its contents\" despite several awareness campaigns, said a statement by his chief press secretary Bologi Ibrahim.The tanker, carrying petroleum products from Lagos in southern Nigeria to the north, is said to have crashed due to the bad condition of the road.Poor road conditions are a major contributor to road accidents in the country.In October last year, a fuel tanker explosion killed 153 people in Jigawa state, north-west Nigeria.In January this year, a truck carrying about 60,000 litres of petrol overturned near Suleja, also in Niger state, killing at least 86 people and injuring nearly 70 others.",

    "body": "14 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Rachel HaganElon Musk's SpaceX says it has cut Starlink satellite communication links to more than 2,500 devices used by scam compounds in Myanmar.More than 30 compounds are believed to be operating along the Thai-Myanmar border, where people from around the world are trafficked and forced to work on scams generating tens of billions of dollars annually.Announcing the move, Lauren Dreyer, head of Starlink business operations, said the firm takes action on the rare occasion it identifies violations.The service's termination follows Monday's takeover of one of the largest compounds, KK Park, by the Myanmar military, as it retakes territory lost to insurgent groups over the past two years.Campaigners have long warned that Starlink technology has enabled the mainly Chinese crime syndicates to operate from remote locations along the border.Myanmar has become infamous for these operations, which defraud victims through romantic ploys and bogus investment schemes. Workers are lured under the guise of legitimate jobs, only to be held captive and forced into criminal activity.Survivors recount gruelling conditions, long hours, torture and beatings for failing to meet targets. Many of the victims come from African countries.\"In Myanmar... SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected 'scam centers',\" Dreyer said in a post on X.\"We are committed to ensuring the service remains a force for good and sustains trust worldwide: both connecting the unconnected and detecting and preventing misuse by bad actors,\" she added.On Monday Myanmar's military said it had \"cleared\" KK Park, releasing more than 2,000 workers and confiscating 30 Starlink terminals. Photographs show the satellite dishes on the compound's rooftops and footage supplied to the BBC showed thousands of workers leaving KK Park on foot.However, at least 30 other scam compounds remain active along the border, employing tens of thousands globally. Many are protected by militia groups loyal to the Myanmar military and it is unclear whether they have also lost access to Starlink services they once relied on.These centres have become a key component of Myanmar's wartime economy, as the junta battles various rebel groups while relying on Chinese support to maintain its hold on power.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAoife WalshWashingtonWatch as parts of White House East Wing torn downUS President Donald Trump has said the \"existing structure\" of the White House East Wing must be torn down in order to construct a new $250m (£186m) ballroom.  Crews began demolishing parts of the structure on Monday, and two administration officials earlier told the BBC's US partner CBS that it will be completely torn down by the weekend.It marks a significant expansion of the construction project announced over the summer. Trump previously said his ballroom addition would not \"interfere with the current building\". He rejected accusations he had not been transparent over the extent of the works, telling reporters on Wednesday: \"I think we've been more transparent than anyone's ever been.\" The White House has served as the historic home of the US president for two centuries. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and was last modified in 1942.It is a section of the White House that holds offices for the first lady and other staff, as well as meetings and special events. Trump said the building had gone through several changes over the years and was \"very, very much changed from what it was originally\". He added that was \"never thought of as being much\" and that the changes have been wanted \"for at least 150 years\". The construction was being fully funded by Trump and \"some friends of mine - donors\". The military is also involved, he added.Getty ImagesConstruction work began on MondayGetty ImagesThe US president announced construction had begun in a social media post on Monday, saying \"ground has been broken\" on the \"much-needed\" ballroom space.He said that the East Wing was \"completely separate\" from the White House, although it is attached to the main structure.The Trump administration officials told CBS it was always the case that the East Wing would have to be modernised to enhance security and technology, but that during the planning process, it became apparent that the best option would be to demolish the entirety of the East Wing.Trump says White House renovation is 'music to my ears' as criticism mountsWho is paying for Trump's White House ballroom?His comments came after the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Washington non-profit organisation that protects historic US sites, wrote a letter to White House officials saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by the project.The trust asked Trump to pause demolition work, arguing that the White House was a national historic landmark and that officials needed to hold a public review process of the plan for the ballroom.Some Democrats have been critical of the renovation, including Hilary Clinton, who ran against Trump for the US presidency in 2016.In a post on X, she wrote that the White House was not Trump's house, and \"he's destroying it\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoKhanyisile NgcoboJohannesburgSouth African authorities have suspended eight pupils linked to a case of alleged bullying that has caused national outrage.A video showing a horrific assault at Milnerton high school in Cape Town last week has been widely shared on social media.Several boys are seen repeatedly hitting a fellow pupil with various objects, including a hockey stick, hose pipe and belt. According to reports, the boy was one of nine allegedly assaulted.Angry parents gathered outside the school on Wednesday in protest and were dispersed by police firing tear gas.They were joined by members of political parties who announced planned demonstrations at the school.Bullying in schools is a significant problem in South Africa, with videos depicting the violent attacks often going viral. This latest clip is among the most horrific to emerge in recent years.The mother of the 16-year-old boy being attacked in the video told local online publication, News24, that her son had had cancer and had completed his chemotherapy earlier this year.\"My child had just beaten cancer [only] for something like this to happen to him,\" she is quoted as saying.The teen's uncle later told local broadcaster eNCA that the boy had since been removed from the school.Various organisations have also condemned the incident, which took place on 16 October, while the police have confirmed that an assault case has been opened.Among those to speak out was Amnesty International South Africa, which said the video was \"deeply disturbing\" and called for \"timely disciplinary action\".The video, which is just over two minutes long, shows the boy pleading with his attackers to stop hitting him. While he makes this impassioned plea, one of the boys hits him again with a belt, eliciting laughter from some of the others. Some of the boys are also seen making funny faces and cheering the boy's attackers as the camera pans across the room.\"No child should ever endure such brutality in a space where [pupils] should be safe and protected from harm,\" the international human rights organisation said in a post on X.South Africa's education ministry said it had been in contact with the Western Cape education department, which has oversight over the school, and confirmed that the suspended pupils would face disciplinary action.The provincial department said it was \"treating the matter with the seriousness it warrants\".Both bodies have urged the public not to share the video of the assault or details of those involved, saying that this \"not only exacerbates the trauma experienced by the victim but also undermines the rights and dignity of all the [pupils] involved\".The chairperson of parliament's education committee also shared her \"utter horror and deep concern\" over the video.Joy Maimela said that the incident \"is not merely bullying but borders on assault – a criminal offence that demands urgent and decisive action from all relevant authorities\".",

    "body": "Mosquitoes have been found in Iceland for the first time after the country experienced record-breaking heat this spring.Insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason encountered the mosquitoes over several nights last week while using wine-soaked ropes to observe moths, local media reported.Mr Hjaltason found two female mosquitoes and one male which were later confirmed to be Culiseta annulata, one of few species that can successfully survive winter.Iceland was one of only two mosquito-free havens in the world prior to the discovery, partly due to its cold climate. The only other recorded mosquito-free zone is Antarctica.The mosquitoes were found in Kjós, a glacial valley to the South West of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik.Mr Hjaltason shared the news of his discovery on a Facebook page for local wildlife alongside pictures of the insects, describing \"a strange fly on a red wine ribbon\", according to Icelandic media.\"I could tell right away that this was something I had never seen before\" he said in the post, which was screenshotted and shared by Iceland's Morgunblaðið news site, adding \"the last fortress seems to have fallen.\"Mr Hjaltason sent the insects to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History to be identified, where entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson confirmed his suspicions.The species are common across parts of Europe and North Africa but it it isn't clear how they reached Iceland, Alfreðsson told CNN. Iceland's cold climate and lack of stagnant water in which the insects can breed are key contributors to the country's former lack of mosquitoes, the World Population Review said.But this year, the country broke multiple records for its high temperatures. Typically, Iceland rarely experiences highs of more than 20C (68F) in May, and when it does those heatwaves will last for no more than two to three days, its Met Office notes. That threshold was exceeded for 10 consecutive days this year in different parts of the country, though.Iceland also saw its hottest ever day in May, with temperatures reaching 26.6C (79.8F) at Eglisstaðir Airport.A June study published by the Global Heat Health Information Network noted that such shifts could have \"significant\" impacts on delicate ecosystems, which have adapted to the cold climate and are sensitive to temperature shifts.Last year was the world's hottest on record, and the UN's climate body has established that human influence has \"unequivocally\" warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land.Further monitoring will be required in spring to see if the mosquito species has \"truly become established in Iceland\", Alfreðsson added.Hjaltason, meanwhile, has speculated on the origin of the specimens he observed.\"One always suspects Grundartangi - it's only about six kilometers from me, and things often arrive with ships and containers, so it's possible something came in that way,\" he told Morgunblaðið.\"But if three of them came straight into my garden, there were probably more.\"",

    "body": "Singaporean women acquitted over pro-Palestinian walk1 day agoTessa WongAsia Digital ReporterProvided by Kokila AnnamalaiSiti Amirah Mohamed Asrori, Kokila Annamalai and Mossammad Sobikun Nahar had been charged with organising an illegal processionA court in Singapore has acquitted three women who organised a walk to the presidential office to show support for the Palestinian cause.The women were prosecuted for organising an illegal procession. But a judge ruled their actions did not meet the full charge.One of the women told the BBC she felt that the unexpected acquittal would \"give a new sense of energy and hope\" to activists in Singapore.Public demonstrations are uncommon in Singapore, which has very strict rules against protests and requires a police permit for any gathering promoting a cause. Authorities have also effectively banned public gatherings related to the Israel-Gaza war.Any permit applications for public assemblies related to the Israel-Gaza war would be turned down because of the \"real risk that such events could give rise to public disorder\", as the war was a sensitive topic, authorities have said.Singapore's government has argued that rules on demonstrations are necessary to maintain peace and harmony in the tiny country. Critics say that these rules stifle freedom of expression and civil activism.The latest case centred on an event organised in February 2024 by community organiser Mossammad Sobikun Nahar and content creator Siti Amirah Mohamed Asrori. They were assisted by community organiser Kokila Annamalai.About 70 people showed up to take part in the walk from a shopping mall to the presidential office, known as the Istana.Pictures of the event posted online showed the participants carrying umbrellas painted to look like watermelons, a symbol associated with the Palestinian cause.Prosecutors later charged the three women for organising a procession without a permit in a prohibited area.During their trial, the defence argued that the women had not known that their route on the perimeter of the Istana was in a prohibited area as they had travelled along public roads.While the judge ruled that the women had indeed organised a procession, they also would \"not have any inkling that using that route would be illegal or prohibited\".He noted they had used a public pavement and there were no signs indicating it was a prohibited area. \"It is clear from the evidence that the three of them were trying their level best not to run afoul of the law,\" he said.If they had been convicted, each of the women could have been fined up to S$10,000 (£5,760; US$7,705), or jailed for up to six months, or received both penalties.Provided by Kokila AnnamalaiThe three women posed with their supporters on Tuesday outside the State Courts in SingaporeThe trial drew some attention in Singapore. Pictures of the three women dressed in clothing in the colours of the Palestinian flag and keffiyeh scarves for their court appearances went viral online.Ms Annamalai told the BBC that the women deliberately chose their outfits to send a statement and \"show our defiance and solidarity\".With activists in the past convicted for holding unlawful public assemblies - even if they were only attended by one person - some had expected the women to receive convictions.Local media reports on Tuesday said there were \"loud gasps\" when the verdict was read out in the courtroom packed with the women's supporters.Ms Annamalai said she had been \"fully prepared to be convicted\" and that their acquittal \"came as a surprise\".\"But it is also difficult to feel celebratory about it because we shouldn't have been charged in first place,\" she added.She said their acquittal \"can provide that new sense of energy and hope\" as there was a \"long fight ahead\" for the civil rights movement and supporters of Palestine in Singapore. \"The community needed a win,\" she said.In a statement to the BBC, Singapore's prosecutorial office said it would file an appeal.Police have launched investigations into other offline and online events related to the Israel-Gaza war.The latest was in January when a group of local university students organised a memorial event for Palestinian students in front of a building said to house a research centre operated by an Israeli university. Six people have been questioned.The Singapore government has consistently supported the two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, and has supported Palestine's membership in the United Nations.In September, Singapore's foreign minister said they would recognise a Palestinian state \"when it has an effective government that accepts Israel's right to exist and categorically renounces terrorism\".",

    "body": "Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now2 days agoAna Faguy, James FitzGerald and Nardine SaadGetty ImagesThe pair's divorce was finalised in 2007The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair's tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears's allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book's release by publisher Listenin. He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.When they were teenagers, the couple's sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. \"They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - 'Oh, you're awake?' - with a knife in her hand,\" he writes. \"Then she'd turn around and pad off without explanation.\"Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: \"The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it's racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we're getting close to the 11th hour.\"He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears's life were controlled by others for years, and described it as a \"lifeline\" in its early days.He claims Spears saw the events in her life \"through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one\", but that she \"needed help\" and was \"in no state to responsibly manage her own affairs\".Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could \"never fully get behind it\".What's the history of their relationship?The pair got together in the summer of 2004, as Spears's initial commercial peak started to wane.They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.She made headlines with incidents like shaving her head and hitting a photographer's car with an umbrella.Those public incidents raised concern about her mental welfare, and after she was taken to hospital twice, a temporary conservatorship was established in 2008 and made permanent later that year.Spears remained under that controversial arrangement until 2021, under which her father and others controlled her finances and aspects of her personal life. She did not regain custody of her children until after it was lifted.Federline recalls that time as being \"like watching someone slowly lose control of their life\".\"I've lost faith that things will ever fully turn around, but I still hope that Britney can find peace,\" he adds.What has Spears said? Spears has accused Federline of attacking her during his recent press appearances to promote the book. She described the contents of the memoir as \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\", but suggested the work would sell better than her own memoir had done.In that book, The Woman in Me, Spears accused her ex-husband of trying to \"convince everyone I was completely out of control\".Spears has also defended her relationship with her sons. \"I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys,\" she wrote on social media on 15 October, adding that \"relationships with teenage boys is complex\".In a statement to US media, a Spears spokesperson added: \"With news from Kevin's book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James, and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.\"The BBC has contacted Federline's lawyer for comment on Spears's counter-accusations.Why is this happening now?While the pair dominated headlines during their relationship and subsequent divorce, Federline in particular has largely remained out of the limelight in recent years. And recently, the spotlight on Spears has largely been over her social media postings.Federline has said he considered writing a book for many years but wanted to wait until his children were older to complete it because he did not want make the weight of the world \"heavier\" on their shoulders.\"This is about finally telling my story,\" he writes. \"My version. In my words. Because everybody else has done it for me. The media. The blogs. The exes. The strangers. The jokes. The headlines. They all had something to say about me. And I stayed quiet.\"He denies claims that he \"was just coasting off her money\" and insists he was \"out there hustling, grinding, investing —working to build a solid foundation for myself and my kids\".He says he avoided responding publicly to media reports about him over the years because he wanted to protect his loved ones and give his kids \"some kind of normal life\".\"But silence didn't bring peace. It left me choking on the words I never said,\" he adds.",

    "body": "Trump says Putin talks 'don't go anywhere' as he imposes new sanctions 33 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Max Matza'It was time', says Trump on increase in Russia sanctionsThe US has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies - Rosneft and Lukoil - in an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere. They just don't go anywhere,\" President Donald Trump said, after a meeting with Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte to discuss peace negotiations. The sanctions announcement came one day after Trump said a meeting planned with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest would be shelved indefinitely.Earlier Wednesday, Russia unleashed an intense bombardment on Ukraine that killed at least seven people, including children. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the new sanctions were needed due to \"Putin's refusal to end this senseless war\". He said these oil companies fund the Kremlin's \"war machine\". \"Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,\" Bessent said in a statement.Speaking alongside Rutte in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump criticised Putin for not being serious about making peace and said he hoped that the sanctions would help force a breakthrough.\"I just felt it was time. We waited a long time,\" Trump said.He called the sanctions package \"tremendous\", and added that he hoped they could be swiftly withdrawn if Russia agrees to stop the war. Rutte also praised the move, saying it was \"putting more pressure\" on Putin.\"You have to put pressure, and that is just what he did today,\" Rutte said.Getty ImagesTrump and Putin met in Alaska in August in hopes of ending the war in Ukraine. A second meeting has now been shelved. The move comes as key differences between US and Russian proposals for peace became increasingly clear this week. Trump has indicated that a key sticking point has been Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US still wanted to meet Russia.Last week, the UK slapped a similar sanctions package on Rosneft and Lukoil.\"There is no place for Russian oil on global markets,\" UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves said while announcing the move.Responding to the UK, Russia's embassy in London said targeting its country's major energy companies would disrupt global fuel supplies and drive up costs worldwide.It also said the sanctions would have \"a detrimental impact on the energy security\" of developing and underdeveloped countries, adding \"pressure only complicates peaceful dialogue and leads to further escalation\".The two Russian oil firms export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day. Rosneft is responsible for nearly half of all Russian oil production, which makes up 6% of the global output, according to estimates from the UK government.Oil and gas are Russia's biggest exports, and Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey. Trump has also urged these countries to halt purchases of Russian oil in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin.Trump's move was praised by UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who said the US sanctions are \"strongly welcome\". Children among victims in Russian strikes, hours after Trump-Putin talks shelvedWhy Trump made breakthrough in Gaza but can't with Putin over UkraineEU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen posted on X that she spoke by phone to Bessent on Wednesday about \"Russia's lack of commitment to the peace process\". She also praised a new sanctions package approved by the European Union on Wednesday, which includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports.\"With the imminent adoption of the EU's 19th package, this is a clear signal from both sides of the Atlantic that we will keep up collective pressure on the aggressor,\" she wrote.Earlier this year, the UK and US also sanctioned major Russian energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas.At the White House, Rutte was expected to discuss a 12-point plan formulated by European NATO allies and Kyiv, which would see the current front lines frozen, a return of deported children as well as a prisoner exchange between the two warring countries. The plan also includes a war recovery fund for Ukraine, as well as security pathways and a clear pathway for Ukraine to join the EU, as well as increased military aid to Kyiv and economic pressure on Moscow. Earlier this week, Trump said he did not want a \"wasted meeting\" with Putin in Budapest, and suggested a main point of contention is Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front lines of the war. He last met with Putin in Alaska for a summit the White House hoped would lead to the end of the conflict. Instead, the fighting has continued. A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was also shelved. The meeting this week was no longer \"necessary\" after a \"productive\" call, the White House said. Trump has repeatedly endorsed proposals to freeze the fighting along current frontlines. \"Let it be cut the way it is,\" he said on Monday. \"I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"Europe's leaders back Trump call for frontline freeze but Russia says noRussia has pushed back against that idea, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying that \"the consistency of Russia's position doesn't change\" -  a reference to its desire for Ukrainian troops to leave the Donbas region in Ukraine's east. On Wednesday, Trump also pushed back against reporting in the Wall Street Journal that the US had approved Ukrainian long-range missile strikes into Russia, calling it \"fake news\". Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky has expressed a desire for the US to supply long-range US Tomahawk missiles to his forces and suggested that the threat of their introduction to the war theatre may bring Russia to the negotiating table.

    "body": "No camera covered Louvre wall where jewel thieves broke in, director says8 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe editor and Dearbail JordanWatch: \"Heist made it more exciting to go to the Louvre\", says tourist as museum reopensThe Louvre failed to spot a gang of thieves early enough to stop the theft of €88m (£76m) worth of French crown jewels, the museum's director has revealed.Laurence des Cars, speaking publicly for the first time since the heist on Sunday, told French senators that CCTV around the Louvre's perimeter was weak and \"aging\".The only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where they broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to Gallery of Apollo housing the jewels, she said.\"We failed these jewels,\" she said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".Ministers have given press conferences and interviews and denied security failings, but des Cars cut through that and admitted the Louvre had been \"defeated\".Her words gave an extraordinary insight into the difficulty of securing the world's most visited museum, and how bad its security really was.The CCTV system outside the Louvre was \"very unsatisfactory\" she said and inside, some areas were simply too old to adapt to modern technologies.Despite the museum's huge volume of visitors - 8.7 million last year alone - investment in security has been slow and she highlighted the budget challenges big institutions face.Des Cars, who became director of the Louvre in 2021, said she wanted to double the number of CCTV cameras.She said she was warned about how \"obsolete\" the equipment at the Louvre was when she took the job, in contrast to the modern equipment of the Musée d'Orsay, where she had worked previously.Some of the senators she faced at Wednesday's hearing expressed incredulity at the Louvre's security, asking why there was just one camera - on the external wall facing the river - and why it was pointing the wrong way. That single failure meant that the lorry carrying the gang and their mechanical ladder, used to reach the gallery's first floor, was not spotted at all as it arrived at the foot of the Gallery of Apollo.\"There is a weakness at the Louvre and I acknowledge it completely,\" des Cars told the senators. She praised security guards who she said acted quickly to evacuate the building as soon as they were aware there had been an intrusion, but she conceded: \"We did not spot the arrival of the thieves early enough... the weakness of our perimeter protection is known.\"Getty ImagesLouvre director Laurence des Cars acknowledged that security cameras were far from satisfactoryThe museum re-opened on Wednesday, although the gallery remained shut.The Louvre is home to priceless works of art including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. A hunt is still under way for the gang of four who, over the space of less than 10 minutes last Sunday morning, broke into one of the world's most famous museums. They made off with eight prized pieces of jewellery including a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife.As they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged, and Laurence des Cars told the senators that it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case. \"Initial assessments suggest that a delicate restoration is possible,\" des Cars said.How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Some of the museum's problems she raised at the hearing included cuts in surveillance and security staff over the past decade and decaying infrastructure that could not handle the latest generation of video equipment.The director hopes that work to improve security will begin at the start of 2026. However, it is expected to be challenging given the aging infrastructure of what was once a royal palace.Des Cars said she had tendered her resignation to the culture ministry after the heist but had been refused. She told senators she had been raising concerns about the state of the Louvre for some time.She became animated, even indignant, as she defended herself from media allegations that she prioritised her own comfort ahead of protecting the Louvre and its historic collections.\"I am wounded as chair and director that the warnings I was raising, as a whistle-blower, in a sense, have come to pass last Sunday.\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she said.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio on Wednesday that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors have said their theory is that the robbers were under orders for a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "3 days agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesMuch of Virginia Giuffre's story has been heard before but in her memoir, published posthumously, the abuse is described in appalling detail.Two days ahead of the book's official publication, the BBC got hold of a copy.There are revelations about Ms Giuffre's encounters with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell - as well as more details of her allegations about Prince Andrew, which he has always denied.Here's what we learned from the 367-page-long book.Prince Andrew allegations - and an 'orgy'In the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions.The third time, she says, was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\".\"Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\" she says.\"The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English. Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.\"She later recalls seeing the photo of Epstein walking in New York's central park with Prince Andrew, published in newspapers around the world in 2011.\"I was of course revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll,\" she writes.\"But mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein\".Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In 2019, he told BBC Newsnight he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\", and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"News Syndication'Epstein told me I'd had a miscarriage'Shortly after the alleged \"orgy\" Ms Giuffre says she \"wasn't in great shape\", and had irregular bleeding and a tenderness in her abdomen.She says Epstein took her to a hospital, where she remembers being taken to an examination room. However, she says she is unclear what happened next due to pain medication affecting her memory.Soon after, she writes, one of the other girls in Epstein's house suggested to her that an incision mark near her belly button could mean she had surgery for an ectopic pregnancy.\"But Epstein told me I'd suffered a miscarriage, which is altogether something different,\" Ms Giuffre says.\"Epstein never wore a condom. Neither did the men he and Maxwell trafficked me to.\"Memories of Epstein 'torture' GiuffreAt the centre of the abuse was the late Epstein and his former girlfriend Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre says that even after many years, the memories of what Epstein put her through \"torture\" her - and says she she feared she might \"die a sex slave\" at the hands of Epstein and his circle.The memoir includes shocking descriptions of sadomasochistic sex.She says Epstein developed an interest in it over time, and began to \"experiment with whips and restraints and other instruments of torture\".\"In session after session, he would play out various fantasies, with me as the victim,\" she writes.She says the chains and contraptions he used on her \"caused so much pain that I prayed I would black out\". But she adds: \"When I did, I'd awaken to more abuse\".Ms Giuffre also details the physical effects such abuse had on her body, with dark circles under her eyes and her ribs visible beneath her skin.Rather than offering any care, Epstein was \"disgusted\" at her appearance, she says.\"'You're not the same girl you were,' Epstein said coldly. 'You need to clean yourself up',\" she writes in the book.Maxwell's part in the abuseMs Giuffre goes into detail about how she first met Maxwell, and how she introduced her to Epstein.She says Maxwell turned up at the Mar-a-Lago spa, where a teenage Ms Giuffre was working.\"She looks to be in her late thirties, and her British accent reminds me of Mary Poppins,\" Ms Giuffre recalls.She says Maxwell asked her to come for a job interview as a masseuse.When she arrived at the house, Ms Giuffre says she was taken to a room where Epstein was completely naked on a massage table. \"Just do what I do,\" she says Maxwell told her.Ms Giuffre says she started giving Epstein a massage. She says Maxwell then took her clothes off, and undressed Ms Giuffre, and they sexually abused her.\"The disappointment was excruciating. I blamed myself. 'Is sex all anyone will ever want from me',\" she writes.She later describes how Maxwell facilitated the introduction to Prince Andrew in March 2001.She writes that Maxwell woke her up and told her it was going to be a \"special day\" - that \"just like Cinderella\" she was going to meet a \"handsome prince\".Ms Giuffre later writes that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared both Epstein and Maxwell.Disappointment at Epstein's deathOne of the other themes running through the book is Ms Giuffre's desire for accountability.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre describes feeling disappointed at his death. \"This wasn't how justice was supposed to work out,\" she says.On Prince Andrew, she recalls standing outside a courtroom and telling journalists: \"He knows exactly what he's done… and I hope he comes clean about it.\"She later writes that she hopes the royal - who has always denied wrongdoing - will be \"held to account\".The most powerful words are perhaps saved for the ending of the book.\"In my mind, I hold a picture of a girl reaching out for help and easily finding it,\" Ms Giuffre writes.\"I picture a woman, too, who - having come to terms with her childhood pain - feels that it's within her power to take action against those who hurt her.\"If this book moves us even an inch closer to a reality like that - if it helps just one person - I will have achieved my goal.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoPeter RuddickBusiness reporterBBC/Lola DesignOnline shopping giant Temu has agreed to work with the greeting card industry to remove copied designs from its site more quickly.Card firms say hundreds of their copyrighted images have been used to create cheap rip-offs, costing them thousands of pounds in lost sales.Designers told the BBC the process for getting the plagiarised listings removed has been like the fairground game 'whack-a-mole' with copied products re-appearing within days.Temu said protecting intellectual property was a \"top priority\" and that it was encouraging sellers to join the trial of a new takedown process specifically for the greetings card industry.BBC/Lola DesignAmanda Mountain, the co-founder of York-based Lola Design, discovered the catalogue of designs she had built up over a decade had nearly all been copied.She found the images she had created had been lifted and were being advertised by other sellers on cards and other products like t-shirts.Amanda bought one of the cards using her design and found the image was distorted and the paper was of a poorer quality than hers.\"It's not a nice feeling to see something you've poured all your love and hours into taken within minutes,\" she told the BBC. \"I was in shock, and I actually thought to myself 'what is the point of me still designing, I might as well just stop now'.\"BBC/Citrus BunnAmanda, and her husband and business partner Frank, estimate that fraudulent versions of their products have made online sellers £100,000 in sales, equivalent to about 13% of Lola Design's annual turnover.However, Amanda said it is both the emotional toll and the time taken to get the copycat products removed that have had the biggest impact.\"Every piece that I create is actually a piece of me,\" she said. \"I know that sounds crazy, but it is. Every designer gives out a piece of themselves because they just want to create a little bit of happiness, and it is not much to ask for people to respect that.\"Lola DesignAfter pressure from the Greeting Card Association (GCA), Temu has now put in place a bespoke takedown process for the industry which, it says, will mean stolen designs are removed more quickly and won't be able to be re-uploaded.Previously, card firms would have to report each individual listing but, as part of the trial, they will now only have to submit one link. The software will remove the product and any others using the same design.One card publisher, who helped develop the new system, saw 68 listings removed automatically. Something which previously might have meant 68 separate forms or emails to Temu.According to the GCA, the system will then use AI to log the designer's original creation as a protected image. It will then block any products using that design before they appear for sale.BBC/Lola DesignIn a statement, Temu said \"intellectual property protection is a top priority\" and that it had \"invested heavily in resources to strengthen trust with brands, sellers and consumers\".It said most requests to take down copyrighted content were resolved within three working days, but that greeting card firms were being encouraged to join the new trial which it said would lead to more products being removed automatically.The system is bespoke to the card industry, however the BBC understands it could be used as a model for similar or alternative processes for other products. Amanda Fergusson, the chief executive of the GCA, said the industry welcomed the changes. \"We know our members feel very strongly about copycat sellers, and what's more we also know customers are often disappointed by cheap copies,\" she said.\"Our dialogue with Temu and the actions they're taking, is a welcome first-step to address those issues,\" she added.For Amanda and Frank, it is not just their livelihoods at stake but the future of the whole supply chain which relies on the 1.5bn greeting cards sold in the UK each year.\"At some point, its going to be the consumers that are going to be affected, not just us as designers, because there won't be any high streets,\" Amanda said. She also had a message for people buying copycat cards: \"Cheap always comes at a cost.\"",

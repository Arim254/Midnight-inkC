    "body": "A mountain of rubbish collapsed at a landfill in the central Philippines on Thursday, killing a 22-year-old woman and leaving 38 people missing, athorities said.Rescuers pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from debris at the Binaliw Landfill in Cebu City, who were later hospitalised.Many of the victims are believed to be workers at the landfill. The cause of the collapse is still unclear.Some 300 people from various government agencies and civilian groups have been deployed to the privately-owned landfill. Several excavators, ambulances and fire trucks are also seen on site.\"All response teams remain fully engaged in search and retrieval efforts to locate the remaining missing persons,\" Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Friday.Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said the incident may have happened suddenly, but was likely a result of poor waste management practices.Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman.\"It's not a sanitary landfill. It's already an open dumpsite,\" he said.Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.The Binaliw landfill is about 10 hectares (25 acres).",

    "body": "Tournament chiefs admit errors over viral wildcard Image source, ITFImage caption, Hajar Abdelkader's biography on the ITF website says she started playing tennis at the age of 14ByStewart MacleanBBC News, in NairobiThe organisers of a professional women's tournament which has gone viral on social media because of a wildcard player's dire performance have acknowledged she should not have been allowed to play.Egyptian Hajar Abdelkader, 21, lost 6-0 6-0 and served 20 double faults during the first-round match in Nairobi on Wednesday, with the footage leaving many viewers wondering if she had ever played tennis before.The amateur player won only three points during her 37-minute debut - two double faults by opponent Lorena Schaedel and an unforced error from the bemused German, ranked 1,026th in the world.The match was part of an International Tennis Federation (ITF) W35 tournament, hosted by Tennis Kenya, the governing body for the sport in Kenya.Tennis Kenya said it had reached out to both Abdelkader and Schaedel to offer its support \"given the extent and nature of coverage of this match\". Tennis Kenya said Abdelkader had applied to enter the tournament as a wildcard and had been given a space at the last minute following the withdrawal of another player.The organisation said she was permitted to enter to maintain a balance of players and nations represented in the tournament, but said that in hindsight she should not have been allowed to play.\"The federation has taken note of this experience and will ensure that such an extremely rare occurrence never happens again,\" the organisation added. \"Tennis Kenya remains committed to fairness, transparency and the integrity of competition, as well as to the continued development of tennis in Kenya, East Africa, and across Africa.\" The Egyptian Tennis Federation confirmed to the BBC Abdelkader has never been registered as an Egyptian player and had not been entered into the tournament on Egypt's behalf.Egyptian Tennis Federation technical director Dia Nabil Loutfy said: \"We would like to clarify that she is not registered with the Egyptian Tennis Federation, nor is she included in any of our official player lists.\"Based on the information available to us, the player was previously residing in Kenya and participated in the ITF tournament in Nairobi through a wildcard granted by the Kenyan Tennis Federation.\"The Egyptian Tennis Federation had no role whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly, in the nomination, approval, or issuance of this wildcard, and we were not involved in the player's entry into the tournament in any capacity.\"The organisation said it had no records relating to Abdelkader, and said she had never been affiliated with the Egyptian Tennis Federation.",

    "body": "17 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , BeirutThe Lebanese army says it has taken over security in the south of the country, which for decades had been dominated by the Iranian-backed movement Hezbollah, amid fears that Israel could escalate its military offensive against the group.Lebanon has been under intense international pressure, particularly from the US, to disarm Hezbollah, a powerful militia and political party, since a ceasefire deal in November 2024 ended a devastating year-long war between Israel and Hezbollah.The army had set a year-end deadline to clear the area south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel, of non-state weapons in the first phase of a government-backed plan.The army said its objective had been achieved in an \"effective and tangible way\" but that there was more work to be done to clear unexploded ordnance and tunnels.Responding to the Lebanese army's statement, the office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said efforts toward fully disarming Hezbollah were \"an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah's efforts to rearm and rebuild its terror infrastructure with Iranian support\".In recent months, Lebanese soldiers have dismantled infrastructure in areas once controlled by Hezbollah in the south without facing resistance from the group, which says it has complied with the ceasefire deal and removed its fighters from those areas, where Palestinian factions including Hamas had also operated.But US and Israeli officials have expressed frustration with the pace of the army's efforts. Israel has accused Hezbollah - which is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and the UK - of trying to recover its military capabilities, including in the south. In recent days, Israeli media reported that Netanyahu had been given a green light by US President Donald Trump to intensify its military campaign against Hezbollah.Despite the ceasefire, Israel has carried out near-daily attacks on targets it says are linked to Hezbollah and continues to occupy at least five positions in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese government rejects the Israeli claims, and says Israel's actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and an obstacle to the army's efforts.Israel has not made the evidence it says it has about Hezbollah's activities public, and the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as Unifil, says it has seen no indication that the group is rebuilding its infrastructure in the areas where it operates.Lebanese officials say the next stage of the army's plan will focus on the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which includes the port city of Sidon. There is no timeline for that, and the cash-strapped Lebanese army has also complained of insufficient funding and equipment.Meanwhile, it is unclear if Hezbollah will resist the measures in other areas as it says it will not disarm north of the Litani. The group also has a strong presence in the eastern Bekaa valley and in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as the Dahieh. Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has rejected the use of force against the group, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to violence.Hezbollah - which is also a political party with representation in parliament and in the government, and a social movement that runs hospitals and schools - still enjoys significant support among Lebanon's Shia community. Opponents, however, see this as a unique opportunity to disarm the group, after its losses in the war. Hezbollah, so far, has rejected calls from the authorities to discuss the future of its weapons.In Lebanon's south, tens of thousands of residents remain displaced and communities lie in ruins, as Lebanon's international partners have conditioned funds for reconstruction on measures that include action against Hezbollah.",

    "body": "15 hours agoDavid GrittenReutersPolice patrol Aden, from where the Saudi-led coalition said Aidarous al-Zubaidi had fled by boatThe Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has alleged the United Arab Emirates helped smuggle a separatist leader out of the country after he was expelled from Yemen's presidential council and accused of treason.A coalition spokesman said Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), fled Aden on Tuesday night in a boat to Somaliland. He was then flown by a cargo aircraft to Abu Dhabi via Mogadishu under the supervision of UAE officers, he added.There was no immediate comment from the UAE or STC.The STC insisted Zubaidi was still working from Aden on Wednesday, after the coalition said he had failed to fly to Riyadh for talks and had fled to an unknown location.The coalition also accused Zubaidi of moving STC forces from bases in Aden to his home province of al-Dahle and said it had carried out air strikes on them in response.The STC said the strikes, which reportedly killed four people, were \"unjustified\" and \"inconsistent\" with calls for dialogue with Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is overseen by the presidential council and backed by Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been allies in the war against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement over the past decade, but the infighting between the rival factions they support has deepened a rift between them and pushed southern Yemen to the brink of a new conflict.On Thursday, coalition spokesman Maj Gen Turki al-Malki said it had \"reliable intelligence\" showing Zubaidi and his associates fled from Aden's port in the early hours of Wednesday on board a St Kitts and Nevis-flagged passenger ship.The vessel sailed across the Gulf of Aden to Berbera in the breakaway region of Somaliland, where a Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft was waiting, he added.Malki said Zubaidi and his associates \"boarded the aircraft under the supervision of UAE officers\" and flew first to Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, before heading towards the Arabian Sea \"without a declared destination\".\"The aircraft disabled its identification systems over the Gulf of Oman, reactivating them only 10 minutes prior to landing at Al-Reef Military Air Base in Abu Dhabi,\" he added, without saying directly whether Zubaidi was still aboard.Somalia's immigration agency said it was investigating an \"alleged unauthorised use\" of its airspace and airports.ReutersThe Southern Transitional Council had said on Wednesday that Zubaidi was still in Aden (file photo)STC-aligned forces have in recent years taken control of much of southern Yemen, which they want once again to be an independent state, by pushing out forces loyal to the government.However, Saudi Arabia warned last week that the advances near the kingdom's borders constituted threats to its national security as well as the security and stability of Yemen.It also accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" its separatist allies to push into eastern Yemen and expressed support for a demand from the presidential council for all Emirati forces to leave.At the same time, the Saudi-led coalition - which was formed in 2015 by Arab states, including the UAE, after Houthi rebels seized control of north-western Yemen - struck what it said was a shipment of weapons and military vehicles for the STC that had arrived from the UAE.The UAE expressed \"deep regret\" at the Saudi accusations and denied there were any weapons, but agreed to pull its remaining forces out of the country.Since then, forces loyal to the government have retaken control of Hadramawt and al-Mahra with the help of coalition air strikes.Witnesses and government officials told Reuters news agency on Thursday that Aden was also now coming under the control of Saudi-backed forces.",

    "body": "14 hours agoChris GrahamandRachel HaganMore than one million people in south-eastern Ukraine spent hours without heating and water supplies as a result of Russian air strikes, officials have said. The attacks damaged infrastructure across the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region - as well as in neighbouring Zaporizhzhia. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, aimed at paralysing power supplies during a harsh winter. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused it of \"mockery\" and pleaded for Western support. He later said there were fears of \"a new massive Russian strike\" as Moscow was trying to take advantage of the weather, with heavy snow and frost expected across Ukraine. Hospitals, water facilities and other critical services in Dnipropetrovsk had to operate on backup systems, the energy ministry said, while residents were urged to limit electricity use to avoid further strain on the grid.DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive told the BBC last month, with most of Ukraine suffering from lengthy power cuts during winter.Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, which provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, said the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and his company had found it difficult to cope.\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure,\" Zelensky said on Thursday. He urged Ukrainians to remain \"resilient\" against Russia's attempts \"to break Ukraine\" and added that peace talks aimed at ending the war should not be a reason to slow down Western supplies for Ukraine's air defences.Zelensky has been on a diplomatic tour this week - meeting allies in the \"Coalition of the Willing\" and US President Donald Trump's peace envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Following those talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached - a move Moscow warned would make foreign forces a \"legitimate target\".But a day later, Zelensky said European allies had not given him sound guarantees that they would protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression.However, he also said he believed Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine could be brought to an end in the first half of 2026. Speaking at the opening of Cyprus's presidency of the EU for the next six months, he said negotiations with European partners and the US had entered a new stage and stressed that the EU should play a central role in any settlement.President Donald Trump has been leading efforts to bring the war to an end. His proposals - amended by Ukraine and its European allies - envisage Ukrainian territorial concessions to Russia in areas it does not already control in the country's east.Negotiations centre on those points - the last 10% of the deal, according to Zelensky. So far, Ukraine has refused to agree to cede territory to Russia.Once agreed, those proposals would need Russia's approval.Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no sign of backing down for his demands to annex the entire territory of the industrial eastern region of Donbas.His troops have been making slow progress in the past few months.",

    "body": "Australians in Victoria have been warned they should prepare for \"property loss or worse\" as much of the country faces extreme heatwave conditions. Temperatures on Friday and Saturday are forecast to hit record highs for most states and territories, with Victoria and South Australia in particular bracing for dangerous fire conditions due to strong winds and hot temperatures.A total fire ban is in place in Victoria and all regions across the state were given a \"catastrophic\" or \"extreme\" fire danger rating.\"Victorians should brace themselves for more property loss or worse,\" Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer Jason Heffernan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Friday.\"The conditions were extreme yesterday. They're catastrophic today,\" Heffernan said. Temperatures in Melbourne are expected to hit 42C on Friday and while areas in north-west Victoria may reach 45C, a cool change is forecast in the south-west.A bushfire near Longwood, central Victoria, has burnt through nearly 36,000 hectares, authorities said, with at least 20 homes in the small town of Ruffy destroyed.Ruffy CFA captain George Noye said the town had been \"severely\" affected.\"The main street looks like a bomb's gone off, we've lost a school,\" he told the ABC.\"Some properties have lost everything. They've lost their livelihoods, they've lost their shearing sheds, livestock, just absolutely devastating.\"But thankfully, at the moment, no lives have been lost.\"A statement from Victoria's state control centre on Friday said the Longwood fire was \"incredibly dynamic, with the fire spreading in multiple directions\" and may spread further than initial estimates. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Bob Hill said three people - two adults and a child - remain unaccounted for in the Longwood area.He said authorities spoke to them yesterday at their property, warning them to seek shelter as it was too late to evacuate. Fire officials returned later to find the home had burnt down but could not locate the three people.\"They may be safe, they may be alive, let's not get ahead of ourselves, but we are keeping an open mind,\" Hill said.In the Australian Capital Territory, which includes the capital Canberra, a total fire ban was declared for the first time in six years. Sydney will see the mercury rise up to 42C on Saturday, before dropping to around 26C by Sunday. Another fire near Walwa, north-east Victoria, has burned through more than 17,000 hectares.Heffernan urged all Victorians to be on high alert, not just those near active fires. \"That is how severe these conditions are at the moment, not only at the Longwood fire but across the state,\" he told the ABC.\"My message at the moment to Victorians is yes, we are talking about Longwood and Walwa, but we have many other fires that have started this morning in and around communities... I am expecting more as the day goes on.\"In South Australia, local fire authorities said they had battled a number of small fires across the state overnight and temperatures were expected to hit 46C in some areas.",

The White House said the decision was taken because those entities \"no longer serve American interests\" and promote \"ineffective or hostile agendas\".The memorandum was signed on Wednesday following a review, with the White House describing the organisations as \"a waste of taxpayer dollars\".\"These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities,\" it said in a statement.It added that many of the organisations promoted \"radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength\".As well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the US has also withdrawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on climate science that pulls together the most respected reports on the science of rising global temperatures.Sources within the organisation told the BBC that they were concerned about the potential impact of the Trump administration's withdrawal on US scientists involved in producing the body's next set of studies.The White House has already blocked US scientists attending a meeting in China.Any restrictions on travel or the participation of US researchers could significantly delay the release of the next set of IPCC reports, including potentially its mitigation report - a key document guiding governments on how to tackle climate change.Non-UN organisations affected by the US withdrawal include those focused on clean energy co-operation, democratic governance and international security, such as the International Solar Alliance, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. Trump has already stripped many multilateral organisations he dislikes of funds and previously rejected the scientific consensus of man-made climate change as a \"hoax\".It will take a year for the US to be able to fully withdraw from the UNFCCC - but in reality the US ceased effective participation in the UN's climate change body long ago.It remains unclear whether the move will be challenged in the US courts, as many campaigners are now urging.While the US constitution allows presidents to join treaties \"provided two thirds of Senators present concur\", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw. As such, it is uncertain a future president could reverse Trump's decision and opt back in simply by applying.These latest withdrawals come after the president  took the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time last year, and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. The US has also already withdrawn from the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN's cultural agency, Unesco.European leaders have criticised this latest decision, warning it would weaken global co-operation. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the UNFCCC \"underpins global climate action\" and called the US retreat \"regrettable and unfortunate\", while the EU's clean transition vice-president Teresa Ribera said the administration showed little concern for the environment, health or human suffering.A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a \"new low\".Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told news agency AFP that it was another sign the administration, which she described as \"authoritarian\" and \"anti- science\", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global co-operation.",

    "body": "The US has suspended all assistance to the government of Somalia, alleging that officials destroyed a UN World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse and seized \"donor-funded food aid\".\"The Trump administration has a zero-tolerance policy for waste, theft, and diversion of life-saving assistance,\" said a US state department statement on X.The message, posted on the account of the under secretary for foreign assistance, said reports had been received about officials illegally seizing 76 tonnes of food intended for \"vulnerable Somalis\".Somali has denied the allegations, saying that the expansion work under way in the Mogadishu port, where the warehouse is located, had not affected any aid storage.It stressed that all the humanitarian aid in question was still \"under the custody and control of the World Food Programme including assistance provided by the United States\".A WFP staff member in Mogadishu, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to the AFP news agency that the food aid had not been stolen.\"The warehouse was partially demolished during the weekend without the knowledge of the WFP team, but there was no looting involved,\" they said.The US said it would only resume assistance if the Somali government took \"accountability for its unacceptable actions and... appropriate remedial steps\".Although the US has withdrawn from several UN organisations under President Donald Trump, it remains by far the largest contributor to the WFP, paying $2bn (£1.5bn) in 2025 - almost a third of its total funding.Somalia's government is battling al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants as it tries to rebuild the country after a devastating civil war and years of drought.This is the latest example of the deteriorating relations between Washington and Mogadishu.Last month, Trump lashed out at Somali migrants living in the US, telling reporters they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\".Communities have been targeted in immigration raids as the government alleges large-scale benefit fraud in Minnesota, the US state with the largest Somali community in the US.The recent recognition by US ally Israel of the breakaway republic of Somaliland, which Somalia considers to be part of its territory, has further angered Mogadishu.The aid that was allegedly seized by Somali officials was meant to help people cope with the effects of \"drought, floods, conflict, high food prices and dwindling harvests\", according to the WFP.It quotes figures saying that 4.6 million people in Somalia are facing crisis levels of hunger.",

    "body": "17 hours agoTiffany WertheimerRenee Nicole GoodRenee Nicole Good was an award-winning poetThe woman shot dead by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who had just moved to the city.She was a prize-winning poet and a hobby guitarist, who city leaders have said was there as a legal observer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death has sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"probably terrified\" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot and that she was \"one of the kindest people I've ever known\".\"She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the daily newspaper. \"She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"Her father, Tim Ganger, told the Washington Post that \"she had a good life, but a hard life\".A fundraiser for Good's family, which was set up with a target of $50,000 (£37,000), raised more than $500,000 in 15 hours.In what appears to be Good's Instagram account, which has now been made private, Good described herself as a \"poet and writer and wife and mom\", who was \"experiencing Minneapolis\".A US citizen, Good was originally from Colorado Springs and had moved to Minneapolis just last year from Kansas City.The Minnesota Star Tribune reports that she used to host a podcast with her second husband, Tim Macklin, who died in 2023. They had a son together, who is now six years old, Macklin's father told the newspaper. She had two other children with her first husband, who spoke to US media on condition that his name was not used. He said that Good was not an activist and that she was a devoted Christian who went to Northern Ireland on youth missions when she was younger.She had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union, but had mainly been a stay-at-home mum in recent years, according to the Associated Press.Getty ImagesPeople have left flowers, candles and messages at a make-shift memorial for Good in MinneapolisGood studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2020 she won an undergraduate prize from the Academy of American Poets for her piece entitled On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs.\"When she is not writing, reading, or talking about writing, she has movie marathons and makes messy art with her daughter and two sons,\" her biography from the prize reads, as quoted in US media. It seems to have now been removed.Good graduated the same year from the university's College of Arts and Letters with a degree in English.Its president said in a statement that her sudden death was \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation\".\"May Renee's life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,\" Old Dominion University president Brian Hemphill wrote.Several state leaders have said that Good was at the scene of an ICE raid in the south of Minneapolis as a legal observer - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations. Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"not part of anything\" that involved challenging ICE agents.But White House officials, including the president, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been \"stalking and impeding their work\" all day by \"blocking them in\" with her car and \"shouting at them\".Good \"weaponised her vehicle\", Noem told reporters, and then tried to run over one of the officers \"in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism\".The ICE agent feared for his life, Noem said, and \"fired defensive shots\".This account was backed up by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social that \"the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting\".He called her a \"professional agitator\" who \"violently, willfully, and viciously\" ran over an ICE officer.But the city's mayor said the agent who shot Good had acted recklessly.\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bullshit,\" Jacob Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"Good reportedly lived just a few blocks from where she was killed, and the scene is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDavid GrittenWatch: Protests break out in Iran's capital city TehranHuge crowds of protesters have been marching through Iran's capital and other cities, videos show, in what is said to be the largest show of force by opponents of the clerical establishment in years.The peaceful demonstrations in Tehran and the second city of Mashhad on Thursday evening, which were not dispersed by security forces, can be seen in footage verified by BBC Persian.Later, a monitoring group reported a nationwide internet blackout.Protesters can be heard in the footage calling for the overthrow of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the return of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late former shah, who had urged his supporters to take to the streets.It was the 12th consecutive day of unrest that has been sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and has spread to more than 100 cities and towns across all 31 of Iran's provinces, according to human rights groups.The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) has said at least 34 protesters - five of them children - and eight security personnel have been killed, and that 2,270 other protesters have been arrested.Norway-based monitor Iran Human Rights (IHR) has said at least 45 protesters, including eight children, have been killed by security forces.BBC Persian has confirmed the deaths and identities of 22 people, while Iranian authorities have reported the deaths of six security personnel.On Thursday evening, videos posted on social media and verified by BBC Persian showed a large crowd of protesters moving along a major road in Mashhad, in the country's north-east.Chants of \"Long live the shah\" and \"This is the final battle! Pahlavi will return\" can be heard. And at one point, several men are seen climbing on an overpass and removing what appears to be surveillance cameras attached to it.Another video posted online showed a large crowd of protesters walking along a major road in eastern Tehran. In footage sent to BBC Persian from the north of the capital, another large crowd is heard chanting \"This is the final battle! Pahlavi will return\". Elsewhere in the north, protesters were filmed shouting \"Dishonourable\" and \"Don't be afraid, we are all together\" following a clash with security forces. Middle East Images / AFP via Getty ImagesProtests were also reported in several other provinces, including Kermanshah - pictured here on ThursdayOther videos showed protesters chanting \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to Khamenei - in the central city of Isfahan; \"Long live the shah\" in the northern city of Babol, and \"Don't be afraid, we are all together\" in the north-western city of Tabriz.In the western city of Dezful, footage sent to BBC Persian showed a large crowd of protesters and also security personnel appearing to open fire from a central square. The evening protests came not long after Reza Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution and lives in Washington DC, had called on Iranians to \"take to the streets and, as a united front, shout your demands\".In a post on X, Pahlavi said \"millions of Iranians demanded their freedom tonight\", describing the protesters as his \"courageous compatriots\".He thanked US President Donald Trump for holding the \"regime to account\", and called on European leaders to do the same.Pahlavi has also called for protests to continue from 20:00 local time (16:30 GMT) on Friday night.Iranian state media downplayed the scale of Thursday's unrest. In some cases, they denied protests had taken place altogether, posting videos of empty streets.Meanwhile, internet watchdog NetBlocks said its metrics showed that Iran was \"in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout\".\"The incident follows a series of escalating digital censorship measures targeting protests across the country and hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment,\" it warned, referring to previous losses of connectivity in several cities.Earlier in the day, footage from Lomar, a small town in the western province of Ilam, showed a crowd chanting \"Cannons, tanks, fireworks, mullahs must go\" - a reference to the clerical establishment. Another showed people throwing papers into the air outside a bank that appeared to have been broken into.Other videos showed many shuttered shops in a number of predominantly Kurdish cities and towns in Ilam, as well as Kermanshah and Lorestan provinces.It followed a call for a general strike by exiled Kurdish opposition groups in response to the deadly crackdown on protests in the region.At least 17 protesters have been killed by security forces in Ilam, Kermanshah and Lorestan during the unrest, and many of them have been members of the Kurdish or Lor ethnic minorities, according to Kurdish human rights group Hengaw.On Wednesday, there were violent clashes between protesters and security forces in several cities and towns in western Iran, as well as other regions.IHR said it had been the deadliest day of the unrest, with 13 protesters confirmed to have been killed across the country.\"The evidence shows that the scope of crackdown is becoming more violent and more extensive every day,\" said the group's director, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam.Hengaw said two protesters were shot dead by security forces in Khoshk-e Bijar, in the northern province of Gilan, on Wednesday night.Iran's semi-official news agency Fars, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards, reported that three police officers were also killed on Wednesday. It said two were shot dead by armed individuals among a group of \"rioters\" in the south-western town of Lordegan, and the third was stabbed to death \"during efforts to control unrest\" in Malard country, west of Tehran.XIn videos from Mashhad, protesters can be heard chanting \"Long live the shah\"On Thursday, US President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to intervene militarily if Iranian authorities killed protesters.\"I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots - they have lots of riots - if they do it, we are going to hit them very hard,\" he said in an interview with the Hugh Hewitt Show.Separately, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the Iranian economy was \"on the ropes\".While speaking at the Economic Club of Minnesota on Thursday, he added: \"[President Trump] does not want them to harm more of the protesters. This is a tense moment.\" Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian earlier called on security forces to exercise \"utmost restraint\" when handling peaceful protests. \"Any violent or coercive behaviour should be avoided,\" a statement said.Khamenei - who has ultimate power in Iran - said on Saturday that authorities should \"speak with the protesters\" but that \"rioters should be put in their place\".The protests began on 28 December, when shopkeepers took to the streets of Tehran to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.The rial has sunk to a record low over the past year and inflation has soared to 40% as sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme squeeze an economy also weakened by government mismanagement and corruption.University students soon joined the protests and they began spreading to other cities, with crowds frequently heard chanting slogans critical of the clerical establishment.In messages sent to the BBC, via a UK-based activist, a woman in Tehran said despair was driving the protests.\"We're living in limbo,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm hanging in the air with neither wings to migrate nor hope to pursue my goals here. Life here has become unbearable.\"Another said she was protesting because her dreams had been \"stolen\" by the clerical establishment and she wanted it to know that \"we still have a voice to shout, a fist to punch them in the face.\"A woman in the western city of Ilam said she knew of young people from families affiliated with the establishment who were taking part in protests. \"My friend and her three sisters, whose father is a well-known figure in the intelligence services, are joining without their father knowing,\" she said.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.The biggest protests since the Islamic revolution took place in 2009, when millions of Iranians took to the streets of major cities after a disputed presidential election. Dozens of opposition supporters killed and thousands were detained in the ensuing crackdown.",

    "body": "9 hours agoMadeline HalpertMinneapolisEloise Alanna/BBCFlowers have been left at the scene of the shooting in tribute to Renee GoodMinnesota officials say the FBI has blocked their access to an investigation into the fatal shooting of a woman by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent.People have taken to the streets of Minneapolis to protest the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, who died on Wednesday after being shot in her car.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials from involvement in the case, but the US vice-president said the investigation is a federal issue.Officials have offered differing accounts of the incident, with the Trump administration claiming the ICE agent was acting in self defence, while local officials say the woman posed no danger.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed the ICE agent shot Good multiple times because she was trying to run over the officer in her car. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would investigate the incident. Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said the FBI had initially agreed to a joint investigation with state officials but then reversed course and denied the state access to materials and evidence. Without the ability to access all the necessary case materials and evidence, the BCA has \"reluctantly withdrawn\" from the investigation, the BCA's superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.Watch: Politicians divided on Minneapolis shootingSpeaking at a news conference on Thursday, Walz said he was worried the federal government would not be able to carry out an unbiased investigation. \"It feels now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation,\" Walz said. \"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome.\"Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Thursday that the investigation into the shooting was a federal issue, arguing it would go against precedent for a local official to be involved in prosecuting the case. Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard.The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street. At the scene of the crash on Thursday, blood from the shooting could still be seen in the snow. People set up a vigil at the site to honour Good, lining the bank with candles and roses. Hundreds of demonstrators showed up throughout the day, shouting insults at ICE and offering their neighbours coffee on the cold winter day. Susie Hawyard, a minister, said she went to the scene of the shooting as soon as she heard the news to verify \"with my own eyes\" what happened. Eloise Alanna/BBCMembers of the community have been gathering to pay their respects to Good\"I was horrified,\" she said. \"I saw the car, I saw Renee's car, I saw Renee's blood.\" Protesters also gathered at a federal building in Minneapolis early Thursday morning, where they were met with armed officers. The protests remained largely peaceful there, as residents expressed their anger over the killing of Good. \"They cannot get away with killing someone. There has to be consequences for actions,\" said Gavin, one of dozens of people outside the federal building. Those who knew Good said she was a poet and guitarist who had just moved to the city of Minneapolis. Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"probably terrified\" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot. \"She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the daily newspaper. \"She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"Even those who did not know Good said they were touched by her death. \"Renee was everything that was good about our community,\" said Nimco Ahmad, a Somali immigrant who grew up just blocks from the incident. Ahmad said she and others were gathered to help ensure justice would be secured for Good.Eloise Alanna/BBCNimco Ahmad said the shooting has shaken up the welcoming community of MinneapolisThe exclusion of state authorities from the probe into Good's killing is likely to undermine public trust, said Edward Maguire, a criminology professor at Arizona State University. \"From a criminological perspective, jurisdictional claims in cases like this are often less about legal requirements and more about political efforts to control the investigation and shape its outcome,\" he said. But the state could still file criminal charges later against the federal officer who killed Good, said Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.With additional reporting from Grace GoodwinFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

The attack targeting a Jewish festival left 15 people dead, making it one of the deadliest in the country's history.Albanese had previously argued that reforms on gun ownership and hate speech, steps to tackle antisemitism and a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies offered the quickest response.But following weeks of public pressure, he said on Thursday that a royal commission was the best way forward after he had taken \"the time to reflect\" and meet with the Jewish community.\"I've repeatedly said that our government's priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \"It's clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this.\"Since the 14 December attack, the families of the victims, as well as a chorus of public figures, including lawyers, business people and athletes had led an almost daily campaign calling for him to reverse course and launch a royal commission.A royal commission has broad powers to investigate, the ability to summon witnesses and compel agencies to produce documents. It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers.The commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise:investigating the \"nature and prevalence of antisemitism\" and its \"key drivers\" in Australiamaking recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attackmaking any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremismThe prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April.Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that \"this won't be a drawn-out process.\" Previous royal commissions have taken years.\"This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,\" Albanese said.Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were \"serious concerns\" about her appointment, without specifying what they were.Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was \"an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision\".Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: \"It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider.\"He also added that the inquiry was not meant to \"provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East\".\"The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,\" Albanese said.In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme.Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\".He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report.Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism.Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was \"the right one and an important one\". \"It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,\" she said.",

    "body": "4 hours agoWill Grant,Central America correspondentandOlivia IrelandThe Venezuelan government has started releasing detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups, in what officials described as a goodwill gesture.Spain's foreign ministry said five of its nationals had been released. Among them is prominent Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist, Rocío San Miguel, her family confirmed to US media.The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York.The release of political prisoners in Venezuela has been a long-held US demand, especially during moments of heightened repression around elections or protests.Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that \"a significant number\" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed.Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Venezuelan prisons, with only a handful thought to have been released so far. Jorge Rodríguez said the interim government was releasing them in the interest of \"national unity and peaceful coexistence\".Rocío San Miguel, a vocal critic of Maduro and a defence expert, was the first prisoner confirmed to be freed. Her family told the New York Times that she was taken to the Spanish embassy in Caracas.Arrested in 2024, she was accused of being involved in a plot to kill the then-president and faced charges of treason, conspiracy and terrorism. Her arrest shocked human rights activists and, because her whereabouts were unknown, was labelled as potential \"enforced disappearance\" by the UN Human Rights Office.Venezuelan human rights organisations - some of which have members or their founders in jail - welcomed the news with caution.Despite being a key lieutenant of Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez's interim administration has appeared willing to co-operate with the US since it took its leader and made sweeping declarations about the South American nation's future.Watch: BBC reports from outside Venezuela prison \"El Helicoide\" as detainees releasedAbout 50 to 80 prisoners are believed to be held at the notorious El Helicoide prison, which US President Donald Trump announced would be closed following Maduro's capture. The prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents, with reports by human rights groups of torture including beatings and electrocution. The announcement also comes shortly after US President Donald Trump stated that he had \"given orders to close that prison,\" which had become one of the most notorious symbols of political repression in the country.Venezuelan human rights group Provea warned El Helicoide's anticipated closure should not deflect attention from the other detention sites still running across the country. Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies in prison, has repeatedly demanded releases. In a sit-down interview with the Fox News show Hannity, Trump said Machado was expected to come to the US \"next week sometime\". Machado told host Sean Hannity earlier in the week that she wanted to give the US president her Nobel Peace Prize. When asked by Hannity whether Trump would accept the offer, he said \"that would be a great honour\". Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years the government used detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics. Since the widely disputed 2024 election, the opposition claimed legal proceedings against activists, journalists and political adversaries increased. Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government repeatedly denied Venezuela held political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for genuine crimes.

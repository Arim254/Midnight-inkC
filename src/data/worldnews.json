    "body": "From booze to black belts: Virginia's drunk raccoon suspected in karate shop break-inA raccoon that broke into a Virginia store and joyfully drank its way through the liquor aisle is now suspected of a wider crime spree, officials say.A Hanover animal control officer suspects the stripe-tailed mammal also broke into a nearby karate studio and then raided the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for snacks.\"Supposedly, this is the third break-in he's had,\" said Officer Samantha Martin.The raccoon, now nicknamed the \"trashed panda\", was first discovered passed out in the bathroom of the Ashland liquor store two days after Thanksgiving. After sobering up, the unlikely outlaw was released back into the wild.A new study found the masked mammals known for rummaging rubbish bins for easy food, are evolving and getting comfortable around humans.Ms Martin says it's only a matter of time before the masked bandit strikes the shopping centre again.\"This is not the first time he's been in one of the buildings,\" she told the county government's official podcast, Hear in Hanover, on Thursday. \"He was in the karate studio. I think he got into the DMV [and] ate some of their snacks one time,\" she said. She later added that there is a chance the earlier break-ins could have been perpetrated by a different raccoon - but officials have identified him as their prime suspect.Raccoons are known for breaking into peoples garbage cans, leading to the nickname \"trash panda\".The county has been selling shirts with the logo \"trashed panda\" and has raised a whopping $207,000 (£155,000) as of Friday. The money will be used to renovate the shelter, and add to its capacity, Ms Martin said. Officials say the little Kung Fu trash panda was living his best life when he was detained in the liquor store and kept his spirits up even after being placed in the county kennel. \"I just set him in there, [and] let him kinda relax for a few hours. The sun was beating on him so he was feeling good,\" Ms Martin said, adding that he was released about one mile away from the shopping complex. \"He didn't do anything wrong. He was just having a good time.\" The story has gone viral, which Ms Martin says is because it is so \"relatable\".\"Everybody's been there,\" she says. \"Everybody's had a few extra and passed out by the toilet, and hopes somebody can come get you the next morning.\"\"I hope he learned his lesson,\" she said, before adding that there's a good chance he might be found committing another heist soon. \"He'll be back. He's not a dummy.\" ",

    "body": "George WrightandBethany Bell,BerlinGermany has accused Russia of a cyber-attack on air traffic control and attempted electoral interference, and summoned the Russian ambassador. A foreign ministry spokesman said Russian military intelligence was behind a \"cyber-attack against German air traffic control in August 2024\". The spokesman also accused Russia of seeking to influence and destabilise the country's federal election in February this year. The latest accusations come amid heightened concern in Europe over suspected Russian cyber-attacks since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Russia has \"categorically rejected\" the claims, saying their alleged involvement in such incidents was \"absurd\".\"The accusations of Russian state structures' involvement in these incidents and in the activities of hacker groups in general are baseless, unfounded and absurd,\" Russia's embassy in Berlin said in a statement to AFP news agency.The foreign ministry in Germany said that Berlin - in close co-ordination with its European partners - would respond with counter-measures to make Russia \"pay a price for its hybrid actions\".In the last year, both the UK and Romania have accused Russia of meddling in their domestic affairs, including targeting organisations that deliver foreign assistance to Ukraine and presidential elections.The spokesman said the August 2024 cyber-attack on Germany could be attributed to the Fancy Bear Russian hacker group.\"Our intelligence findings prove that the Russian military intelligence service GRU bears responsibility for this attack,\" he added.The ministry spokesman added it was now certain that Moscow had attempted to  \"influence and destabilise both the last federal election and the ongoing internal affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany\" through a disinformation campaign called Storm 1516.The campaign, it said, had focused in part on lead Green Party candidate Robert Habeck and lead CDU candidate Friedrich Merz, who is now chancellor.The German government said security agencies had identified fake videos alleging ballot manipulation as part of a Russian disinformation effort just days before the election.Its air navigation service provider confirmed that its office communication had been hacked in August 2024. It said flights had not been affected.Fancy Bear is said to have previously leaked World Anti-Doping Agency data, and played a key role in the 2016 cyber-attack on the US Democratic National Committee, according to security experts.Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to a major deterioration in relations between Berlin and Moscow.Germany has emerged as one of Ukraine's most vocal supporters, providing military, financial and diplomatic support for Kyiv.Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called strongly for frozen Russian assets to be used to help protect Ukraine.He has also repeatedly accused Russia of cyber warfare against his country.But relations have been strained for years, even before the Russian invasion. In 2019, an ethnic Chechen was killed by a Russian national, Vadim Krasikov, in broad daylight in Berlin's Tiergarten Park. Germany later expelled two Russian diplomats, as prosecutors suspected that he was acting on the orders of Russia's state security agency.While it is yet to respond to the latest allegations, Moscow has previously denied  European allegations of a Russian sabotage or hybrid campaign.",

    "body": "14 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulAFP via Getty ImagesIranian security forces have \"violently arrested\" Nobel Peace Prize winner and women's rights activist Narges Mohammadi, her foundation has said. The Narges Foundation said Ms Mohammadi, 53, was detained in the eastern city of Mashhad, along with other activists. The Nobel Committee said it was \"deeply concerned by today's brutal arrest of Narges Mohammadi\" and called on the authorities \"to immediately clarify Mohammadi's whereabouts, ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\". Iran does not appear to have commented.  Ms Mohammadi was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights. In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from jail for three weeks on medical grounds, after being held in Tehran's notorious Evin prison since 2021. She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences. Her latest arrest reportedly came as she attended a memorial ceremony for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer found dead in his office last week. Norway-based group Iran Human Rights had called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances around his death were \"suspicious\". Several other activists were detained at the ceremony, where it's reported they shouted slogans, including \"death to the dictator\" and \"long live Iran\". Taghi Rahmani, Ms Mohammadi's husband, told BBC Persian: \"They arrested Narges violently. The brother of the lawyer witnessed her arrest at the memorial.\"This act is against human rights laws, and amounts to some kind of revenge. \"This happened in Mashhad today and is concerning because the establishment's crackdown has intensified recently.\"Ms Mohammadi had recently accused the Iranian authorities of intensifying repression since the June ceasefire with Israel. Last week she wrote an article for Time magazine about the Iranian state controlling all aspects of personal or public life. \"Their peace is disrupted by surveillance, censorship, arbitrary arrest, torture, and the constant threat of violence,\" she said. She had also told the Nobel Committee she had received warnings from \"agents of the regime\" through indirect channels and her lawyers. \"The threats conveyed to Ms Mohammadi make it clear that her security is at stake, unless she commits to end all public engagement within Iran, as well as any international advocacy or media appearances in support of democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression,\" the Nobel committee's statement added.Over the past year, she has continued to remain defiant, refusing to wear the mandatory headscarf and meeting fellow activists across the country.Across her lifetime, Mohammadi has been arrested 13 times and been sentenced to more 36 years imprisonment and 154 lashes, according to her foundation.

    "body": "1 hour agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandMatt SpiveyFighting between Thai and Cambodian forces continued early on Saturday hours after US President Donald Trump said the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said he told Trump a ceasefire would only be possible after Cambodia had withdrawn all its forces and removed landmines.He wrote on social media: \"Thailand will continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people. I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke.\" Both sides reported continued bombing and artillery exchanges across the border on Saturday.Cambodia's defence ministry said that Thai fighter jets bombed hotel buildings and a bridge, while Thailand reported several civilians were injured in a Cambodian rocket attack.At least 21 people have died in the renewed fighting and 700,000 have been evacuated on both sides.Trump had claimed earlier in the week that he could stop the fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces that broke out on Monday just by picking up the phone.After speaking to both prime ministers on Friday night he wrote on social media that the two countries had agreed to \"cease shooting effective this evening\" and go back to the agreement they signed in front of the US president in October.\"Both countries are ready for peace,\" he wrote.But in their comments after speaking to the US president, neither side mentioned an imminent ceasefire.Anutin said he told Trump that Thailand was not the aggressor, and that Cambodia must show that it had withdrawn its forces and removed landmines from the border before a ceasefire was possible. \"They must show us first,\" he said.The Cambodian leadership said they must fight on to protect their country's sovereignty.There was no mention of the use of tariffs as leverage to force the two sides to disengage, as happened in July.Thailand has warned the US not to link the conflict to trade.On Saturday Cambodia reported that it had been struck by more Thai air strikes.\"On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs\" on a number of targets, the Cambodian defence ministry said in an X post.\"Thai military aircraft have not stopped bombing yet,\" it said.The Thai military also confirmed that fighting continued.The long-standing border dispute escalated on 24 July, as Cambodia launched a barrage of rockets into Thailand, which responded with air strikes.Both countries have accused each other of initiating the attacks. After days of intense fighting which left dozens dead, the neighbouring South East Asian countries agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This was formalised at a ceremony in Malaysia in October presided over by the US president.However, both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines, which have caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Cambodia says the mines are left over from the civil war in the 1980s.Since then, tensions continued to build.This week, Thailand launched air strikes inside Cambodia after two of its soldiers were injured in a skirmish last Sunday. Cambodia has responded with rocket barrages. The fighting affected six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and six provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.The two countries have been been contesting their 800km land border for more than a century. The border was drawn by French cartographers in 1907, when France was the colonial ruler in Cambodia.",

    "body": "13 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondent Angry French farmers are calling for more protests over the government-backed slaughter of cattle herds affected by so-called Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD).On Thursday there were clashes between riot police and demonstrators in the southern Ariège department, after vets were called in to destroy potentially contaminated cattle at a farm.Elsewhere in the south, farmers have dumped manure outside government buildings and blocked roads. The offices of several environmentalist groups were ransacked in the Charente-Maritime department.LSD is a highly contagious bovine disease which is transmitted mainly by fly-bites.  The symptoms are fever, mucal discharge and nodules on the skin.Though mainly non-fatal, it can badly affect milk-production and the cows are unsaleable. The disease arrived in Europe from Africa about ten years ago. France's first outbreak was in the Alps in June, when an infected herd forced the Tour de France cycle race to cut short one of its stages.The government's policy of slaughtering entire herds where a single animal has been infected has run up against bitter opposition from two of the three main farmers' unions.Conféderation Rurale and Conféderation Paysanne say the policy is being brutally applied, and is in any case unnecessary because a combination of selective culling and vaccination would suffice.But most vets disagree. \"Right now we are unable to tell the difference between a healthy animal and a symptomless animal carrying the virus. That is the only reason we have to carry out these whole-herd slaughters,\" said Stephanie Philizot who heads the SNGTV vets' union.Since June there have been around 110 outbreaks of LSD in France, originally in the east but now increasingly in the south-west. Ministry officials blame the illegal movement of cattle from affected zones. Around 3,000 animals have been slaughtered.The French government is worried the protests could snowball into a wider movement among a farming population that feels itself under growing threat from the imposition of EU norms and competition from abroad.A big protest is planned in Brussels next week during the summit of EU leaders.  Several French farming sectors are in deep crisis, from wine-growers hit by falling consumption to poultry farmers hit by avian flu.There is also widespread opposition to the impending signature of an EU free-trade agreement with South American countries, which farmers fear will open France to more cheap food imports, much of it produced under looser environmental and sanitary constraints.",

    "body": "8 hours agoVitaly ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringWarehouses supplying the vast majority of Ukraine's pharmacies have been destroyed in a series of Russian attacks over recent months.Medical supplies worth about $200m (£145m) were destroyed in just two strikes in December and October.A large warehouse storing medicines in the city of Dnipro was destroyed in a Russian air strike on 6 December. As a result, about $110m worth of medicines were destroyed - estimated at up to 30% of Ukraine's monthly supply.\"It was a missile and drone strike against our facility. The missiles flew past, but the drones hit it,\" said Dmytro Babenko, acting director-general of pharmaceutical distributor BADM.\"They caused a fire which unfortunately proved impossible to contain and the whole facility was destroyed.\"BADM is one of two companies that supply about 85% of Ukrainian pharmacies in roughly equal shares.The other company is Optima Pharm, whose warehouses have been hit three times this year - on 28 August, 25 October and 15 November.The October attack destroyed its main storage facility in Kyiv, and cost the company more than $100m, says Optima Pharm's chief financial officer Artem Suprun.Russia denies hitting civilian targets, but when the Optima Pharm warehouse was hit in October, the defence ministry in Moscow said only that it had targeted a factory producing drones.On the day BADM's warehouse was destroyed, Russia said it had hit \"a warehouse storing military equipment\" as well as energy and transport infrastructure.Such attacks significantly complicate the treatment of sick and wounded in Ukraine,   after almost four years of Russia's full-scale war.The International Rescue Committee (IRC), an NGO that had been using the warehouse in Dnipro, says it lost $195,000 worth of medication and supplies, which could have served 30,000 people in need.\"When I arrived at the site I was devastated, the scene was simply awful. All of this medicine could have served people for years, and in a single moment it was all lost,\" says the IRC's Andriy Moskalenko.The IRC said the Dnipro facility had served \"as a critical hub for hospitals, healthcare providers, pharmacies and humanitarian actors\".Mr Babenko from BADM said the Russian attack had destroyed \"vitally important medicines\" that had been imported and are not produced in Ukraine.\"It's a pretty complicated situation,\" he told the BBC.But he is hopeful that the attack will not leave Ukrainians without medicines.\"There won't be significant shortages, possibly only of certain types of goods. We're hoping to restore all supplies in a month or a month-and-a-half,\" Mr Babenko said.Ukrainian authorities accuse Russia of deliberately targeting hospitals, ambulances, medics and rescue workers, claims Moscow has denied. According to the government in Kyiv, more than 2,500 medical institutions have been damaged or destroyed, and more than 500 civilian doctors, nurses and other medical workers killed.Earlier this month, the World Health Organization said it had recorded 2,763 attacks on Ukraine's healthcare system since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, and it said that in 2025 there had been a 12% increase in attacks from the previous year.",

    "body": "An eyebrow tip and McDonald's footage: Takeaways from Luigi Mangione's evidence hearing 7 hours agoMadeline HalpertGetty ImagesMr Mangione has watched as the court plays body camera footage from the day of his arrestLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a case that sparked national attention, watched as new testimony and never-before-seen footage from the day of his arrest in a McDonald's was unveiled during a hearing this week.Mr Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges related to the 2024 murder of Mr Thompson, a father of two, as well as federal counts that carry the possibility of the death penalty.The pre-trial hearing is focused on the defence's attempts to keep certain evidence out of the trial, which has not been scheduled yet, including items found in his backpack during his arrest and statements he made to officers.During the first two weeks of the hearing, supporters of Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family and Ivy League graduate - filled the back rows of the Manhattan criminal courtroom, some wearing a pin portraying him as a saint-like figure.Prosecutors and Mr Mangione's legal team are expected to question over a dozen witnesses from the day of his arrest, including the employees who spotted him and the police who arrested him.Here is a look at some of the key pieces of evidence discussed that offer a window into Mr Mangione's trial.An eyebrow giveawayThe pre-trial hearing has centred on the small-town McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where officers were shocked to find the high-profile suspect days after Mr Thompson was fatally shot - and hours from the busy Midtown Manhattan crime scene.Witnesses suggested the arrest may never have occurred there if not for one of  Mr Mangione's key features: his eyebrows.During the first day of the hearing, prosecutors played a call to police from a McDonald's employee about a tip from a customer in the restaurant.The employee said the customer thought a patron looked like the suspect in the United Healthcare CEO shooting. The patron was well covered, wearing a black hoodie, a medical mask and a tan beanie. But one key detail stuck out.\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".New York County District Attorney's OfficeProsecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"'Proposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald'sDozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.A fake name leads to an arrestWatch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald'sIn the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.Bullets, a journal and cash: a peak into Mr Mangione's backpackThe pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.New York County District Attorney's OfficeEvidence found during Mr Mangione's arrestVideo played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.The hearing is expected to continue into next week.",

    "body": "1 day agoYang TianReutersNemo made history by becoming the first non-binary performer to win Eurovision in 2024The winner of last year's Eurovision Song Contest, Nemo, has said they are returning their trophy in protest over Israel's continued participation in the event.The 26-year-old Swiss singer said there was a \"clear conflict\" between Israel's involvement in the competition and the ideals of \"unity, inclusion and dignity\" the contest says it stands for.Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said Eurovision was \"saddened\" by the decision and respected Nemo's views.Israel's presence at Eurovision has been an increasing source of tension, because of the war in Gaza and a voting controversy during this year's event.Five countries - Iceland, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands - have announced they will boycott next year's event because Israel has been allowed to compete.Israel has previously called the decision to keep it in the contest a \"victory\" over critics who had tried to silence it and spread hatred.Nemo became the first non-binary performer to lift the Eurovision trophy with their song The Code, which is about the path to realising they were non-binary.After the win, Nemo told the BBC about the challenges they faced during the contest and their feeling that organisers had not done enough to support participants caught up in the row over Israel's inclusion in 2024.\"I felt very alone. I really hope they have things in place for the next year,\" Nemo said at the time. It prompted a series of new measures to be introduced to protect the mental well-being of Eurovision's artists and staff.In a statement posted to Instagram on Thursday, Nemo said they felt the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) decision to allow Israel to still take part in the event no longer aligned with its core values.\"Israel's continued participation, during what the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry has concluded to be a genocide, shows a clear conflict between those ideals and the decision made by the EBU,\" they said, referring to a report released in September.\"Even though I am immensely grateful for the community around this contest and everything this experience has taught me both as a person and artist, today I no longer feel this trophy belongs on my shelf.\"Nemo also posted a video of them placing the trophy in a cardboard box, saying it will be sent back to the EBU's headquarters in Geneva.In a statement sent to BBC News, Martin Green said: \"We're saddened that Nemo wishes to return their trophy which they deservedly won in 2024. \"We respect the deeply held views Nemo has expressed and they will always remain a valued part of the Eurovision family\"EPANemo performing at the 2024 Eurovision in Malmo, SwedenThe boycotts and protests over Israel's inclusion have been the biggest crisis Eurovision has ever seen.This year's competition also had a voting controversy and allegations that Israel's government tried to influence the public vote.This prompted some competition rules to be changed and tightened, after which a \"large majority\" of members agreed there was no need for a further vote on participation and that Eurovision 2026 could proceed as planned, the EBU has said.Israel's President Isaac Herzog has praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it an \"appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation\".Addressing the boycotts, Nemo insisted that their decision to hand back the trophy was not about \"individuals or artists\", but rather what they believed was the use of Eurovision to \"soften the image of a state accused of severe wrongdoing\".\"When entire countries withdraw, it should be clear that something is deeply wrong,\" they added.\"If the values we celebrate on stage aren't lived off stage then even the most beautiful songs become meaningless.\"The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,370 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Next year's Eurovision is due to take place in Vienna, for what is supposed to be a celebratory 70th anniversary edition of the contest.",

    "body": "A large fire broke out on a Turkish car ferry anchored at the Ukrainian port city of Odesa after it was hit in a strike on Friday.The company that operates the Cenk T confirmed the attack occurred at 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT) shortly after it docked at the Chornomorsk port.Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky has blamed the strike on Russia, which has not commented.The attack came hours after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Russian President Vladimir Putin that a limited ceasefire for energy facilities and ports could be beneficial. Russia has resisted all calls for a ceasefire.Moscow has threatened to cut \"Ukraine off from the sea\" in response to Kyiv's maritime drone attacks on Russia's \"shadow fleet\" tankers thought to be used to export oil - and a main source for funding the ongoing war.Cenk Denizcilik, the company that owns the cargo ship that operates on the Karasu-Odesa route across the Black Sea, said on Friday that it had been carrying \"essential food supplies\" when it was hit shortly after anchoring at the Ukrainian port city.Emergency response measures were immediately activated with the vessel's crew, port fire brigade and assisting tugboats after a fire broke out on the forward section of the ship, the company's statement added.\"At this stage, there are no reports of casualties or injuries among the crew,\" it said.Video footage of the attack's aftermath, which was shared on Zelensky's Telegram account, shows crews attempting to extinguish a large blaze on the vessel.  While condemning a series of missile attacks that Russia had carried out on the Odesa region the night before, the Ukrainian leader blamed Moscow for targeting the civilian Turkish ship, saying it \"could not have any military meaning\".Turkey's foreign ministry said an agreement should be reached that would guarantee \"the security of shipping and suspending attacks against energy and port infrastructure in order to prevent escalation in the Black Sea\". \"We once again underline the importance of urgently ending the war between Russia and Ukraine,\" the ministry said.Turkey has sought to maintain relations with the two warring countries since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. It also controls the Bosphorus Strait, which is a key passage for transporting Ukrainian grain and Russian oil out to the Mediterranean. Russia carried out a second round of strikes on Odesa later in the evening which damaged the port infrastructure facility, according to the region's head of administration.\"[This] emphasises the deliberate nature of enemy strikes on the civilian infrastructure of the region,\" Oleg Kiper wrote in a Telegram post.Friday's strikes knocked out electricity for thousands of homes in Odesa.This comes as US President Donald Trump appears to have grown frustrated by the slow progress his administration is making in securing a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia.Despite Washington's recent diplomatic push, Kyiv and Moscow have rejected key parts of the Trump administration's proposal.While Ukraine is adamant that there should be security guarantees from the US and Europe in place before agreeing to an end to the war, Russia is continuing to demand territorial concessions - which Kyiv has resisted.Russia has been making slow gains on the ground recently.But claims it is in control of key hubs, such as the key town of Pokrovsk - a strategic point on a big road and rail artery in the eastern  Donetsk region - are being denied by the Ukrainians.And in a show of defiance on Friday, President Zelensky posted a video of himself in  Kupyansk - which Moscow claimed to have captured last month.

    "body": "14 hours agoTesfalem Araia,BBC TigrinyaandHanna Temuari,BBC Africa, Addis AbabaEritrea has withdrawn from East African regional bloc Igad, accusing the organisation of \"becoming a tool against\" countries like itself.In a statement on Friday, Eritrea's foreign ministry said Igad had strayed from its founding principles and failed to contribute to regional stability.The withdrawal comes amid a fierce war of words between Eritrea and neighbouring Ethiopia, leading to fears of renewed armed conflict.In response to Eritrea's statement, Igad (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) said the country had not made any \"tangible proposals\" or engaged with reforms.Igad was established to promote regional stability and food security in East Africa, and also includes Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, and Djibouti.The government in Eritrea's capital, Asmara, has long accused Igad of siding with Ethiopia in regional disputes.Eritrea previously left the bloc in 2007, during its border dispute with Ethiopia. It only rejoined in 2023.\"Eritrea finds itself compelled to withdraw its membership from an organisation that has forfeited its legal mandate and authority; offering no discernible strategic benefit to all its constituencies,\" Eritrea's foreign ministry said on Friday.In its response, Igad said that since the country returned to the bloc it had not \"participated in IGAD meetings, programmes, or activities\".The withdrawal comes as tensions have been increasing between Eritrea and Ethiopia, two countries that have a long history of deadly conflict.Since 2023, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been demanding access to the Red Sea through Eritrea, resulting in a furious response from Asmara.After a decades-long battle for independence, Eritrea officially seceded from Ethiopia in 1993, leaving the latter landlocked.In calling for sea access, Abiy and other senior Ethiopian officials have gone as far as questioning Addis Abba's recognition of Eritrean independence.Abiy won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for making peace with Eritrea's strongman President Isaias Afewerki, after a two-decade long border dispute that sparked a war in which more than 100,000 people died.During this conflict, Eritrea was accused of destabilising the region by interfering in the internal affairs of Igad member countries, an allegation Asmara always denied.Instead, Eritrea accused its neighbours of siding with Western powers to destabilise it.At the instigation of Addis Ababa, Igad demanded the African Union and UN Security Council impose sanctions on Eritrea.Eritrea cut diplomatic ties with Djibouti, which hosts the Igad headquarters, following a 2009 border dispute between the two countries.Former Ethiopian Foreign Minister Workneh Gebyehu is currently the head of Igad, adding to Asmara's suspicion of the organisation.Igad has been criticised by many for failing to bring stability and regional integration to the Horn of Africa, a region beset by civil wars, terrorism and intra-state confrontations.",

    "body": "As Trump targets Venezuela, its allies Russia and China show little signs of support8 hours agoNorberto ParedesBBC News MundoGetty ImagesVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro could be forgiven for wondering who his true friends are. Once rock solid, his reliance on his two main allies - China and Russia - now appears increasingly uncertain.For years, both countries supported Venezuela's socialist-led government politically, financially and militarily - a relationship that began under former President Hugo Chávez, Maduro's mentor and predecessor.But experts say that backing now seems to be largely symbolic, with statements being given in support rather than concrete military or financial aid.This shift comes as the US has deployed air and naval forces - including a nuclear-powered submarine, spy planes and 15,000 troops - to the Caribbean.The US has conducted strikes on boats in the region that it alleges are smuggling drugs, killing more than 80 people, and in recent days, it seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.The Trump administration has said the military build-up and strikes are targeting drug trafficking, and the tanker had been sanctioned. But many experts - and Maduro himself - believe Washington's real goal is regime change.So at the Venezuelan president's hour of greatest need, what has changed?Prof Fernando Reyes Matta, director of the Centre for China Studies at Andrés Bello University in Chile, argues that Venezuela has become a far lower priority for both Beijing and Moscow, especially since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House.\"There is no reason today for either Russia or China to go all-in defending Venezuela given their other problems, such as Russia and its war in Ukraine, and China trying to coexist internationally with President Trump,\" he says.Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has poured enormous resources into the conflict, straining both its finances and its military. It has also faced sweeping Western sanctions.This leaves fewer resources for allies that previously benefited from Kremlin support, says Prof Vladimir Rouvinski, the director of the Laboratory of Politics and International Relations (PoInt) at Icesi University in Colombia.Syria and Iran, Moscow's long-standing allies in the Middle East, have faced a similar fate in recent times.\"Russia will [not] risk receiving more sanctions than it already has, [and] China will not risk getting more tariffs imposed on it for defending Maduro,\" Prof Rouvinski explains.Maduro reportedly asked China and Russia for military assistance at the end of October, according to The Washington Post.The Kremlin's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said \"we support Venezuela, as it supports us\", while urging the Trump administration to avoid escalating the crisis, Russian media reported. And in the wake of the American seizure of the oil tanker, the Kremlin said Putin had called Maduro to affirm his support.But so far, Moscow has not provided any material assistance.Getty ImagesPutin and Maduro met in Moscow in May 2025. Russia has provided Venezuela with military support for yearsLike Moscow, Beijing has shown no sign it would militarily defend Venezuela, instead condemning what it calls \"external interference\" and urging restraint.Experts say China defending Maduro could jeopardise recent diplomatic gains between Beijing and Washington, while offering little beyond ideological alignment.US–China relations have been particularly tense since Trump imposed tariffs on multiple countries. But a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea in late October - described as positive by both sides - opened the door to new agreements and lower tariffs on certain products.According to experts, Venezuela's economic collapse and the deterioration of its oil industry have further discouraged Chinese support. Beijing has reduced new lending in recent years and is now focused mainly on recovering past loans.\"I think China is willing to negotiate with any government that eventually replaces Maduro, and believes that supporting Maduro too strongly now could bring negative consequences when the regime falls,\" says Prof Rouvinski.Getty ImagesVenezuela has purchased hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Chinese military equipment since 2005Prof Reyes Matta does not think \"either of the two countries is willing to support a regime that has so little internal backing\".\"Moreover, both Russia and China know that the last presidential election had very evident fraudulent characteristics.\"The July 2024 election was marred by serious allegations of fraud. The National Electoral Council (CNE), dominated by government allies, proclaimed Maduro the winner but provided no detailed results, unlike in previous elections.The opposition - led by this year's Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado - released electoral records suggesting the opposition candidate Edmundo González won.\"This time, Maduro is completely alone,\" says Prof Rouvinski, who believes Maduro's time is \"running out\". \"Russia and China may continue criticising US intervention, but they are not willing to go any further. The support he had in the past is no longer there in real terms, beyond certain rhetorical statements.\"Additional reporting by BBC Global Journalism ",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy will travel to Germany this weekend to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders for the latest round of high-level talks on ending the war.Steve Witkoff, who has been leading White House attempts to mediate between Ukraine and Russia, will discuss the latest version of the proposed peace agreement in Berlin.The Trump administration is pushing for a deal to be in place by Christmas and has held several rounds of talks with Ukrainian and Russian representatives in recent weeks, though there has been little sign a breakthrough is imminent. It has not yet been confirmed which European leaders will attend the Berlin talks.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported details of the meeting, said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would all take part. Confirmation of the Witkoff-Zelensky meeting comes days after Ukraine gave the US its revised version of a 20-point peace plan, the latest iteration of a proposal which first emerged in late November and has triggered a flurry of diplomatic activity.The fate of territory in eastern Ukraine remains one of the most intractable topics in the negotiations, with Kyiv refusing to cede land which has been illegally occupied, and Moscow repeating its intention to take the Donbas region in full by force unless Ukraine withdraws.Zelensky has reacted sceptically to the White House's latest proposal on resolving the territorial question, which is for Ukraine's army to pull out of the region and for it to be turned into a \"special economic zone\".The Ukrainian president told reporters that under the US-proposed terms, the Kremlin would undertake not to advance into the areas vacated by Ukraine's forces, with the land between Russian-controlled parts of the Donbas and Ukraine's defensive lines effectively turned into a demilitarised zone.The proposal, seemingly an attempt to resolve the question of legal ownership by creating a new status for the land, has been publicly questioned by Zelensky, who said: \"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\"Ukraine and allies in Europe have said publicly that the US-led talks have been fruitful, and have hailed progress on securing amendments to a plan which was widely viewed as favouring Russia when it first emerged. But there have been signs in recent weeks that Trump is losing patience with Zelensky and his backers on the continent.In a scathing interview with Politico earlier this week, the US president labelled European leaders \"weak\" and renewed his calls for Ukraine to hold elections.Zelensky said elections could be held within 90 days if the US and Europe provided the necessary security. Elections have been suspended since martial law was declared when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.As the White House's diplomatic push continues, attention in Europe is focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. The Ukrainian government faces a stark financial situation: it needs to find an extra €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) over the next two years.On Friday, European Union governments agreed to indefinitely freeze around €210bn (£185bn; $247) worth of Russian assets held in Europe. It is hoped that agreement paves the way for the funds to be loaned back to Ukraine if a deal can be reached at an EU summit next week, providing Kyiv with financial help for its military and efforts to rebuild parts of the country left devastated after nearly four years of all-out war.That move has been condemned as theft by the Kremlin, and Russia's central bank has said it will sue Euroclear, a Belgian bank where the vast majority of Russian assets frozen after the invasion are held.Officials were still negotiating the exact structure of a deal to repurpose the Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine, with the Belgian government being particularly sceptical due to its particular legal exposure as the main holder. Elsewhere, it was reported that the latest version of the peace plan being circulated envisions Ukraine rapidly joining the European Union.The Financial Times said Brussels backed Ukraine's swift accession to the bloc, an idea proposed by Ukraine in the latest draft it has given to Washington.Ukraine formally applied to join the EU days after the 2022 invasion but despite promises of an accelerated process is still several years away from becoming a member.Under the plan, Ukraine would become a member as soon as January 2027, AFP reported, citing an unnamed senior official. It was unclear whether Washington had approved that element of the draft.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBrandon DrenonHouse Oversight CommitteeUS President Donald Trump was among several prominent figures featured in the images released on Friday Democratic US lawmakers have released two new batches of photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, revealing details of the convicted paedophile's home and ties to the rich and powerful.US President Donald Trump, former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon are among the high-profile figures featured in the photos. The images, many of which have been seen before, do not imply wrongdoing.The nearly 100 photos released by members of the House Oversight Committee on Friday are some of more than 95,000 images obtained via subpoena, the Democrats said.The justice department is separately approaching a deadline next week to publish all Epstein-related documents.Watch: Massie and Garcia on latest photos from Epstein estateIn the first batch of photos released on Friday by lawmakers, Epstein is seen with multiple high-profile figures, none of whom have yet commented. Many of them have previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Trump appeared in three of the images released on Friday. One image showed him standing next to a woman whose face has been redacted.Another showed Trump standing next to Epstein while talking to model Ingrid Seynhaeve at a 1997 Victoria's Secret party in New York – an image that was already publicly available.A third photo showed Trump smiling with several women, whose faces have also been redacted, flanked on either side of him.An additional photo showed an illustrated likeness of the president on red packets next to a sign that reads: \"Trump Condom\".The White House called the release a \"Democrat hoax\" against Trump that has been \"repeatedly debunked\". Trump had for months argued the Epstein saga was a distraction orchestrated by his critics to take attention away from his administration's accomplishments.House Oversight CommitteeHouse Oversight CommitteeFriday's files also include private images of Epstein, including one of him in a bathtub and another that appears to show sexual toys. They also show him with several other prominent people including former President Bill Clinton and tech billionaire Bill Gates.One photo featuring Clinton shows him standing next to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating the disgraced financier's abuse.Two other people the BBC has yet to identify are also in the image, which appeared to have been signed by Clinton.Clinton has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. In 2019, a spokesperson said he \"knows nothing about the terrible crimes\" Epstein pleaded guilty to.One image included in Friday's batch was a cropped section of a picture originally taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, which showed King Charles in conversation with Microsoft founder Gates at a London summit.The image contained in Epstein's collection was cropped to show only Andrew and Gates.Andrew, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein, was stripped of his \"prince\" title and left his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, earlier this year. He has denied any wrongdoing.House Oversight CommitteeThe cropped section of the image, showing Bill Gates and Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorGetty ImagesThe original image, taken by a photographer working for Getty ImagesFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon is also seen in some of the images. In one, he is shown speaking with Epstein at a desk, and in another, standing beside him in front of a mirror.A third image shows him speaking with filmmaker Woody Allen.Other prominent figures who appear in the images include US economist Larry Summers, lawyer Alan Dershowitz and entrepreneur Richard Branson. Not all the images show those individuals in the company of Epstein.No additional context or details were included, so it is not clear when, why or where many of the photos were taken or by whom, including images from what appear to be Epstein's estate in the US Virgin Islands, showing multiple rooms - including one with a dental chair surrounded by sculptures of moustached men on the walls, a scene which featured in a previous release of Epstein files.There is an image of an orange pumpkin with a blonde wig that has been carved in the likeness of Trump. Above it, a sign reads: \"Trumpkin. Make Halloween Great Again.\"House Oversight CommitteeRepublicans, who are in the majority on the House Oversight Committee, have accused Democrats of \"cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump\".In a statement, Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the congressional committee, said: \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"\"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW,\" he added.House Oversight CommitteeEpstein's connection to multiple high-profile figures, along with various unanswered questions about the case, and his 2019 suicide in a Manhattan jail as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, has fuelled online conspiracies and demands for greater transparency around the investigations into the billionaire financier.Following months of pressure from across the political spectrum, the justice department has until 19 December to release all documents related to the Epstein case as required by a bill passed nearly unanimously by Congress and signed by Trump in November.That upcoming deadline is separate from the congressional investigation into the Epstein case.Friday's publications mark the second time in a month that Democrats on the committee have published new images from its inquiry into Epstein.They originally released 19 images on Friday morning before publishing another nearly 80 later in the day, saying in a statement: \"In the interest of transparency, we will continue to release photos from the Epstein estate.\"House Oversight CommitteeTrump was asked about the new photos on Friday evening and told reporters that a lot of people knew and were photographed with Epstein, calling the release \"no big deal\".Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1990s, but according to the president, the pair fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. The White House has also previously said that Trump booted him from his Florida resort for \"being a creep\".Watch: \"I know nothing about it\", says Trump on recent Epstein photos released",

    "body": "1 day agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemAnadolu via Getty ImagesSearch and rescue groups attended a two storey building collapse following heavy rainfall in Beit Lahia on FridayA steady stream of water trickles through openings in the tent Ghadir al-Adham shares with her husband and six children in Gaza City. Her family is still displaced after the war and waiting for reconstruction to begin.\"Here we are, living a life of humiliation,\" she told the BBC. \"We want caravans. We want our homes rebuilt. We long for concrete to keep us warm. Every day I sit and cry for my children.\"Two months into an American-imposed ceasefire, Gaza is stuck in the first phase of Donald Trump's peace plan - its territory divided between the warring parties, its people still displaced and surrounded by rubble.Heavy rain has deluged camps and led several buildings to collapse, as a powerful winter storm sweeps through the Strip. More than 800,000 Gazans are at risk from flooding, the UN says.Ghadir al-Adham is longing to move her children into a solid homeSticking pointPlans for new homes - and new government - lie frozen in the next stage of US President Donald Trump's peace deal, as the search continues for Israel's last missing hostage, Ran Gvili.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has insisted Hamas must return all Israel's hostages – living and dead – before the two sides move on to the next, more difficult, stage of the peace deal.But several searches of Gaza's rubble have so far shown no sign of him. Mr Gvili was captured during the 7 October Hamas attacks - a police officer, recovering from a broken shoulder, who went to defend nearby kibbutz Alumim.HandoutYellow flags have been hung for Ran Gvili near his home in southern IsraelHis parents, Talik and Itzik, were told last year he had not survived.The road to their home in Meitar, in southern Israel, is lined with banners paying tribute to him, the yellow flags of remembrance for Israel's hostages fluttering alongside.\"They stole our kid, they stole him,\" his mother Talik told me.\"They know where he is,\" Itzik said. \"They just try to hide or keep him. They're play[ing] with us.\"They believe Hamas wants to keep their son as an insurance policy against future negotiations, after returning all the other hostages, both living and dead.Itzik Gvili (right) accuses Hamas of trying to hide his sonIn response, a Hamas official told the BBC their allegations were untrue, and that Israel was trying to avoid implementing the agreement.But with no sign of Ran's body, and pressure from Washington growing, his parents say they are counting on Israel's leaders not to move forward before their son is found.\"Everyone in Israel['s] government says to us, 'No, we don't move to the second level until Ran comes back.' This is their promise,\" Talik said.Many in Israel believe it would be politically difficult for Netanyahu to carry out the next steps in the deal, including withdrawing Israeli forces further back towards Gaza's perimeter, if even one hostage is still missing in Gaza.Time 'running out'Both Israel and Hamas face difficult concessions in the next stage of the deal.  For Hamas, it means handing over weapons and power. For Israel, handing over security to an international stabilisation force.And this is also why leaders on both sides may be hesitating, says retired General Israel Ziv, a former head of Israel's military Operations Directorate.\"Israel and Hamas are sharing the same interests not to move so fast into the second stage,\" he told me. \"Hamas doesn't want to lose control, and the Israeli side for political reasons also prefer to stay in Gaza, as nobody wants to explain to their base that they have to withdraw.\"He says Trump is the only one who can force the two sides forward, and that time is running out.\"By waiting I think we might miss the opportunity because Hamas is reorganising and [its] strength is coming back,\" he explained. \"We have to take a deep breath and go forward with that plan, because staying in the situation as it is, it's the worst-case scenario.\"Disarming Hamas – in a way both sides will accept – is seen as the first major hurdle.  Without that, no foreign countries are likely to commit troops to secure the Strip, and no reconstruction is likely to begin in Hamas-controlled areas.Earlier this week, Netanyahu suggested he was sceptical that foreign nations could complete the task in place of Israel.\"Our friends in America want to try to establish an international force that will do the job,\" he said. \"We know that there are certain tasks that this force can do. I don't want to go into detail, they can't do everything, and maybe they can't do the main thing, but we'll see.\"Trump eager to move fastGaza is currently divided in two by the \"yellow line\" marking the limits of Israeli forces under the first stage of the ceasefire deal.Israel's military chief of staff recently referred to it as a \"new border line\", sparking accusations that Israel was signalling an intention to remain there long term.Key issues, including how to disarm Hamas, are due to be discussed at a meeting between Netanyahu and Trump in Florida later this month.The US president – who has already brokered a ceasefire in Gaza and pushed his peace plan through the UN Security Council – has been outspoken about his desire to move the process forward.He told journalists this week that he would announce the membership of a newly created Board of Peace for Gaza early next year. \"It will be one of the most legendary boards ever… Everybody wants to be on it,\" he said.Getty ImagesThe floods make it hard for Gazans to keep children dryThere are also widespread reports that, under pressure from Washington, Israel is beginning work to clear rubble, in preparation for a new temporary housing project in the Israeli-held area of Rafah, in the south of the Strip.The new housing could reportedly provide shelter for tens of thousands of Gazans, on condition that they are willing to cross into Israeli-held areas, and submit to checks for any links to Hamas.Some see it as part of a plan to draw Gazans across into Israeli-held areas, in order to isolate Hamas. A small number of people have already crossed into these areas, to camps set up by armed groups supported by Israel there.But many Gazans – even those who want to replace Hamas – say they refuse to live under Israeli control.It's a glimpse of an alternative future for Gaza, if this second stage of Trump's plan fails; a future where Gaza, already divided, becomes more divided still.",

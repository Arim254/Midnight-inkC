    "body": "2 hours agoLaura GozziARNAUD FINISTRE/AFPFrédéric Péchier faces a minimum of 22 years behind barsA former anaesthetist has been jailed for life for intentionally poisoning 30 patients, including 12 who died.A court in the city of Besançon in eastern France found Frédéric Péchier guilty of contaminating infusion bags with substances that caused cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging.His youngest victim, a four-year-old child, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. His first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. \"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.",

    "body": "Dan Bongino has said he will leave his role as the FBI's deputy director in January.In a post on X, he thanked President Donald Trump, as well as the director of the FBI and the US attorney general \"for the opportunity to serve with purpose\". Bongino did not say in his post why he was stepping down.Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said the former podcast host \"did a great job\" in office, and \"wants to go back to his show\".Bongino, who was appointed to the role by Trump in February, built a large following through his podcast and other media appearances. He was previously a New York City police officer and a US Secret Service agent assigned to protect Barack Obama, the former president.Bongino, a staunch Trump ally, was considered a surprise pick for the role –  which had previously been held by career agents – because he had no prior experience with the agency.The FBI Agents Association, which represents around 14,000 current and former agents, had opposed his appointment to the position.Announcing his decision to step down in Wednesday's social media post, Bongino wrote: \"I will be leaving my position with the FBI in January. I want to thank President Trump, AG [Pam] Bondi, and Director [Kash] Patel for the opportunity to serve with purpose.\"Most importantly, I want to thank you, my fellow Americans, for the privilege to serve you. God bless America, and all those who defend Her.\"Before joining the agency, Bongino had echoed disinformation and conspiracy theories about Trump's false claim that he won the 2020 election, and about the 6 January 2021 pipe bomb investigation. Bongino had previously called the pipe bomb case an \"inside job\". After taking office he pushed to make the investigation, which Attorney General Bondi said had \"languished\", a priority for the FBI.Earlier this month, a man with no known ties to the government was arrested, nearly six years after the pipe bombs were discovered outside the national headquarters for the Republican and Democratic parties. FBI Director Patel, in a social media post on Wednesday praising Bongino's tenure, said he had \"served as the people's voice for transparency, and delivered major breakthroughs in long unsolved cases like the pipe bomb investigation\".\"He not only completed his mission - he far exceeded it,\" Patel wrote.Bongino also appeared to change his mind about the death of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein once he became a leader at the FBI.As a commentator, he had questioned whether Epstein took his own life in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial. Then, in May, Bongino said: \"I have seen the whole file. He killed himself\".In July, the US justice department and FBI released a memo that said Epstein did take his own life, and did not have a \"client list\".The memo frustrated many of Trump's supporters, who echoed the Epstein conspiracy theories and rejected the justice department's findings.According to the BBC's media partner CBS News, the memo led to a contentious meeting between him and Bondi.Bondi, who oversees the FBI, wrote in a brief post on X on Wednesday that \"Americans are safer\" because of Bongino's FBI service.",

    "body": "The Academy Awards will begin streaming exclusively on YouTube in 2029, the latest big change in Hollywood. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made the announcement on Wednesday, saying that it signed a multi-year deal that will give YouTube the exclusive global rights to the Oscars until 2033. The Oscars, which is planned for 15 March, has aired for a half a century on ABC. Starting in 2029, the show will be available live and for free on YouTube. It's another big shakeup in Hollywood, which is dealing with studio sales and mergers, along with steep production cuts.\"The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible - which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community,\" Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor said in a statement. Over decades, viewership of the awards show has declined, though there was a slight uptick in 2025, with a significant number of younger viewers tuning in from cell phones and computers. In a statement, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan called the Oscars \"one of our essential cultural institutions\" and said that partnering with the Academy would \"inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy\". ABC, which has streamed the awards since 1976, said that it was looking forward \"to the next three telecasts\" it will still host.The move comes as Warner Bros Discovery on Wednesday recommended its shareholders reject a hostile takeover bid from Paramount Skydance for a rival bid from streaming giant Netflix. Both options were seen as unfavourable for an industry that has seen drastic cuts over the past several years. Like major studios, cable networks have faced issues as the public has opted for streaming services instead. YouTube winning rights to the Academy Awards further suggests that reliance on streaming sites will continue.",

    "body": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his government will crack down on hate speech following Sunday's deadly shooting at Bondi Beach that targeted a Jewish festival.Fifteen people were killed when two gunmen opened fire at an event to mark the first day of Hanukkah.New laws will target \"those who spread hate, division and radicalisation\", Albanese told reporters in Canberra. The home affairs minister will also be given new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate and a new taskforce will be set up to ensure the education system \"prevents, tackles and properly responds to antisemitism\".The new laws will also include penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence, a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\", and the introduction of \"hate\" as an aggravating factor in sentencing crimes for online threats and harassment.\"Every Jewish Australian has the right to feel safe, valued and respected for the contribution that they make to our great nation,\" Albanese said.\"The terrorists, inspired by ISIS... sought to turn Australians against each other. Australians have responded to that act of hatred with love and sympathy for those in mourning.\"Tensions have been high in the country since the shooting, with police detaining seven men in southwest Sydney on Thursday after receiving a tip that a \"violent act was possibly being planned\", New South Wales Police said in a statement.Police said they did not identify \"any connection\" to their investigation into Sunday's attack in Bondi. Two cars were \"intercepted\" at George Street, police said. In videos shared by local media sites, armed officers appeared to detain people on the street just hours after Albanese made his speech.Antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal, who also spoke at the press conference, said the country was \"at a very important moment not only for our community, but for fighting antisemitism around the world.\" Albanese said his government would be \"fully supporting and adopting\" the  recommendations Segal put forward in July in a report.Her report was criticised by some upon its release in July due to its implications for free speech, including plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. There were concerns for instance, that the funding could be used to silence pro-Palestinian protests.The Jewish Council of Australia said it supported Albanese's commitment to act, including his focus on gun reform and online hate.But, it said it was \"concerned that elements of today's announcement resemble long-standing proposals from the pro-Israel lobby which have nothing to do with addressing violent extremism.\"\"If education initiatives like university scorecards become a form of ideological policing - particularly where they are used to limit legitimate criticism of Israel - they will only make Jews less safe, and do the opposite of combating antisemitism,\" Jewish Council of Australia executive officer Dr Max Kaiser said.Meanwhile, Albanese acknowledged accusations from the Jewish community that his government had not done enough to prevent antisemitism since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and said more could have been done. \"I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,\" he said. \"But what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation. Because what people are looking for at this time isn't more division.\"Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government was \"shifting the threshold\" on hate speech.\"There have been individuals who have managed to exploit a nation that had different principles of freedom of speech and have gone right to the limits of language that is clearly dehumanising, unacceptable, having no place in Australia, but have not quite crossed the threshold to violence,\" he said.Daniel Aghion, the President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak body representing Australian Jews, said he would \"need to see the details before making an assessment as to whether the measures are likely to live up to their billing.\"\"We warned of the risk of not dealing with antisemitism in this country promptly and effectively after 7 October. It is an absolute tragedy that it has taken a massacre of Jewish and other Australians for that step to be taken.\"",

    "body": "19 hours agoAmy WalkerGetty ImagesSpain experienced exceptionally warm weather and low rainfall this summerSpain is to set up a national network of climate shelters in public buildings to offer people refuge from intense heat before next summer, its prime minister has announced.The move was announced as Pedro Sanchez laid out a plan to address the impact of climate change during a conference in Madrid on Wednesday. \"Devastating droughts and heatwaves are no longer rare. Some summers, it's not separate waves we face, but one long heatwave stretching from June through August. This is now the new normal,\" he said.Spain experienced its hottest summer and three heatwaves in 2025. A 16-day heatwave in August saw temperatures exceed 45C (113F), according to the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET). As part of the national network of shelters, spaces to stay cool will be available to everyone, Sanchez said.Shelters will be funded by the government in areas \"that need them most, where the heat really hits people the hardest,\" he added.The rollout will be in addition to existing networks already set up by regional governments including in Catalonia, the Basque Country and Murcia.In Barcelona - the capital of the Catalonia region - about 400 climate shelters already exist in buildings including libraries, museums, sports facilities and shopping malls.The air conditioned spaces, usually with seating and free water, are meant to provide people with a refuge from the heat, particularly those with health problems, older people, babies, and those with limited resources.Getty ImagesBarcelona already has a network of climate shelters in public buildings with air conditioningSanchez also announced that the government would fund flood prevention plans in small towns, with €20m (£18m; $24m) also designated for fire prevention plans in small towns, as part of a state pact to address climate change.The set of proposals are yet to be brought before the Congress of Deputies, lower house of Spain's Parliament. Sanchez has asked other political groups to contribute to the pact, saying it is \"not an electoral weapon... it is a shield for Spain\".Heatwaves are becoming more common and intense due to human-caused climate change, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.More than 3,800 heat-related deaths were recorded in Spain amid searing temperatures this summer - 88% more than in 2024 -  according to estimates by the Ministry of Health. During 2025, Spain also experienced a devastating wildfire season, with over 400,000 hectares burned.",

    "body": "Researchers tracking wild polar bears in northern Canada have witnessed something exceedingly rare: a mother bear adopting a cub that was not biologically her own. The five-year-old mother bear and her 10- to 11-month-old cubs were observed and captured on camera during the annual polar bear migration along the Western Hudson Bay near Churchill, Manitoba, a town known for its polar bear population.\"It's unusual,\" Alyssa McCall, a scientist at Polar Bears International, said in a video. \"We don't really know why it happens... but we know it doesn't happen often at all.\"It's only the 13th known case of adoption out of the 4,600 bears studied for nearly five decades in the area. The mother bear was first captured as she emerged from her maternity den this spring. At the time, she had one cub, which scientists tagged for study.In the fall, she was seen again, but this time with two cubs - the original cub that had been tagged and another without a tag. Researchers aren't sure what happened to the new cub's biological mother, but they are trying to identify her with genetic samples. \"The bears need all the help they can get these days with climate change,\" Evan Richardson, a polar bear scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said in a video statement. \"If females have the opportunity to pick up another cub and care for it and successfully wean it, it's a good thing for bears in Churchill.\"Polar bears in the wild only have a 50% chance of surviving into adulthood, but having a mother caring for them improves their odds. The cubs appear to be healthy, researchers said, and they will likely stay with their mother until they are about two-and-a-half years old. Next, the family is expected to head out to sea ice, where the cubs will learn from their mother how to hunt seals and survive on their own. \"It's just nice to know that the bears are looking out for each other,\" Richardson said.

    "body": "8 hours agoAoife WalshandJames FitzGeraldUS President Donald Trump has ordered \"a total and complete\" blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela - a move denounced by Caracas as \"warmongering threats\".Trump wrote that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government had been designated a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO), which had also engaged in \"Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking\".His remarks come after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week, a significant action in light of the South American nation's reliance on oil.The US has also recently conducted deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, and has significantly built up its naval presence nearby.Trump's post did not give further detail of how the wide-ranging blockade on sanctioned oil tankers would be enforced.As of last week, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions, according to data compiled by TankerTrackers.com.Multiple new US sanctions on ships said to be carrying Venezuelan oil were issued after the tanker was seized. Sanctions were also placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US called his illegitimate regime.In his Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump wrote that Venezuela was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America\". He added that it would \"only get bigger\" and \"be like nothing they have ever seen before\".Trump also accused Maduro's government of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\". Tuesday's post from Trump suggested that a label the US had previously applied only to Maduro was now being widened to his whole government.Last month, the US formally alleged that the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles group was an FTO. The designation meant that Maduro was effectively designated as terrorist as well, because he was alleged to be group's leader - which he denies.In response to the recent US actions, Venezuela - home to the world's largest proven oil reserves - has accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.Trump has repeatedly accused Venezuela of drug smuggling, and since September the US military has killed about 100 people with its strikes on boats that were allegedly carrying fentanyl and other illegal drugs to the US. However, it has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, be it fentanyl - which is mainly produced in Mexico - or cocaine.Another ship accused of drug trafficking was destroyed by the US military on Wednesday. US officials say four men were killed in the strike, which took place in the eastern Pacific Ocean.Venezuela's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, even though the amount of oil it actually produces is relatively small given that the country is home to the world's largest proven reserves.When announcing the tanker seizure off Venezuela's coast last week, the White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port. Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.The US had been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the weeks and months before the raid.The build-up has involved thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing Texas, said Trump's \"naval blockade is unquestionably an act of war\".He added that US lawmakers would on Thursday vote on a resolution \"directing the president to end hostilities with Venezuela\". The US, under both Trump and former President Joe Biden, has opposed the Maduro government for years and pressed for him to be removed by imposing stringent sanctions.Maduro's government has been accused of rights abuses by the wider international community for many years. Venezuela's opposition, as well as many nations including the US, denounced last year's election as rigged and say his rule is therefore illegitimate.On Tuesday, the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, warned that the country's \"crackdown on civic space has intensified, suffocating people's freedoms\".",

    "body": "Trump announces 'warriors dividend' for troops as he defends economic record1 hour agoBernd Debusmann Jr,Washington andAnthony Zurcher,North America correspondentWatch: Trump says service members will receive $1,776 \"warrior dividend\"US President Donald Trump has announced a \"warrior dividend\" payment to US service members, in a speech in which he also defended his track record on the economy after 11 months back in office.In a televised address to the nation on Wednesday, Trump said cheques for $1,776 (£1,329) for 1.45 million US service members were already on the way\" and should arrive before Christmas. He said they would be paid for, in part, by his tariffs.In the combative address, Trump also touted his achievements on immigration while railing against opposition Democrats.Speaking loudly and quickly, he seemed determined to convince Americans that the US was doing well - and things would only get better. He claimed prices were falling, at a time when polls show that many Americans are unhappy about the cost of housing, childcare and healthcare.Democrats were critical of the speech. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the president's words \"showed he lives in a bubble completely disconnected from the reality everyday Americans are seeing and feeling\".Schumer added: \"People are feeling squeezed harder and harder every day and tonight Donald Trump took a victory lap.\"In the brief, 18-minute address, Trump said the \"warrior dividend\", which totals $2.57bn (£1.9bn), would be distributed \"in honour of our nation's founding in 1776\". Trump added that the funds were drawn from his sweeping tariffs, as well as the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" that he signed into law on 4 July.\"Nobody deserves it more than our military,\" he said. The president offered little new information in the speech, and some of his assertions were either exaggerated or unfounded. Much of Trump's address focused on his economic record and the administration's efforts to bring down prices - which he blamed on former US President Joe Biden and the Democrats. Trump mentioned the former president seven times.\"Now, under our leadership, they [prices] are all coming down and coming down fast,\" he said. \"Democrat politicians also sent the cost of groceries soaring, but we are solving that too.\" While fuel and egg prices have indeed fallen, many other food items are more expensive. Economic data from September shows the US inflation rate hit 3% for the first time since January, while consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since April due to concerns over the cost of living, jobs and the wider economy. Trump has previously acknowledged that concerns over rising prices have contributed to a lacklustre performance for candidates from his Republican Party during elections held in November - with the Democrats having success in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, as well as more recently in Miami and Georgia. He has also acknowledged that incumbent presidents and their parties often fare poorly in mid-term elections, which will take place next year. The White House has since been wrestling with how to address voter concerns about the economy, while at the same time pushing back on repeated Democratic criticism over rising prices.The political dilemma faced by the Trump administration has been highlighted by recent polling. One poll, from Politico, showed that about half of overall voters - and 4 in 10 people who voted for Trump in 2024 - felt the cost of living was the worst it has been in their lives.Another poll, released in November by CBS News/YouGov, suggested that Trump's approval on economic issues had dropped 15 points since March - with 36% of Americans approving his handling of the issue. More broadly, other polls show that Trump is at or near the lowest approval ratings of his second term, with concerns about the economy playing a significant role. While the president offered little in the way of empathy over prices, he did point to Republican efforts - such as tax reform legislation passed earlier this year - that he said would benefit many Americans in the coming year.When he ran for re-election last year, Trump promised immediate results. And after 11 months in office, many Americans say they still haven't seen substantive change, and the president's speech might be unlikely to change their minds. Trump, in part, focused his remarks on the promise of improvements during 250th birthday celebrations for American's founding next year. \"When the world looks at us next year, let them see a nation that is loyal to its citizens, faithful to its workers, confident to its identity, certain to its destiny, and the envy of the entire globe,\" he said.\"We are respected again, like we have never been respected before,\" he added.",

    "body": "Finland's delegate to last month's Miss Universe pageant held in Thailand has sparked controversy and outrage after a photo of her pulling the corners of her eyes went viral.Sarah Dzafce, who has been stripped of her Miss Finland crown, uploaded the photo with the caption \"eating with a Chinese\". The slanted-eyes pose is often seen as disrespectful to East Asians.The post drew backlash in Japan, South Korea and China against the 22-year-old and even against her country's flag carrier, Finnair.Finland's prime minister weighed in on Monday, saying that making such gestures was \"thoughtless and stupid\" and that the controversy that ensued was \"damaging\" to the country.Ms Dzafce claimed the gesture was her reaction to a headache during dinner. She said a friend added the offensive caption to the 11 December post without her consent, according to local tabloid Ilta-Sanomat.Ms Dzafce has apologised for the photo, noting it has \"caused ill will in many people\".\"That was not my intention in any way... One of the most important things for me is respect for people, their backgrounds and differences,\" she wrote on an Instagram post.  The apology still drew criticism, with some calling it \"insincere\" given it was written in Finnish.One person wrote: \"That was uncalled for, Asian people didn't do anything to you... We [are] still disappointed in you.\"Two right-wing MPs in Finland, Juho Eerola and Kaisa Garedew, posted photos of themselves mimicking Ms Dzafce's gesture to show their support for the beauty queen.The posts were taken down after backlash. Eerola apologised adding he felt Ms Dzafce was given \"disproportionately harsh punishment\".Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo condemned the MPs' actions as \"childish\", adding that lawmakers should set an example of proper conduct.The Finns Party is deliberating whether the MPs should face any sanctions for their actions, local media reported.Finnair told public broadcaster Yle that the controversy had affected the company, and that there had been calls for tourists to boycott Finland.\"The statements or posts mentioned by some Finnish members of parliament do not represent the values of Finnair,\" the airline wrote on its Japanese X account on Tuesday.\"As an airline supported by employees from diverse backgrounds and customers around the world, we promise to welcome everyone with respect,\" it wrote.The debacle has also drawn attention in Japan, South Korea and China, among other East Asian countries.A Japanese man living in Finland launched a petition calling for an investigation into anti-Asian discrimination, which had gathered more than 7,000 signatures as of Sunday evening, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.The Finnish embassy in Japan said it had received \"numerous opinions and questions\" on Finland's efforts to address racism. \"Racism remains a challenge in Finnish society, and its resolution requires continuous and resolute efforts,\" it acknowledged in an X post earlier this week.The controversy around Ms Dzafce is a postscript to a chaotic Miss Universe pageant hosted in Thailand that had been beset by walkouts and allegations of rigging.The Miss Finland Organisation said dethroning Ms Dzafce was a \"difficult but necessary\" move.\"Miss Finland holds a position of role-model status, which requires respecting all people regardless of their origin, background, or appearance,\" the organisation said in a statement.\"We are deeply sorry for the harm these events have caused. Especially to the Asian community, but also to everyone affected. Racism is never acceptable in any form,\" it wrote.",

    "body": "Naveed Akram, the surviving suspect in Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act, the New South Wales police say.Akram, 24, was critically injured during the incident. His father Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in an exchange of fire with police at the scene.Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in the attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. It was the country's deadliest shooting since 1996.Among the charges against Akram are 40 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, as well as one charge of causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.Akram had his first hearing from his hospital bedside, the local New South Wales court said. The case has been adjourned until April 2026, the court added. Earlier on Wednesday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said they were waiting for medication to wear off before formally questioning Akram.\"For his fairness, we need him to understand what is exactly happening,\" Lanyon said.As of Wednesday evening local time, 17 people are still being treated in hospitals across Sydney. One is in critical condition, with four others described as critical but stable.Police have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been \"motivated by Islamic State\" group ideology.On Tuesday, it emerged that the father and son had travelled to the Philippines in November.The Philippine immigration bureau told the BBC that they were in the country from 1 November to 28 November. Their final destination was the southern city of Davao, an immigration spokesperson said.Naveed Akram travelled to the Philippines using an Australian passport, while his father Sajid used an Indian passport, border authorities in Manila told the BBC.Sajid Akram was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, but had \"limited contact\" with his family there, a police official from the Indian state of Telangana said.Among those killed in the attack were two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl, named by her family as Matilda.Boris and Sofia Gurman, a couple filmed wrestling with one of the gunmen during the early stages of the attack, were also among the victims.Another 27 people were taken to hospital with injuries, including two police officers. One of the officers, named as 22-year-old Jack Hibbert, has lost vision in one eye and faces a \"long and challenging recovery\", his family said in a statement.Earlier in the day, thousands gathered to mourn British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, at the first funeral to be held for victims of the shooting.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was not present. Asked on ABC NewsRadio about his absence, he said: \"I would attend anything that I'm invited to. These are funerals that are taking place to farewell people's loved ones.\"The Jewish community has criticised Albanese for not taking enough action on antisemitism - he defended himself against those accusations, telling ABC NewsRadio he had taken a series of measures including appointing the country's first antisemitism envoy, toughening hate speech laws and increasing funding for social cohesion projects and Jewish institutions.Speaking at Rabbi Schlanger's funeral, Rabbi Levi Wolff described his death as an \"unspeakable loss\" for the community.\"Eli was ripped away from us, doing what he loved best,\" he said.\"Spreading love and joy and caring for his people with endless self-sacrifice in his life and in his death, he towered above as one of the highest and holiest souls.\"Rabbi Schlanger had helped organise Sunday's Hanukkah event.Funerals for the other victims are expected to happen over the coming days, including for the youngest victim, Matilda, on Thursday.",

    "body": "Heavy rains over the past week have compounded the already dire living conditions of the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, UN agencies say.Unicef spokesman Jonathan Crickx told the BBC that the weather overnight had been \"horrendous\", with the rain so intense that he had seen up to 15cm (6in) of water on the ground near his office.He said he was extremely concerned that children living in tents and makeshift shelters in wet clothing would succumb to hypothermia and other illnesses.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said one baby has died from hypothermia and at least 11 other people have died in building collapses caused by the severe weather.UN agencies have stepped up deliveries of tents, blankets and clothes since the Gaza ceasefire began nine weeks ago, but they have said there is still not enough aid getting in.The UN and its partners estimate that almost 55,000 families have so far been affected by the rains, with their belongings and shelters damaged or destroyed.More than 40 designated emergency shelters were severely flooded following downpours on Monday and Tuesday, forcing many people to relocate again.\"Last night was really horrendous for the families. The heavy rains were so intense that we could see from our office and guest house 10cm, 15cm (4-6in) of water at some point. And the winds were so strong,\" Jonathan Crickx, chief of communications for Unicef State of Palestine, told the BBC's Today programme on Wednesday.\"When I drove this morning, I could see that many, many people were trying with buckets to remove some of the water.\"He noted that most of the estimated one million people living in tents and makeshift shelters had been displaced many times during the two years of war between Israel and Hamas, and that they had no or very few changes of clothes.\"When I was seeing [children] this morning, their clothes were damp. I could see parents trying to dry some of the blankets they had. But it has been raining almost all of the time in the past four or five days, so it is extremely difficult to keep the children dry,\" he said.\"With temperatures about 7C, 8C (45-46F) at night, we are extremely concerned about children getting sick or even worse, dying from hypothermia.\"Many tents were also at risk of being blown away or destroyed by the strong winds accompanying the rain because they were only made from a piece of tarpaulin or plastic sheeting nailed to a fragile wooden structure, he added.Mr Crickx said Unicef had been able to bring in more aid during the ceasefire to help children cope with the harsh winter conditions, including 250,000 winter clothing kits, 600,000 blankets and 7,000 tents, but that it was not enough.\"We are working relentlessly to bring in that aid and to distribute it, but the scale of the needs is so immense that we still have thousands of people and children who are really suffering every night,\" he warned.Gaza's health ministry said a two-week old boy named Mohammed Abu al-Khair had died of hypothermia on Monday, two days after he had been admitted to hospital and placed in intensive care. Another 11 people had so far died after the war-damaged buildings where they were sheltering collapsed, it added.A spokesman for the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, Mahmoud Bassal, put the death toll higher. He said in a video that a total of 17 people, including four children, had died because of building collapses and the cold.He added that 17 residential buildings had collapsed completely because of the wind and rain and that another 90 buildings had collapsed partially.On Tuesday, video footage showed first responders from the Civil Defence recovering the body of a man from the rubble of a building in Shati refugee camp, north-west of Gaza City. Its roof had collapsed suddenly, according to eyewitnesses.\"We call on the world to solve our problems and rebuild the territory so that people can have homes instead of being displaced and living in the streets,\" said Ahmed al-Hosari, a relative of the man, told AFP news agency.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the collapse of damaged buildings due to the severe weather conditions was \"deeply concerning\".It stressed the need for \"increased and sustained humanitarian assistance to respond to urgent and long-term needs, including food, shelter and equipment for the repair of critical infrastructure\".Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's border crossings, has dismissed claims of deliberate aid restrictions as \"inconsistent with facts on the ground, and the ongoing co-ordination taking place daily\".It says that between 600 and 800 lorries carrying humanitarian supplies enter Gaza daily, and that almost 310,000 tents and tarpaulins have been delivered since the start of the ceasefire, along with more than 1,800 lorry loads of warm blankets and clothing.The UN says a total of 67,800 tents, 372,500 tarpaulins and 318,100 bedding items have been collected from crossings over the same period.The second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas includes plans for the reconstruction of Gaza, along with post-war governance, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.Last week, Israel's prime minister said the second phase was close, with only the body of one dead Israeli hostage in Gaza still to be returned by Hamas as part of the first phase.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 70,600 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "Don't let Matilda's death fuel anger, say family of Bondi victim, 10, at funeral4 hours agoTiffanie TurnbullandKaty Watson,SydneyVideo of Matilda at beach released as aunt calls for 'happiness and love'The family of the Bondi shooting's youngest victim, Matilda, urged the community not to let her death fuel anger, as they said a final goodbye to the 10-year-old on Thursday.Matilda was among 15 people who were shot dead when two gunmen opened fire on an event marking the start of Hanukkah at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday.Speaking to the BBC at Matilda's funeral, her aunt Lina Chernykh said the Jewish community is right to want more action to stamp out antisemitism – she does too.But she said Matilda was a joyous child who spread love everywhere she went, and urged the community to do the same in her honour.\"Take your anger and… just spread happiness and love and memory for my lovely niece,\" Ms Chernykh said.\"I hope maybe she's an angel now. Maybe she [will] send some good vibes to the world.\"Jewish community leaders have in recent days suggested the tragedy was an inevitable result of Australia struggling to address rising antisemitism.The attack on Sunday was the country's deadliest incident since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people during the Port Arthur massacre.Mourners - including the Governor General Sam Mostyn and New South Wales Premier Chris Minns - packed out the service in Sydney, wearing bee brooches and stickers as a tribute to the girl who adored them.Michael and Valentyna had named their daughter after the song Waltzing Matilda, as a tribute to the country where their Ukrainian family found safety.\"She's waltzing with the angels,\" Minns said, reading a poem in her honour.Family handoutMatilda was named for the country where her Ukrainian family found safetyRabbi Yehoram Ulman, who led the service, had to pause and collect himself as he paid tribute to Matilda's short life. \"The tragic, so totally cruel, unfathomable murder of young Matilda is something to all of us as if our own daughter was taken from us,\" he said.The service heard how she had lived with beauty, goodness and righteousness.\"The Jewish ... believe that death is not eternal … it is not because we are naïve,\" Rabbi Ulman said.\"I'm telling you with absolute conviction that the separation with Matilda is not forever.\"Still, he conceded that his words would likely offer little comfort - something he knows too well. A day earlier, Rabbi Ulman spoke at the funeral of his own son-in-law, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who was also killed in the attack on Bondi.\"You give me strength at a time when you need strength yourselves. And I try to do the same,\" he said to Matilda's parents, who sobbed in the front row.Ms Chernykh earlier said the family was devastated.\"I look at their faces [and] I don't know if they will be ever happy again,\" she said of Matilda's parents.Matilda's younger sister, from whom she was \"inseparable\", is shattered and confused, she said. \"She doesn't have enough tears to cry.\"EPALina Chernykh tells the BBC her niece Matilda was a joyous child who spread love everywhere she wentOn the same day the shooting's youngest victim was laid to rest, its eldest was too. A service for Alexander Kleytman - an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor - was held at the same funeral home on Thursday morning.In a statement, his family said he died doing what he loved most: protecting his wife Larisa and celebrating his Jewish faith. \"The two gunmen killed him, but his memories, his legacy, and his books will bring light for generations to come,\" it read.Their local Chabad mission later said Alexander had died \"shielding\" his wife from the gunmen's bullets.Police/Family handoutThe couple remarried under Jewish law on their 25th civil wedding anniversary, the family saidJewishCare, a local organisation, had praised the couple's \"resilience, strength, and adaptability\" which \"serve as a testament to the enduring nature of the human spirit\" in its 2023 annual report.Both Larisa and Alexander had faced \"the unspeakable terror of the Holocaust\", the organisation said, adding that the couple immigrated to Australia from Ukraine.\"Alex's memories are particularly harrowing; recalling the dreadful conditions in Siberia where he, along with his mother and younger brother, struggled for survival.\"The scars of the past, however, did not deter them from seeking a brighter future.\"In addition to his wife, he leaves behind two children and 11 grandchildren, Chabad confirmed in a statement.A funeral was also held on Thursday for another victim, 78-year-old Tibor Weitzen, who was described as a family man \"above all else\".His daughter Hanna Abesidon spoke at his funeral and said his love for his family was \"constant, unconditional and deeply felt\", ABC News reported.\"I'm so sorry I couldn't save you. I'm so sorry,\" she said.Dean Lewins/AAP/via ReutersLarisa (centre) said her husband had moved close to her once they heard gunshotsPolice have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been \"motivated by Islamic State\" group ideology.Police allege that the two gunmen were a father and son. Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead at the scene, while his son Naveed, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act.Two people out of the 16 injured who remain in hospitals are still in critical condition, local authorities said.Australia on Thursday announced it would strengthen laws to crack down on hate - including by introducing powers to cancel or refuse visas on grounds of antisemitism.",

    "body": "14 hours agoNardine Saad,Los Angeles andRegan Morris,Los AngelesWatch: \"Quite an occasion\" - BBC reports from Nick Reiner’s first court appearanceChildren of slain Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Reiner are speaking out for the first time after their deaths and the arrest of their brother, Nick. Jake and Romy Reiner said in a statement on Wednesday that they are experiencing \"unimaginable pain\" after the \"horrific and devastating loss\". They did not directly address the allegations against their brother.  Nick Reiner, 32, appeared in court for the first time on Wednesday and waived his right to enter a plea to two charges of first-degree murder. The couple were found dead on Sunday in their Los Angeles home. The county's medical examiner on Wednesday said they died in a homicide by multiple sharp force injuries.Nick Reiner was taken into custody on Sunday and charged with murder on Tuesday.\"The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience,\" Romy and Jake Reiner said in a statement provided to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner. \"They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends.\"\"We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life,\" they added. The siblings also asked for privacy \"and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave\".Family representatives did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.ReutersAt the hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, prosecutors and Mr Reiner's defence team agreed to delay his arraignment until 7 January, when he will once again have the opportunity to enter a plea.As he appeared in court, Mr Reiner said only \"yes, your honour\" when asked by Judge Theresa McGonigle if he understood that he has the right to a speedy trial.The judge earlier ordered the assembled media - who gathered outside the courthouse hours prior to the hearing - not to film the defendant, who was wearing a jail suicide-prevention smock.Media inside the courtroom could not see Mr Reiner during the brief hearing because he was sitting in a corner out of sight, but glimpses afterward revealed his face was blank, and his arms bare and shackled. He was initially slated to make a court appearance on Tuesday but had not been medically cleared to do so, his lawyer and prosecutors said.His lawyer, Alan Jackson, told reporters outside court that there were \"complex and serious issues\" in the case that needed to be worked through in the coming weeks.\"We ask that during this process, you allow the system to move forward in the way that it was designed to move forward,\" Mr Jackson told reporters.\"Not with a rush to judgement, not with jumping to conclusions, but with restraint and with dignity, and with the respect that this system and this process deserves, and that the family deserves,\" he said.The delay in Mr Reiner entering a plea could be designed to allow time for a psychiatric evaluation, one criminal defence lawyer told the BBC after the hearing.\"The psychiatric evaluation is generally done before arraignment to see if he is even fit to stand trial,\" Seth Zuckerman said.Getty ImagesNick Reiner (right) is accused of killing his parentsUntil the next hearing on 7 January, Mr Reiner will remain in custody at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles.If he pleads not guilty, he could be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors have said no decision has been made yet about whether the death penalty will be pursued.Rob Reiner directed a handful of iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.Michele Singer Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.\"This case is heartbreaking and deeply personal, not only for the Reiner family and their loved ones, but for the entire city,\" LA Police Department chief Jim McDonnell said.With additional reporting from Sakshi VenkatramanWatch: Moment Nick Reiner is arrested after being seen in convenience store",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorUkrinform/NurPhotoBelgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever is yet to be convinced that the money held in Belgium should be loaned to Ukraine (file pic)Volodymyr Zelensky is urging European Union leaders gathered at a crunch summit in Brussels to loan billions of euros in frozen Russian money to fund Ukraine's military and economic needs.Most of Russia's €210bn (£185bn; $245bn) worth of assets in the EU are held by Belgium-based organisation Euroclear, and so far Belgium and some other members of the bloc have said they are opposed to using the cash as a \"reparations loan\".Russia has warned the EU not to use its money, but without a boost in funding Ukraine's finances are set to run dry in a matter of months.\"I hope we will be able to get a positive decision,\" Zelensky told reporters. \"Without this there will be a big problem for Ukraine\". The Brussels summit comes at a pivotal moment in the war and Russia has filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court in a bid to get its money back.One European government official described being \"cautiously optimistic, not overly optimistic\" that a deal would be agreed. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said \"we will not leave the summit without a solution\".All eyes are on Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, who told the Belgian parliament on Thursday: \"I haven't yet seen any text that would persuade me to change Belgium's position\".US President Donald Trump has said a deal is closer than ever to end the war - which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. US and Russian officials are due to meet in Miami this weekend for further talks on a peace plan, a White House official told the AFP news agency. It is thought Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev will talk to Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Ukrainian officials are also heading to the US, and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is in Brussels, told reporters that Kyiv needed the money, either to support its army if the war continued, or to direct the funding entirely for recovery.Russia has not yet responded to the latest peace proposals, but the Kremlin has stressed that plans for a European-led multinational force for Ukraine supported by the US would not be acceptable.President Vladimir Putin made his feelings towards Europe clear on Wednesday, when he said the continent was in a state of \"total degradation\" and that \"European piglets\" - a derogatory description of Ukraine's European allies - were hoping to profit from Russia's collapse.Alexander KAZAKOV/POOL/AFPThose in favour of loaning Ukraine the money believe it will help deter Putin from continuing the warThe European Commission - the EU's executive arm - has proposed loaning Kyiv about €90bn (£79bn) over the next two years - out of the €210bn of Russian assets sitting in Europe.That is about two-thirds of the €137bn that Kyiv is thought to need to get through 2026 and 2027.Until now the EU has handed Ukraine the interest generated by the cash but not the cash itself.\"This is a crunch time for Ukraine to keep fighting for the next year,\" a Finnish government official told the BBC. \"There are of course peace negotiations but this gives Ukraine leverage to say 'we're not desperate and we have the funds to continue fighting'.\"The head of the European Commission says it will also ramp up the cost of war for Russia.Russia's frozen assets are not the only option on the table for EU leaders. Another idea, backed by Belgium, is based on the EU borrowing the money on the international markets, using the EU budget as a guarantee.However, that would require a unanimous vote and Hungary's Viktor Orban has made it clear he will not allow any more EU money to help Ukraine.For Ukraine, the hours ahead are significant and EU leaders have been keen to stress the momentous nature of the loan decision.\"We know the urgency. It is acute. We all feel it. We all see it,\" Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament.EPAUrsula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that two choices were on the table for EU leadersGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz has played a leading role in pushing for the Russian assets to be used, telling the Bundestag on the eve of the summit it was about sending a \"clear signal\" to Moscow that continuing the war was pointless.EU officials are confident they have a sound legal basis to use the frozen Russian assets, but so far the Belgian prime minister remains unconvinced. His defence minister Theo Francken warned ahead of the talks that it would be a big mistake to loan the Euroclear cash.Hungary is seen as the biggest opponent of the move and, ahead of the summit, Prime Minister Orban and his entourage even suggested that the frozen assets plan had been removed from the summit agenda. A European Commission official stressed that was not the case and it would be a matter for the 27 member states at the summit.Slovakia's Robert Fico has also opposed using the Russian assets, if it means the money being used to procure weapons rather than for reconstruction needs.When the pivotal vote does finally take place, it will require a majority of at least 15 member states making up 65% of Europe's population to go through. Whatever happens, European Council President António Costa has promised not to go over the heads of the Belgians.\"We're not going to vote against Belgium,\" he told Belgian public broadcaster RTBF. \"We'll continue to work very intensively with the Belgian government because we don't want to approve something that might not be acceptable for Belgium.\"Belgium will also be aware that ratings agency Fitch has placed Euroclear on a negative watch, partly because of \"low\" legal risks to its balance sheet from the European Commission's plans to use the Russian assets. Euroclear's chief executive has also warned against the plan.\"There are many hiccups and obstacles of course still on the way. We have to find a way to respond to Belgium's worries,\" the Finnish official added. \"We are on the same side as Belgium. We will find a solution together to make sure all the risks are checked as much as they can be checked.\"However, Belgium is not the only country to have doubts, and a majority is not guaranteed.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has told Italian MPs she will endorse the deal \"if the legal basis is solid\".\"If the legal basis for this initiative were not solid, we would be handing Russia its first real victory since the beginning of this conflict.\"Malta, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic are also said to be unconvinced by the controversial proposals.If the deal is passed and the Russian assets are given to Ukraine, the worst-case scenario for Belgium would be one in which a court would order it to hand the money back to Russia. Some countries have said they would be prepared to provide billions of euros in financial guarantees, but Belgium will want to see the numbers add up.At any rate, Commission officials are confident that the only way for Russia to get it back would be by paying reparations to Ukraine - at which point Ukraine would hand its \"reparations loan\" back to the EU.",

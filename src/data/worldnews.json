    "body": "35 minutes agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump threatened to hit Canada with a 100% tariff on all Canadian goods if the country's prime minister strikes a trade deal with China. \"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday. Tensions between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have escalated in recent days, after Carney gave a speech in Davos, Switzerland, pushing against the world's great powers.He recently met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and announced their countries had reached a trade deal that included electric vehicles.At the time, Trump hailed the potential deal as \"a good thing\". It is unclear if that deal has come into effect, or if Trump was referring to it specifically. The BBC has reached out to the White House, Carney's office and Canada's minister responsible for US-Canada trade for comment.In his Saturday post, Trump referred to the prime minister as \"Governor Carney\" and  wrote that if \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.\"Trump did not provide a timeline or more information about the threatened tariff. Last year, when he first threatened new tariffs on the US northern neighbour, Trump began calling Canada the US's \"51st state\" with Carney as its \"governor\", and suggested he may try to acquire the country entirely. While the countries' relationship had been improving in recent months, Trump's push to take control of Greenland and his comments about Nato had put him at odds with Canadian and European leaders. Carney did not mention the president by name in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this week, but he still angered Trump.\"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said in his own address, which followed Carney's.",

    "body": "2 hours agoReutersZhang Youxia was widely seen as President Xi's closest military allyChina's defence ministry says it has opened an investigation into the country's highest-ranking general over \"grave violations of discipline and the law\".The ministry gave no further details about accusations against General Zhang Youxia, who has widely been seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally. However in China the accusation of wrongdoing is usually a euphemism for corruption.In its announcement, the ministry said another senior military officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also under investigation.Their removal follows the expulsion of nine top generals in October - one of the largest public crackdowns on the military in decades. Zhang, 75, is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by President Xi which controls the armed forces.Zhang also sits on the party's top decision-making body, the 24-person Politburo.His father was one of the founding generals of the Chinese Communist Party.Zhang joined the army in 1968 and is one of only a few senior leaders with combat experience. He was kept in office beyond the customary retirement age for China's military, suggesting President Xi's confidence in him until now.The announcement comes days after rumours appeared that Zhang and Liu could be facing an investigation as they were not present at a high-level party event in December.ReutersPresident Xi has been accused of using corruption investigations to purge political rivalsSince coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives through various departments and this campaign has recently focused heavily on the military.He has called corruption \"the biggest threat\" to the Communist Party and said the fight against it  \"remains grave and complex\".Advocates say the policy promotes good governance, but others believe it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals.With the probe into Zhang and Liu, the CMC is now down from the original seven members to just two: Xi, who is the chairman, and Zhang Shengmin, who is responsible for the military's disciplinary affairs.More from the BBC",

Alex Honnold, who scaled El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park without a rope in 2017, said on Saturday: \"Sadly it's raining in Taipei right now so I don't get to go climbing.\" The skyscraper in Taiwan's capital measures 508m (1,667ft) and is made of steel, glass and concrete. It contains eight sections, each with a slight overhang designed to resemble joints on a bamboo stick.Netflix - which will stream the event - says there will be a delay on the live feed should the worst happen.\"It's obviously a conversation that everybody has,\" Netflix executive Jeff Gaspin told Variety magazine. \"We'll cut away. We have a 10-second delay. Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen.\"The climb is now due to take place on Sunday.  Announcing the delay, Netflix said: \"Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding.\"Taipei 101 has been conquered before. In 2004, France's Alain Robert, who called himself Spiderman, climbed it in four hours using a safety belt and rope.Netflix said there will be three stages to Honnold's rope-free climb. First, there is an initital 113m section of sloping steel and glass followed by the eight \"bamboo\" boxes before reaching the final stage which includes scaling the spire at the very top of the tower. Getty ImagesTaipei 101's surfaces were deemed too wet for a climb on Saturday Honnold, 40, who is married with two children, said it was \"a lifelong dream\" to scale a skyscraper.His historic 2017 ascent of El Capitan without a rope was documented in the film Free Solo, which won an Academy Award.An enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915m), El Capitan is a major landmark in Yosemite and entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.More from the BBC",

    "body": "11 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandHarry SekulichA young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark.\"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away,\" his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days.\"Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him,\" his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.",

    "body": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has weighed in on a separatist movement in Alberta, saying the western Canadian province is a \"natural partner for the US\". \"Alberta has a wealth of natural resources, but they won't let them build a pipeline to the Pacific,\" Bessent told an American right-wing commentator in an interview on Thursday. \"I think we should let them come down into the US, and Alberta is a natural partner for the US. They have great resources. The Albertans are very independent people.\" The top US official's comments come amid strained ties between US and Canada, and as signatures are being collected in the province seeking an independence referendum. In comments to conservative host Jack Posobiec, Bessent went on to say there is a \"rumour that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not\". A group in Alberta has until May to collect at least 178,000 signatures - or 10% of eligible voters - for a referendum campaign. Asked about Bessent's remarks on Friday, federal Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he'd tell him \"thanks but no thanks, we will do our own things\".He said Canadians are \"able to develop our natural resources at home\" and pointed to a deal recently inked by Prime Minister Mark Carney with Alberta that opens the door for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but one which faces significant hurdles.A spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a statement to the BBC that the province supports new pipelines \"west, east, north, and south, and we will continue to work with our US partners on building more pipeline capacity to US markets\". \"But the premier also believes the overwhelming majority of Albertans are not interested in becoming a US state\".Late last year over 430,000 signatures were gathered for a petition calling for a united Canada to counter the separatist push, and polls indicate a majority of Albertans want to stay in Canada. Many supporters of separatism have also told media they are seeking independence from Canada - not to join the US. Mitch Sylvestre, who is spearheading the referendum petition, told the CBC on Friday he doesn't think anyone in his movement is eyeing the US.He said he thought Bessent's comment on Alberta and the US being \"natural partners\" was obvious given the energy trade between them.Still, some organisers of the movement have said they have travelled to Washington to meet officials from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, trade talks between the US and Canada are on ice, and President Donald Trump has expressed irritation with the prime minister over a blunt speech he delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos calling out \"great powers\" for weaponising their economic might.Trump responded in his own speech with: \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"Other US officials have also criticised Carney's speech, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who this week accused Canada of being \"arrogant\" and Carney of pandering to a domestic audience by adopting an anti-US stance.",

    "body": "'I saw people getting shot': Eyewitness tells of Iran protest crackdown1 day agoSoroush PakzadParniaParnia was visiting family in Isfahan when the protests beganWarning: This story contains details which some readers might find distressing.An Iranian woman who witnessed the bloody crackdown on protests in Iran has described how her neighbourhood turned into a \"war zone\" as security forces opened fire at crowds with live ammunition.A government-imposed internet blackout in Iran, now in its third week, has prevented many accounts of what has happened from reaching the wider world.But some Iranians who have left the country have been able to share what they have seen.Parnia, who lives in London, told the BBC that she was visiting her family in the central city of Isfahan when the protests broke out in the capital, Tehran. They quickly spread across the country, and within days there were hundreds of protesters in the Hakim Nezami and Khaghani neighbourhoods of Isfahan.\"There were women and men from seven to 70 years old,\" she said. \"On just one street there were 200 to 300 people. People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'.\" The \"dictator\" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency.First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot.\"I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street.\"Parnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman. Inside, she said, were many injured protesters.\"I saw the lobby floor covered in blood, and I saw a girl whose leg was full of pellets.\"Videos verified by the BBC from that night show large numbers of people in the streets in Isfahan. Some streets were blocked by traffic sign poles and large metal sheets, in an apparent effort by protesters to protect themselves from gunfire.Footage also showed protesters breaking through the gates of the building of the national broadcaster Irib, which was later set on fire.Phone footageThe building of the state broadcaster in Isfahan was set on fireOn Friday morning, 9 January, Khamenei said Iran would not back down from dealing with what he called \"destructive elements\", a day after US President Donald Trump had threatened to hit Iran \"very hard\" if authorities started killing people.Following Khamenei's speech, the powerful Revolutionary Guards sent a text message to people across Iran, telling them to avoid gatherings on streets in areas of unrest. The messages also warned against co-operating with what it described as \"terrorist mercenaries\" - an act it said would constitute treason.Despite the risks, Parnia went out to protest again on Friday evening.\"The protesters were hopeful,\" she said. \"You could see fear on everyone's faces. We were afraid to pass in front of the security forces and come closer together,\" she said.\"We thought even if we get killed, it would be a reason for Trump to act faster.\"Footage obtained by the BBC from the previous day shows large crowds on main streets in Parnia's neighbourhood. But she said on the Friday it was different.Phone footageHundreds of people gathered on the streets of Isfahan to protest\"Protesters were in small groups gathered in alleyways. Every time that someone tried to gather in the larger street, we could hear live fire sound followed by screams and shouts.\"Because of the internet blackouts, and protesters avoiding taking their phones with them, the BBC has not yet obtained footage from Friday night.Parnia also described a scene of \"total chaos\" at a local clinic that was treating wounded protesters.\"No phone lines were working. Nobody could call their families, and many refused to go to hospitals, fearing they could be arrested there,\" she said. \"All the nurses could do was clean the wounds and send them home. The next day you could still smell the tear gasses in the air. Security forces were present and there were checkpoints across the city.\"Parnia left Isfahan that same day and travelled to the capital, Tehran, to catch a flight back to London.\"I arrived in Tehran at 6pm. All the shops were closed and many people gathered in the streets. At 8pm everyone started to chant and I could hear gunshots,\" she said.\"The airport was so busy. Many foreign airlines were cancelled and people were frustrated. Luckily, I found an Iranian flight to leave.\"Since her return to the UK, Parnia has been in touch with her friends in Isfahan.She said she learned from a source that doctors at Feiz eye hospital in Isfahan had carried out around 300 surgical procedures to remove the eyes of patients with birdshot-related facial injuries.\"Every time you go out into the streets, you see random people with eye patches,\" Parnia's friends told her.According to several health workers who spoke to the BBC, hospitals are monitored and controlled by security forces, and people with gunshot wounds in Isfahan are being arrested.\"Many of the injured are developing infections. Some doctors are referring them to surgeons who can treat them in private clinics,\" Parnia's cited her friends as saying.While Iranian authorities have said around 3,000 people were killed during the protests, US-based human rights group HRANA has so far confirmed more than 4,600 deaths, with another 9,700 cases still under review. According to the group, at least 7,300 people have also sustained serious injuries. Many believe the true figures may be even higher.Parnia said she was now preparing to join Iranian opposition protests in the UK, saying she wants to be a voice for the silenced protesters.She also expressed anger at international media reports suggesting that Iranians and the country's political opposition was not united.\"Iranians have shown what they want in the streets and paid a high price for it.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringUkraine is now living through its most difficult winter in recent memory. With January temperatures plummeting below -15C, Russia has been attacking energy infrastructure, leaving about a million Ukrainians without heating.The capital, Kyiv, is the main target of such attacks. Following the latest Russian bombardment overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. \"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. \"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that.\" She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing.What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators.Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons.In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers.Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing.The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as \"panelki\", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as \"khrushchevki\", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s.Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for \"heat and electricity centrals\" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat.Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as \"private houses\" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities.\"Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised,\" Korolchuk told the BBC. \"These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war.\"According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia.\"During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.",

    "body": "10 hours agoClaire KeenanReutersPolice say they are not expecting to find any more survivors from the landslide Rescue efforts for six missing people buried by a landslide in New Zealand on Thursday have been called off, with efforts now moving to recovering bodies, police have said. \"Tragically it is now apparent that we will not be able to bring them home alive,\" Anderson said, adding that formal identification is underway. Two teenagers are among those who remain unaccounted for, with the youngest aged 15 years old. Search teams located human remains beneath dirt and debris on Friday evening,  Police Superintendent Tim Anderson said, after a landslide hit a popular campsite in Mount Maunganui. \"This is heartbreaking news for the families and the dozens of people who have been working day and night, hoping for a positive outcome,\" Anderson said. In a separate incident, two people died - a grandmother and her grandchild - in a different landslide at Welcome Bay, nearby Mount Maunganui, public service broadcaster Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported. Heavy rain has fallen on New Zealand's North Island for days, with more wet weather forecast for the area over the weekend.Police said conditions have added to the difficulty of rescue efforts, and described the scene at Mount Maunganui as \"incredibly challenging... to work through\". Watch: Footage captures moment landslide starts in Mount Maunganui in New ZealandFire and emergency services worked through the night to locate those unaccounted for at the campsite before the operation was formally handed over to police on Saturday. The safety of workers on the ground is of \"upmost importance\", Anderson said. Police have confirmed the names of the six individuals unaccounted for as Lisa Anne Maclennan, 50, from Morrinsville, Måns Loke Bernhardsson, 20, from Sweden, Jacqualine Suzanne Wheeler, 71, from Rotorua, and Susan Doreen Knowles, 71, from Ngongotaha. The youngest victims have been identified by police as Sharon Maccanico, 15, from Auckland and Max Furse-Kee, 15, from Auckland. ReutersMembers of the public lay floral tributes at scene of the landslide in Mount MaunganuiChief Coroner Judge Anna Tutton confirmed the identification process is underway, but warned it would likely be \"complex\" and \"painstaking\". \"We will work very carefully - and as quickly as we can - to reunite families,\" she said. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon visited the site on Friday. He said it was \"inspiring\" to see the show of community support as locals helped clear debris in flood-hit areas. Mount Maunganui is a sacred Māori site and one of the most popular campgrounds in New Zealand. It has been repeatedly hit by landslides in recent years.",

    "body": "Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift8 hours agoClaire KeenanReutersHomeland security is the top priority in the Pentagon's new National Defense StrategyThe US will offer \"more limited\" support to allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy.In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern.Previous versions of the strategy -  published every four years - named the threat posed by China as the top defence priority. Relations with China will now be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater \"burden-sharing\" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".Late last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to acquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is \"not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. \"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". ",

    "body": "13 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoTikTok's new US joint venture has made changes to its privacy policy that include expanding the type of location data the company can collect from its 200 million American users.The new policy was published after investors closed a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance on Thursday to run the popular short-form video app's business in the US.The new joint venture said in its updated privacy terms that it may now \"collect precise location data, depending on your settings\" -  a change from the previous policy which allowed for the collection of \"approximate\" location data.TikTok did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the change. The company policy added that the sensitive personal information would be processed \"in accordance with applicable law\" and that users can turn off location services in their device settings at any time.Even before the new venture was established, TikTok collected location information based on a user's SIM card or IP address, or both.But it stopped short of collecting even approximate GPS information from American users operating the most updated version of the app, according to a 2024 version of its privacy policy.Precise location sharing hasn't yet been enabled in the US, where it is expected to be optional and turned off by default so users will be asked to opt in with a pop-up message. TikTok has not said when the update is due to reach American users.TikTok already collects similar data from users in the UK and Europe as part of a new \"Nearby Feed\" feature that lets users find events and businesses near them.The new American TikTok joint venture is also extending its permissions for gathering information about users interactions with TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI) tools.This includes prompts and questions submitted by users, as well as information about how, when, and where AI content was prompted or created.TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is comprised of three managing investors including cloud computing giant Oracle, which is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and has taken on significant debt to finance its ambitions in the burgeoning space.Oracle is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican megadonor and longtime ally of US President Donald Trump, whose administration helped broker the US TikTok deal.The agreement follows years of tussling between Washington and Beijing that began in Trump's first presidential term, when he tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over national security concerns.In 2024, the US passed a law that required the platform to be banned in the US by January 2025 if ByteDance failed to sell its US operations to American investors.Trump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation until the joint venture was finalised this week.The 2024 law was prompted in part by concerns about the possibility that Beijing might access the data of TikTok's American users.In a statement onThursday, the new joint venture said its mandate was \"to secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures\".Oracle will oversee the retraining of TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm on existing American user data, the joint venture said in its statement, adding that the algorithm \"will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.\"ByteDance retains a minority stake just shy of 20% in the joint venture.Other managing investors include the US tech investment firm Silver Lake and Abu-Dhabi state-owned investment fund MGX, which has done business with the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial.On Friday, Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, expressed concern about ByteDance's ongoing involvement in TikTok's US operations.\"Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm? Can the parties involved assure Americans their data is secure?\" he said in a statement. \"Those are questions that need to be answered as the Select Committee does oversight of this deal.\"",

US officials had said they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.The head of Canada's federal police force, which assisted in the investigation, spoke alongside Patel on Friday to praise the law enforcement operation.\"No single agency or nation can combat transnational organised crime alone,\" said Mike Duheme, Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). \"We can finally say that our communities, our countries, are much safer with the arrest of Ryan Wedding,\" he added.Wedding is expected to make his first court appearance in Los Angeles on Monday.FBIWedding, seen in an undated photo released by the FBIWedding is accused of running a vast drug trafficking operation responsible for importing some 60 metric tonnes of cocaine a year.The organisation operated across North America, as well as several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and was also the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, bringing in an estimated $1bn a year. Before he was arrested, Wedding was accused of killing a federal witness in a case against him. Officials say he has also ordered the murders of several others.Wedding is now facing a slew of felony charges, including witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking.The FBI had previously placed a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest. Patel declined to comment on whether anyone would be claiming the reward money.US officials have released limited details regarding how Wedding was captured, except to say that his arrest took place on Thursday night in Mexico City. Mexico's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, said in a post on X that Patel had visited Mexico City on Thursday, and departed with two fugitives on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. He did not name the men arrested, but said one was a \"Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered\" at the US embassy in Mexico. Watch: FBI director calls Ryan Wedding \"a modern day Pablo Escobar\"The Associated Press, citing an unnamed Mexican Security Cabinet member,  reported that Wedding is the Canadian who turned himself in at the US embassy. In his remarks at a news conference, Patel described Wedding as a \"modern-day Pablo Escobar\", referring to the Colombian cartel leader. US officials have also compared him to Mexican drug dealer Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán.\"When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front,\" Patel said, thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation.Patel also thanked the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, who participated in taking Wedding into custody.In an interview with Vanity Fair, Patel praised the team, which had also been involved in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro weeks earlier.\"This was a complex, high-stakes operation with zero margin for error,\" Patel told the magazine. \"I was on the ground with our team in Mexico and witnessed extraordinary teamwork, precision, and trust between our agents and partners in Mexico.\"Wedding's aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI said. He has reportedly had plastic surgery to change his appearance while on the run.Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.Authorities allege he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.Getty ImagesThe FBI had offered a $15m reward for Ryan WeddingOfficials say he had been living in luxury in Mexico. In December, Mexican authorities announced that they had seized $40m in racing motorcycles owned by Wedding. They also seized other valuable items, including luxury paintings, artworks, drugs and two Olympic gold medals.It is unclear to whom the medals belong. Wedding competed for Canada in the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, but did not win any medals. He came in 24th place in the men's giant parallel slalom ski event.In November, the FBI seized his rare 2002 Mercedes CLK-GTR, which had been valued at $13m.Patel also spoke about the recent arrest of another man in Mexico who had been on the FBI's most wanted list. American man Alejandro Castillo was wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend. According to the FBI, he has been in hiding in Mexico for nearly 10 years, and will now be extradited back to North Carolina for trial. ",

    "body": "Mandela's prison key, sunglasses and shirt can be sold after daughter wins court battleA South African court has dismissed an appeal by the country's heritage body to stop the sale and export of various artefacts connected to anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela.The 70 personal items include a cell key from Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 of the 27 years he was locked up, a pair of Aviator sunglasses and one of his signature floral shirts. They were due to be exported to the US for auction.The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration. In trying to stop their sale, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export.The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m).The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa.Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former president's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province.In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argued that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad.The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were.It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment.Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming \"to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family\".\"Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name,\" she said.She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction.Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations.Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects.Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He led the African National Congress in its struggle against apartheid - a system of legally enforced racism - and was released from prison in 1990.He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with then-President FW de Klerk.Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994.",

    "body": "21 hours agoFrank GardnerBBC Security CorrespondentPA MediaBlast walls, rocket attacks, Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)... and long queues in the canteen. Anyone who deployed to Afghanistan, in whatever role, between 2001-2021 will have their own vivid memories of that time. It started with the flight in – to Kandahar, Kabul or Camp Bastion. It could be a long, slow descent with the lights out on an RAF jet, or a rapid, corkscrew down in a C-130 transport plane. In both cases the aim was to avoid being blown out of the air by a Taliban surface-to-air missile.Over the course of 20 years thousands of servicemen and women, as well as civilians, from dozens of countries deployed to Afghanistan, answering the US call for assistance. That call came in the form of invoking Nato's Article 5 of its charter – the only time it has ever happened in Nato's 77-year history – which states that an attack on one member shall be deemed an attack on all.America was reeling from the devastating 9/11 attacks when al-Qaeda, which was being sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan, murdered nearly 3,000 people by flying packed airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington.The Taliban were swiftly driven from power in a joint effort by the US military, the CIA and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. Then it was all about trying to hunt down the remnants of al-Qaeda as Britain's Royal Marines, together with UK Special Forces, pursued them over the mountains but many escaped to safety to regroup in Pakistan. It was not until ten years later that the US Navy's Seal Team Six commandos tracked down the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan.The first two years of the US-led \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" as it was called, were relatively quiet. By late 2003, as America's attention switched to Iraq, US servicemen we met even started referring to Afghanistan as \"Op Forgotten\". But it was still dangerous. From a rain-soaked Kandahar airbase we watched Romanian troops edge nervously out on patrol in their Soviet-era armoured vehicles, wary of the next ambush. Flying into a remote US-manned firebase in the mountainous Paktika province in a Blackhawk helicopter, my BBC crew and I were told cheerfully: \"You've come to the worst place in the world\". Sure enough, the Taliban launched Chinese-made rockets at the base after dark, planted there, we were told, by farmers who had been either bribed or coerced into doing so.Everything changed after 2006, when the UK deployed in force to Helmand province, a part of Afghanistan that had been relatively peaceful until then. The Taliban made their intentions clear. If you come, they said, then we will fight you. And yet the UK government at the time appeared shocked at the ferocity of the fighting 3 Para now found themselves engaged in, with British paratroopers calling in mortar and artillery fire so close to their positions it was termed \"danger close\", in an effort to stop their bases from being overrun.Over the next eight years, until the end of combat operations in 2014, it was not just Americans who were risking life and limb to serve in Afghanistan. Brits, Canadians, Danes and Estonians were among those who saw the toughest fighting in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. It would also be churlish to ignore the bravery and sacrifice of so many Afghans who fought and died over two decades.I say \"fighting\" but most soldiers' biggest fears stemmed from the hidden IEDs, those expertly concealed Improvised Explosive Devices. The Taliban, who of course knew every inch of their terrain, were often able to guess correctly exactly where troops would need to cross an irrigation ditch or canal and so place the bomb accordingly. In the space of a split second, in a blinding flash and puff of black smoke, a fit, healthy, 20-something individual would have their life either ended or catastrophically changed, facing amputation and a host of other complications. So prevalent were these IEDs that soldiers were going out of the gates of their FOBs - Forward Operating Bases - on patrol praying that if they got hit it would result in a below-the-knee amputation, not one above the knee.The courage and resilience of the people I have met since, who have managed, despite terrible loss and adversity, to turn their shattered lives around, is both humbling and awe-inspiring. These are just some of the people who answered America's call for help after the 9/11 attacks. It is little wonder there has been such nationwide outrage at that country's president's suggestion that they somehow dodged the fighting.",

    "body": "43 minutes agoDearbail JordanWatch: Firefighters battle blazes in Kyiv and Kharkiv after Russian strikesThe first three-way talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US have ended with no apparent breakthrough, following renewed Russian bombardment of Ukrainian targets.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the possibility of a second meeting as early as next week after two days of talks in Abu Djabi. In a post on X, he said \"a lot was discussed\" and called conversations \"constructive\". The meeting concluded after waves of Russian strikes killed one person and injured 35 others overnight into Saturday.Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the \"brutal\" attack - \"cynically\" ordered by Russian leader Vladimir Putin - had \"hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table\".The talks in Abu Dhabi were first trilateral meeting since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022.\"The central focus of the discussions was the possible parameters for ending the war. I highly value the understanding of the need for American monitoring and oversight of the process of ending the war and ensuring genuine security,\" he said. He added that all sides had agreed to \"report back to their capitals\" and coordinate further steps with their leaders.\"The military representatives identified a list of issues for a potential next meeting. Provided there is readiness to move forward - and Ukraine is ready - further meetings will take place, potentially as early as next week.\" Russian news agency RIA also reported Moscow remained open to a continuation of dialogue between Russia, Ukraine and the US. Following overnight Russian attacks, the mayor of Ukrainian capital Kyiv said one person had died and four had been wounded while Kharkiv's mayor reported that 31 people had been hurt.On the second day of the three-way talks in Abu Dhabi, Sybiha said the \"barbaric\" overnight assault proved  \"that Putin's place is not at the board of peace, but at the dock of the special tribunal\".US President Donald Trump said last week that Putin had accepted an invitation to join his Board of Peace - an organisation focused on ending global conflicts. Putin has not confirmed this. How Soviet urban planning is helping Russia freeze UkraineKyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three of the four people who had been injured had been hospitalised.He added that the capital's critical infrastructure had been damaged, leaving 6,000 buildings without heating.Temperatures have fallen to around -12C in parts of Ukraine. In a statement following the assaults, Zelensky said: \"The main target of the Russians was the energy infrastructure.\"Last week, Russia attacked Kyiv's power infrastructure, forcing Zelensky to initially call off his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  In Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said 31 people had been injured during the strikes in the early hours of Saturday morning. A maternity hospital and a hostel for displaced people were damaged.ReutersTalks between Ukraine, Russia and the US are being hosted by the United Arab EmiratesRussia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over large areas of the territory, but Ukraine has ruled this out.In Davos, Zelensky said: \"It's all about the land. This is the issue which is not solved yet.\"He said that he had reached an agreement with Trump on future US security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a deal.He gave no detail but said it would need to go before US Congress and the Ukrainian parliament before signing.Global News Podcast: Can Ukraine get peace without losing land?The day before the talks in Abu Dhabi began, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Putin in Moscow. After the four-hour meeting, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said: \"Vladimir Putin has emphasised Russia's sincere commitment to settling the Ukraine crisis by political and diplomatic means.\"But he said \"bringing about a lasting settlement would be unlikely without addressing the territorial issue based on the formula as agreed in Anchorage\".Last August, Trump and Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska to discuss ending the war, resulting in an agreement to allow Russia to take the Donbas region and keep control of the Crimean peninsula, which it allegally annexed in 2014.Zelensky ruled out giving up the Donbas which is made up of Luhansk and Donetsk and has been partly occupied by Russia for 12 years.Following the first day of talks in Abu Dhabi, Rustem Umerov, who is leading the Ukrainian delegation, said on social media: \"The meeting focused on the parameters for ending Russia's war and the further logic of the negotiation process aimed at advancing toward a dignified and lasting peace.\"",

He is also the patron saint of animals and the environment.The Feast of St Francis is celebrated annually on 4 October to mark the day of his death in 1226.The late Pope Francis, who died last year after leading the Roman Catholic Church for more than a decade, chose his name and modelled his papacy after the radical humility of Saint Francis.St Francis of Assisi's bones will be on display until 22 March.

Irkutsk regional Governor Igor Kobzev offered his \"deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims\". He earlier said one Chinese tourist had managed to escape. The depth at the site of Friday's accident was 18m (59ft), and the divers had to use underwater cameras to search for the bodies.Baikal - the world's deepest lake with a maximum depth of 1,642m (5,387ft) - is a popular tourist destination. It often freezes during harsh winters and has seen a number of deadly accidents over the years.The bus fell into three-metre-wide ice fissure on Friday, Kobzev said in a post on Telegram.\"I would like to remind you once again that going out onto Lake Baikal's ice is not just prohibited right now. It's mortally dangerous,\" the governor said, urging tourists to use only official tour operators.He added that all the Chinese tourists - including a 14-year-old child - had travelled independently. A criminal investigation into the cause of the tragedy is now under way.Shortly afterwards Kobzev took to social media again, saying that \"sadly, even this tragedy hasn't taught people a lesson\", informing that six people trapped in their cars had been rescued in two separate incidents on Friday and Saturday.In late January, a Chinese tourist died after a car he was travelling overturned on the frozen surface of Lake Baikal.",

    "body": "Kim Jong Un re-appointed leader of North Korea's ruling party3 hours agoKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesIn his opening speech at the congress, Kim Jong Un vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of livingNorth Korea's ruling Workers' Party has again chosen Kim Jong Un to be its general secretary, state media report.The announcement by the rubber-stamp party congress on Sunday comes as little surprise given the Kim family has ruled the dictatorship since the late 1940s.State-run KCNA said that under Kim's leadership North Korea \"radically improved\" its \"war deterrence\", \"with the nuclear forces as its pivot\".Despite long-standing international sanctions, North Korea has continued to build its nuclear capabilities, regularly testing banned intercontinental missiles. But the secrecy of the regime makes it harder to evaluate how much progress the military has made.  Kim, who took over control of the regime after his father's death in 2011, has invested heavily in the nuclear weapons programme, turning Pyongyang into a far bigger challenge for the West, and especially the US.  He is expected to announce the next phase of the country's weapons programme during the congress, which is now in its fourth day. Before it started, North Korea unveiled what it said was a range of nuclear-capable rocket launchers.The congress, which has been held once every five years in the last decade, began on 19 February.With some 5,000 party members in attendance, according to KCNA, it offers a rare glimpse into the structure of political power in North Korea, which remains quite opaque even to the keenest watchers.The meetings are considered to be the most important political event and provide insight into where the country's priorities lie, from foreign policy to its nuclear ambitions.While Kim has remained at the top of North Korean leadership, the party congress' presidium, or executive committee, has been reshuffled since the last meeting in 2021. More than half of its 39 members have been replaced, according to state media.In his opening speech last week, Kim vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living, which he described as \"heavy and urgent historic tasks\".And all eyes are on whether Kim's daughter, Ju Ae, will make an appearance.Earlier this month, South Korea's spy agency said that Kim had chosen Ju Ae as his heir. Kim Ju Ae, believed to be 13 years old, has become an increasingly prominent figure at official events - inspecting missiles and attending Beijing's military parade with her father.",

    "body": "1 day agoOttilie MitchellReutersVenezuelan Interim President Delcy Rodríguez and her brother National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez at Miraflores Palace in CaracasA total of 1,557 Venezuelan political prisoners have applied for amnesty under a new law introduced on Thursday, the country's National Assembly President has said. Jorge Rodríguez, brother of Venezuelan interim President Delcy Rodríguez and an ally of former President Nicolás Maduro, also said \"hundreds\" of prisoners had  already been released. Among them is politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of several opposition voices to have criticised the law for excluding certain prisoners.The US has urged Venezuela to speed up its release of political prisoners since US forces seized Maduro in a raid on 3 January. Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners.At a news conference on Saturday Jorge Rodríguez said 1,557 release requests were being addressed \"immediately\" and ultimately the legislation would extend to 11,000 prisoners.The government first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics for years. These groups have also criticised the new law. One frequently cited criticism is that it would not extend amnesty to those who called for foreign armed intervention in Venezuela, BBC Latin America specialist Luis Fajardo says.He noted that law professor Juan Carlos Apitz, of the Central University of Venezuela, told CNN Español that that part of the amnesty law \"has a name and surname\". \"That paragraph is the Maria Corina Machado paragraph.\" It is not clear if the amnesty would actually cover Machado, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, Fajardo said.He added that other controversial aspects of the law include the apparent exclusion from amnesty benefits of dozens of military officers involved in rebellions against the Maduro administration over the years.On Saturday, Rodríguez said it is \"releases from Zona Seven of El Helicoide that they're handling first\". Those jailed at the infamous prison in Caracas would be released \"over the next few hours\", he added.Activists say some family members of those imprisoned in the facility have gone on hunger strike to demand the release of their relatives.Maduro is awaiting trial in custody in the US alongside his wife Cilia Flores and has pleaded not guilty to drugs and weapons charges, saying that he is a \"prisoner of war\".",

Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

The devices were planted in waste bins, it added.President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed \"an individual suspected of carrying out the terrorist attack\" had been detained. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said she was a Ukrainian woman.The police later said the 33-year-old suspect had made and planted the explosives on the \"instruction\" of an agent of Russia's special services.The victim of the attack was named as Viktoria Shpylka. \"She was only 23 years old and had begun her service at the start of the full-scale invasion of the Kherson region,\" the police wrote on Telegram on Sunday morning.National Police of UkrainePolice officer Viktoria Shpylka was killed in the attackPolice said the first blast occurred after a police car arrived at the scene of the reported break-in at a shop in the city centre.\"Later, when a second crew arrived, another explosion went off,\" it added.Eleven people were admitted to hospital, six of whom were law enforcement officers in serious conditions.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said police and the Security Service of Ukraine had detained the suspect, a resident of the north-western Rivne region.\"We are identifying other persons involved in committing this crime,\" he wrote on Telegram.Meanwhile, the regional prosecutor's office said it had started an investigation into the \"act of terrorism that led to grave consequences\".National Police of Ukraine/TelegramA number of officials were also injured after bombs detonated when they arrived to a reported break-in overnightElsewhere, Ukraine faced another night of overnight Russian strikes ahead of the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on Tuesday.Kyiv said its air defences had countered 50 Russian missiles and nearly 300 drones overnight. The attacks targeted the energy sector, residential buildings, and railways, Zelensky said.At least one person was killed in the Kyiv region, top local official Mykola Kalashnyk said, while a woman and a child were taken to hospital with injuries.The latest aerial attack comes two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin has become the biggest war in Europe since World War Two, with hundreds of thousands of military casualties -killed, wounded and missing - believed to be on each side.Western military experts estimate that Russian combat losses have been much higher than Ukraine's.Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it annexed in 2014.",

    "body": "12 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe US operates two dedicated hospital boats, including the USNS Mercy Greenland's prime minister has asked US President Donald Trump to talk to him instead of making \"random outbursts on social media\", after Trump said he was sending a US hospital boat to \"take care\" of people on the island.Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was going to send a boat filled with medical supplies, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\".Jens-Frederik Nielsen responded \"it's going to be a no thanks from us,\" and said that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US. Trump has long coveted the vast arctic island - but conceded in January that he would not take it by force, after previously refusing to rule out doing so. He later announced a \"framework for a future deal\" around the US and Greenland, after Denmark and Nato allies made it clear that they would not give in to his calls to relinquish sovereignty.In his post on social media, Trump said that he and his Greenland envoy Jeff Landry were \"going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It's on the way!!!\"The post included what appeared to be an illustrated or AI image of the USNS Mercy, one of two hospital ships operated by the US navy. It is not clear if Trump was referencing either of those ships, or what had prompted his decision. Responding to the post, Nielsen said that Trump's idea \"is noted. But we have a public healthcare system where treatment is free for citizens.\"\"It's not like that in the United States, where it costs money to go to the doctor,\" he wrote on Facebook.Nielsen added that Greenland remained open to cooperating with the US but underlined the importance of discussing issues directly.\"Talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media,\" he said.Trump's post came soon after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine close to Nuuk. It is not clear if Trump's post was related to the incident.A month on from Trump announcing a \"framework for a future deal\" over Greenland, details are still unclear, though earlier this month US vice president JD Vance alleged that European countries were \"willing to make a lot of accommodations\".",

    "body": "Final missing Lake Tahoe skier found dead 5 days after avalanche 1 day agoChristal Hayes and Nardine SaadLos Angeles, California ReutersThe ninth and final missing skier has been found dead in California's Lake Tahoe backcountry, five days after a powerful avalanche struck several guides and a tight-knit group of friends on a trip. Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said on Saturday during a news conference that all nine bodies have now been recovered from the Castle Peak area in the Sierra Nevada mountains. She also released the names of all nine victims, which included close friends, a pair of sisters and three guides. Two people who were part of the group escaped the \"football-field sized\" avalanche - the deadliest in modern California history - and authorities said they might help piece together what happened.Sheriff Moon and others during the news conference described the harsh weather rescue crews were met with after the avalanche, and that white-out conditions stalled days of searching.Authorities said there was an ongoing avalanche risk after the Tuesday disaster and high winds prevented them from being able to utilize helicopters for days.When winds calmed on Friday, helicopters were used to pour water over the area - a tactic meant to mitigate an avalanche risk - authorities said. Crews were then sent to search for the ninth missing skier.The victims were confirmed on Saturday as: Carrie Atkin, 46, of Soda Springs, California; Lizabeth Clabaugh, 52, of Boise, Idaho; Danielle Keatley, 44, of Soda Springs and Larkspur, California; Kate Morse, 45, of Soda Springs and Tiburon, California; Caroline Sekar, 45, of Soda Springs and San Francisco, California; and Katherine Vitt, 43, of Greenbrae, California.The three Blackbird Mountain guides who died were identified as Andrew Alissandratos, 34, of Verdi, Nevada; Nicole Choo, 42, of South Lake Tahoe, California, and Michael Henry, 30, from Soda Springs.Earlier this week, a family spokesperson identified several of the skiers to the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\"While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,\" Moon said at the news conference.She said they relied on avalanche experts, who said the disaster spread across the size of an American football field and was nearly powerful enough to take out a house.Six members of the 15-person backcountry ski group were rescued early this week. The group was on its way back from a three-day guided ski trip in the backcountry when the avalanche struck, bringing with it eight feet (2.4 meters) of snow and 90 mph winds.Nevada County Undersheriff Sam Brown on Thursday told CBS that when the avalanche hit, the skiers went into what he called \"frantic mode\" to try to find their friends and partners.\"They were ultimately able to unbury three individuals who did not survive,\" Brown said.The Nevada County Sheriff's Office said on Friday that authorities are investigating whether there could be criminal negligence relating to the avalanche, CBS reported.",

Katseye remains committed to showing up for one another and for the fans who mean everything to us.\"Katseye confirmed they would continue scheduled performances during Bannerman's absence and \"look forward to being together again when the time is right\".No timeline has been given for her return.Getty ImagesBannerman reassured fans that she was \"healthy\" and taking care of herselfThe group - which also includes Daniela Avanzini, Lara Raj, Megan Skiendiel, Sophia Laforteza and Yoonchae Jeung - was formed during the 2023 reality competition series The Debut: Dream Academy.They released their first single in June 2024 with the song Debut and have since released two EPs, SIS (Soft is Strong) and Beautiful Chaos, alongside a string of singles.The group has previously spoken about the pressures of their rapid global rise to fame and the online scrutiny that has accompanied it. \"I try to tell myself it doesn't matter, but if 1,000 people are sending you death threats, it's jarring,\" Lara Raj told the BBC.Raj said people see the band as \"women to rank,\" calling it \"so dystopian\".Bannerman added that it was \"very terrorising on the mind\".More on this story",

    "body": "1 day agoTom BatemanState Department correspondentAmmar Awad via ReutersThe mother of Nasrallah Abu Siyam, 19, grieves at his funeral on ThursdayThe family of a 19-year-old Palestinian-American man who they say was shot dead by an Israeli settler in the occupied West Bank have called for accountability over his killing.Nasrallah Abu Siyam was shot near the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, becoming at least the sixth American citizen killed by Israeli settlers or soldiers in the territory in the last two years. The Trump administration said it stood ready to provide consular assistance, but did not respond to claims its policies had failed to stem a surge in settler violence.The Israeli embassy in Washington said the incident was under review and an \"operational inquiry... must be completed as soon as possible\".Abu Siyam was a US citizen born in Philadelphia.His family said he was among approximately 30 residents of the village of Mukhmas who were trying to stop armed settlers from stealing their goats on Wednesday. As both residents and settlers threw stones, said one witness, settlers shot at least three of the villagers, including Abu Siyam, who was struck fatally. Abdulhamid Siyam, cousin to Abu Siyam, told the BBC that the 19-year-old's death was a \"big loss\" and the actions of settlers in the West Bank had gone unchecked.\"A young man of 19 shot and killed in this cold blood and no responsibility, impunity completely,\" he said.The Trump administration has faced criticism from rights groups for lifting Biden-era sanctions on violent settlers, who have rarely faced criminal punishments from Israeli authorities. The US State Department said it was aware of the death of a US citizen and was \"carefully monitoring the situation\". On Saturday it released an updated statement saying it extends \"deepest condolences\" to the family of the victim and expects \"a full, thorough, and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death\". It added the US embassy in Jerusalem had been in direct contact with the family to provide assistance.A spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said that soldiers had attended the scene and used \"riot dispersal means to restore order\". \"No IDF fire  was reported during the course of the incident,\" the IDF statement said. The spokesperson confirmed that the incident was under review, and said \"a continuous military presence\" would remain in the area in the coming days to prevent further incidents.",

    "body": "7 hours agoGeorge WrightGetty ImagesAn armed man has been shot dead after entering the secure perimeter of US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the Secret Service has said.The man was carrying a shotgun and fuel can when he was stopped and shot by Secret Service agents and a Sheriff's deputy, authorities said.The incident happened around 01:30 ET (06:30 GMT) on Sunday morning, when the president was in Washington DC. The suspect has been named as Austin T Martin of Cameron, North Carolina, according to the BBC's US partner CBS.His family in North Carolina had reported him missing in the early hours of Sunday morning, the Moore County Sheriff's Office said in a statement to the BBC. The missing persons information has since been turned over to federal authorities, the sheriff's office said.They added that the department had no prior history involving Martin and it was not involved in the Florida investigation.Officials are looking into whether he bought the gun along the driving route he took from North Carolina to Florida, according to CBS.Secret Service agents fired at him after they saw him \"unlawfully entering the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early this morning\", agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi posted on X.The suspect \"was observed by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can\", the agency said in a statement.The man was then shot after refusing orders, Palm Beach County sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.\"The only words that we said to him was 'drop the items' which means the gas can and the shotgun,\" Bradshaw told a news conference. \"At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,\" he said. At that point, agents fired their weapons to \"neutralise the threat\", he said.FacebookThe suspect had been reported missing by relatives, according to CBSThe officers were wearing body cameras and no law enforcement officers were injured, he added.Bradshaw said that he does not know if the suspect's gun was loaded, and that will form part of an investigation, which the FBI will be assisting in.US Secret Service Director Sean Curran travelled to Florida on Sunday for \"after-actions\" and has \"reinvigorated operational communication and agency response to critical incidents\", the agency said in a post on X. Security at Mar-a-Lago is extremely tight, with an outer cordon of local Palm Beach sheriffs and an inner one maintained by the Secret Service. Visitors are searched, and cars and bags are swept by dogs and metal detectors.Trump has been the target of several assassination plots or attempts.In July 2024, Trump was shot in the ear as he stood in front of crowds in Butler, Pennsylvania. One bystander was killed and two were injured in the shooting. The shooter, 20-year-old Matthew Crooks, was immediately shot and killed by security forces and his motive remains unknown.Months later, a US Secret Service agent spotted a rifle sticking out of bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The man, later identified as Ryan Routh, fled but was caught. The 59-year-old was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month for attempting to assassinate the president.During an appearance on Fox Business after the fatal incident, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blamed the the political left for \"normalising\" political violence,  citing the two attempts on Trump's life in 2024,\"Two would-be assassins dead, one in jail for life, and this venom coming from the other side,\" Bessent said, adding: \"They are normalising this violence. It's got to stop.\"",

    "body": "18 hours agoOttilie MitchellandYama Bariz,BBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIslamabad said the strikes were launched on Afghanistan following recent suicide bombings in PakistanPakistan has carried out multiple overnight air strikes on Afghanistan, which the Taliban has said killed at least 18 people, including women and children.Islamabad said the attacks targeted seven alleged militant camps and hideouts near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and that they had been launched after recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.Afghanistan condemned the attacks, saying they targeted multiple civilian homes and a religious school. The fresh strikes come after the two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in October following deadly cross-border clashes, though subsequent fighting has taken place.The Taliban's defence ministry said the strikes targeted civilian areas of Nangarhar and Paktika provinces and had killed dozens of people.In Girdi Kas village, in the Bihsud district of Nangarhar, a man named Shahabuddin told reporters while pointing at his destroyed house that of 23 members of his family, only five had survived the attack. Local Taliban spokesman Sayed Taib Hamd said that 18 members of the family had been killed.The BBC had earlier been told about 20 people were thought to have died. No deaths have been reported so far in the other areas hit. A guesthouse and a religious school were targeted in the Bermal and Urgun districts of Paktika province, but they were empty at the time of the attacks, local officials and locals told the BBC.AFP via Getty ImagesHouses were also destroyed in Balish village in the Urgun district of Paktika province (pictured)Pakistan's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said it had carried out \"intelligence based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts\".In a statement on X, it said the targets included members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, which the government refers to as \"Fitna al Khawarij,\" along with their affiliates and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province.The ministry described the strikes as \"a retributive response\" to recent suicide bombings in Pakistan by terror groups it said were sheltered by Kabul.The recent attacks in Pakistan included one on a Shia mosque in the capital Islamabad earlier this month, as well as others that took place since the holy month of Ramadan began this week in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Pakistan accused the Afghan Taliban of failing to take action against the militants, adding that it had \"conclusive evidence\" that the attacks were carried out by militants on the instructions of their leadership in Afghanistan.The Taliban's defence ministry later posted on X condemning the attacks as a \"blatant violation of Afghanistan's territorial integrity\", adding that they were a \"clear breach of international law\".It warned that \"an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time\", adding that \"attacks on civilian targets and religious institutions indicate the failure of Pakistan's army in intelligence and security.\"The strikes come days after Saudi Arabia mediated the release of three Pakistani soldiers earlier this week, who were captured in Kabul during border clashes last October.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border.",

    "body": "18 hours agoMaia DaviesReutersMike Huckabee, pictured in September, has long been a supporter of IsraelArab and Muslim governments have condemned remarks made by the US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel would be justified in taking over a vast stretch of the Middle East on Biblical grounds.In an interview with conservative US commentator Tucker Carlson, Huckabee was asked whether Israel had a right to an area which the host said was, according to the Bible, \"essentially the entire Middle East\".The ambassador said \"it would be fine if it took it all\". But he added Israel was not seeking to do so, rather it is \"asking to at least take the land that they now occupy\" and protect its people.In a joint statement, more than a dozen governments including Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates called the comments \"dangerous and inflammatory\", and a threat to efforts to end the war in Gaza.In the interview, released on Friday, Carlson pressed the ambassador on his interpretation of a Bible verse which the host claimed suggested Israel had a right to the land between the River Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.Huckabee said \"it would be a big piece of land\" but stressed that \"I don't think that's what we're talking about here today\".He later added: \"They're not asking to go back to take all of that, but they are asking to at least take the land that they now occupy, they now live in, they now own legitimately, and it is a safe haven for them.\"He also said his earlier remark that Israel could take it \"all\" had been somewhat \"hyperbolic\".Following the interview's release, the UAE's foreign ministry released the statement  on behalf of various governments and other actors expressing \"strong condemnation and profound concern\" regarding the comments.The statement said Huckabee had \"indicated that it would be acceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the occupied West Bank\".It said the remarks violated international law and directly contradicted US President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, including efforts to create \"a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state\".The statement continued: \"The ministries reaffirmed that Israel has no sovereignty whatsoever over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands.\"\"They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states.\"The statement said it was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.Huckabee has frequently expressed his support for Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank, contradicting decades of US policy.Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in 2024.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that the court had made a \"decision of lies\" and insisted that \"the Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land\".Successive Israeli governments have allowed settlements to grow. However, expansion has risen sharply since Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the head of a right-wing, pro-settler coalition, as well as the start of the Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's deadly 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's subsequent military offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

Uganda's government has not responded to these allegations.President Museveni summarised his meeting with Dagalo in a previous statement, saying: \"As always, I emphasised that dialogue and a peaceful political solution are the only sustainable paths to stability for Sudan and the region.\"Sudan remains locked in an almost three‑year power struggle between the regular army and the RSF. The civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, forced more than 13 million people from their homes and sparked widespread famine.Both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces have been accused of atrocities.Throughout the war, Sudan's government has criticised regional states for hosting RSF leaders.Kenya insisted it had hosted the meetings in a bid to find a way to end the war, \"without any ulterior motives\".But the conflict shows no signs of waning - on Saturday, the RSF announced it had seized the town of al-Tina in North Darfur, after days of intense fighting.The RSF shared a video of its fighters celebrating under a sign bearing the town's name.

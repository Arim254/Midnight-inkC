    "body": "3 hours agoCaroline Hawley,Diplomatic CorrespondentandAlys Davies,BBC NewsA member of Iran's security forces was killed during a fourth day of protests in the country, which have been sparked by a currency collapse, the semi-official Fars news agency has reported.Citing regional official Said Pourali, Fars said the incident happened in the city of Kouhdasht, in the western Lorestan province, adding that a number of members of the security forces were also injured.Footage verified by BBC Persian appears to show security forces firing at protesters in the city on the same day.Confrontations were also reported in the southern province of Fars and the western provinces of Hamedan and Lorestan on Thursday.The authorities in the capital, Tehran, had declared Wednesday a bank holiday - in an apparent effort to quell the unrest, which started in the capital on Sunday.The Fars report said a 21-year-old member of the Basij - a paramilitary force linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards - was killed during a confrontation in the city of Kouhdasht. Thirteen police officers and Basij members had been injured by stone throwing, the report said. Unrest broke out in other cities too.In the southern province of Fars, protesters tried to break into a local government building, with officials reporting three police officers injured and four people arrested in the city of Fasa.In video that emerged on social media and verified by the BBC, a crowd is filmed breaking the gate of the governor's office in the city.Then, in another post, security men are seen shooting in response. Clouds of tear gas rise in front of shuttered shops.Across the country, schools, universities and public institutions were closed because of the last-minute public holiday announced by the Iranian government.It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "Three hikers, including a 19-year-old who fell approximately 500 feet (150m), have been found dead on Mt Baldy, a looming snow-capped mountain known to be one of the most dangerous to climb in Southern California.Rescue workers found Marcus Alexander Muench Casanova, 19, dead and discovered two other dead hikers during the search, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.The other two hikers were not hiking with the teenager, and it is not clear how long they had been deceased on the mountain.Casanova went hiking on 29 December with a friend who was able to call for help after the teen fell. The friend had to hike away from the fall site near the Devil's Backbone trail to an area with cell reception and provided their GPS location to rescue crews, authorities said. That companion was unharmed.Due to high winds, emergency crews were unable to complete a recovery operation by helicopter on Monday, but were able to recover the bodies on Tuesday.The sheriff's office said it had rescued five other hikers from the mountain in the previous five days.\"We are destroyed by the loss of our beloved Marcus,\" his family said in a statement on Wednesday. The statement described the California native as an \"avid sailor and outdoorsman\".Rising 10,064 feet (3068m) in the San Gabriel Mountains, Mt Baldy – officially known as Mt San Antonio – has become one of the deadliest peaks in the United States.More than 14 people have died on the mountain since 2020, including British actor Julian Sands in January 2023, although his remains were not found until five months later. More than 100 people have been rescued from the mountain since 2020.Proximity to Los Angeles means Mt Baldy attracts experienced and inexperienced climbers, and authorities urged people to stay off the mountain, especially during such unpredictable winter weather.\"It is one of the most dangerous trails we have here in our area,\" Jenny Smith, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, said of the Devil's Backbone trail during a news conference. \"We don't want novice hikers going up and hurting themselves.\"Southern California has been blanketed in rain and snow over the last week, but on 29 December, when the teen went hiking, the sun was shining, and the skies were blue with unusually clear visibility across the region.Mt Baldy was visible across Southern California, with breathtaking views from as far away as Catalina Island.The weather can change quickly on Mt Baldy, and conditions can be treacherous with snow and ice. Climbers venturing along the Devil's Backbone trail are advised to carry crampons and ice axes.Trails on the mountain have been temporarily closed until the new year following the deaths and the repeated rescue responses.",

    "description": "Finnish police have detained a vessel sailing from Russia, which is suspected of damaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia ",
    "body": "Finnish police have detained a vessel sailing from Russia, which is suspected of damaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland.The cargo vessel, the Fitburg, was sailing from St Petersburg to the port of Haifa in Israel, under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.All 14 crew members were arrested after the cable owned by Finnish telecoms operator Elisa was damaged. The operator said in a statement that the damage had \"not affected the functionality of Elisa's services in any way\", and its services had been re-routed.The Baltic Sea has seen a series of incidents in recent years in which underwater cables have been damaged or completely cut.Many experts and political leaders have viewed the recent incidents as part of a \"hybrid war\" carried out by Russia against Western countries. The issue has come under increased focus since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Police said they were investigating \"aggravated disruption of telecommunications\" and \"aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage\".The detained crew members were Russian, Georgian, Kazakh and Azerbaijani, police added.Undersea cables carry crucial electricity and data between countries, and keep people connected to the internet.On Wednesday morning, the Finnish authorities sent a helicopter and a patrol ship to the area, where they found the vessel was dragging its anchor in the sea, Finland's coastguard said.They said they had \"launched operations this morning to investigate the suspected cable damage\" after telecoms provider Elisa detected a fault.Finnish police said the authorities had \"taken control of the vessel as part of a joint operation\".\"At this stage, the police are investigating the incident as aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications,\" the police added.\"Finland is prepared for security challenges of various kinds, and we respond to them as necessary,\" Finnish President Alexander Stubb said in a statement on social media. At a press conference, police were asked by journalists if the cable was damaged on behalf of another country, local media reported.Police Chief Ilkka Koskimäki replied that \"the police or other authorities do not speculate on these matters. The police's job is to investigate what happened.\"Eight Nato countries, and Russia, border the Baltic Sea - Finland, Estonia, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden.Estonia's government said a second telecoms cable connecting it to Finland also suffered an outage on Wednesday. The country's President Alar Karis said \"hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify\".The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen posted on X, adding that it was prepared to counter \"hybrid threats\".\"We're already talking about national security. Critical infrastructure is the front line,\" the Finnish MP Jarno Limnell commented on the incident, in a post on X.Nato has identified deep-sea cables as part of the world's critical infrastructure and previously warned that adversaries could exploit them through sabotage or hybrid warfare, threatening both civilian and military communications.\"Hybrid warfare\" includes underwater sabotage, anonymous cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, and non-military tactics to destabilise adversaries.In December 2024, Finnish police said they were investigating whether a Russian ship was involved in the sabotage of an electricity cable running between Finland and Estonia.A month earlier, the German government said damage to two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea looked like an act of sabotage. A cable between Finland and Germany was cut, as well as another cable between Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland Island. ",

    "body": "A worker at Walt Disney World is \"recovering\" after being injured by a 400-lb (180kg) runaway fake boulder prop in an incident that was caught on video, the Florida theme park confirmed. The incident took place at the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! during a live recreation of a famous scene from the film.Video shows the boulder rolling towards the audience as a staff member jumps into its path, preventing it from reaching the crowd.\"We're focused on supporting our cast member, who is recovering,\" Disney said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Safety is at the heart of what we do, and that element of the show will be modified as our safety team completes a review of what happened.\"The scene from 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark shows Indiana Jones - played by Harrison Ford - outrunning a giant boulder triggered by a booby trap, before leaping to safety.Video of the incident on Tuesday shows the boulder bouncing off its tracks, and then bounding towards the audience as a staff member steps into its path and is knocked to the ground.The staff member did not appear to stand up immediately, and other workers are seen running to his side.According to a blog run by the park, the boulder prop is approximately 400-lbs and made of rubber. A spokesperson for Disney did not confirm that the boulder was the cause of the incident, but told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that \"a prop moved off its track\".One witness told People magazine that the worker had \"saved\" the audience from being injured. \"It was a crazy experience and definitely one that we will remember.\"In one video of the incident, a man behind the camera is heard saying: \"He literally saved our lives, that guy.\"",

It said that 20 ambulances had attended the scene and that injured people had been transferred to medical facilities in the nearby city of Cusco.The US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured in the crash, while the UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\".Getty ImagesOne of the two trains affected in the collisionLocal media outlet Peru21 reports that hundreds of tourists remain at the scene awaiting evacuation, which has been hampered by difficult terrain around the crash site.At least 20 of the injured are in a serious condition, a health official told the Reuters news agency. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes. The two trains involved in the accident were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident. The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear. The crash comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process. The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative due to its limited accessibility. Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World. Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator. In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about overtourism.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoBen TobiasWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireSeveral dozen people are presumed to have died and more than 100 injured following a fire in a ski resort in southern Switzerland, officials have said.Police said several nationalities were likely involved in the New Year's Day fire, which happened at 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) in a bar called Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana. It is being treated as a fire and there is \"no question\" of an attack, the region's chief prosecutor said.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117Here's what we know so far. How many people were killed?At a news conference on Thursday morning police said \"several dozen\" people were presumed to have died in the fire, although it was too early to give a precise number. The Italian foreign ministry - citing Swiss police - said it believed around 40 people had died. Follow live updatesAround 100 people have been injured, mostly with severe burns, Swiss officials said. Most have been taken to Valais hospital where the intensive care unit is now full, according to local authorities. Ten helicopters, 40 ambulances and 150 emergency workers were sent to the scene. Work is ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, the region's chief-prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said.The Italian ambassador to Switzerland says it could take weeks to identify the dead. Earlier, Italy's foreign minister said identification would be difficult due to the severe burns. People from several countries are believed to be involved and French media has reported that at least two of the injured are French nationals. French President Emmanuel Macron has offered \"the full solidarity of France and our fraternal support\" to Switzerland. The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.Video shows Swiss ski resort bar on fireWhat caused the fire? The cause of the fire is unknown but Ms Pilloud said it is currently being treated as a fire and \"at no time is there a question of any attack\". Police initially said there had been an explosion, but have since referred to it as a fire and have said it is too early to speculate on the cause. Asked about the reports of an explosion, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer said it \"is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises\".Local reports had also suggested pyrotechnics could have been involved. The regional police commander Frédéric Gisler said smoke was first seen emanating from a bar at around 01:30 local time, at which point emergency services were called. The first police officers were quickly on the scene followed by a major deployment of rescue teams, Mr Gisler said. What do we know about Le Constellation bar? Le Constellation is a large bar in the the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana which has been around for many years. Although the resort itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reported from the resort.Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were likely drinking and dancing. It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts, and it is likely the bar was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating the start of 2026. Police Cantonale ValaisannePolice have released images from inside the bar after the fire showing chairs and benches strewn across the room",

    "body": "1 day agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesTatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy, has died aged 35.Her family announced her death in a social media post shared by the John F Kennedy Library Foundation, writing: \"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts.\"In November, Schlossberg, a climate journalist, announced her diagnosis of an aggressive form of cancer. She said in an essay that she had been given less than a year to live.Schlossberg was the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy, and is survived by her husband George Moran and their two children, three-year-old Edwin and one-year-old Josephine.In an article published last month in The New Yorker titled, \"A Battle With My Blood,\" Schlossberg revealed she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in May 2024, after giving birth to her second child.\"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me,\" she wrote.Schlossberg described the treatments she received, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, but shared that doctors did not give her a good prognosis.She also wrote of the pain she feared her passing would cause for her family, which has endured multiple personal tragedies. Her grandfather, President Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963 and her uncle, John F Kennedy Jr, died in a plane crash in 1999. Her younger brother, Jack Schlossberg, is running for Congress in New York.\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" Schlossberg wrote.\"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she said.In her essay, Schlossberg also expressed disappointment in her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's appointment to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Another relative, Maria Shriver, a journalist and the former first lady of California, paid tribute to her \"sweet, beloved Tatiana\" as someone who \"loved her life\".\"She created a beautiful life with her extraordinary husband George, and children Eddie and Josie. She fought like a warrior. She was valiant, strong, courageous.\"\"Tatiana was a great journalist, and she used her words to educate others about the earth and how to save it\", Shriver wrote on Instagram.AFP via Getty ImagesPrince William, Jack Schlossberg, Tatiana Schlossberg and Caroline Kennedy pictured in 2022 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in BostonBefore her widely-read essay about her diagnosis, Schlossberg forged a successful career as a climate journalist.Schlossberg authored the book \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have\". She also wrote about climate and other beats for the New York Times.In December 2021, she reported on local experiments to harness the energy of the London Underground to provide heat to homes, in an effort to fight climate change.\"I think climate change is the biggest story in the world, and it's a story about everything,\" she told NBC News in 2019. \"It's about science and nature, but it's also about politics and health and business. To me, looking at this as a journalist, it seemed like a really important story to tell.\"\"And if I could help communicate about it, that might inspire other people to get involved and work on the issue,\" she said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterUS Southern CommandA screengrab from a video posted by US Southern Command shows a small vessel in the sea with what appears to be debris floating nearby.The US military says it struck two boats it alleges were carrying drugs on Wednesday, killing five people on board.US Southern Command did not say where it had carried out the latest strikes but US forces have been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics to the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific for the past three months. Wednesday's strike came a day after the US targeted what it said were \"three narco-trafficking vessels travelling as a convoy\", killing at least three people.The Trump administration has cast its operations as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September. That first attack has come under particular scrutiny from lawmakers in Washington since it emerged that US forces struck the targeted boat twice.Two people who had survived the first strike and were clinging to the hull of their boat were killed in the second. Some lawmakers expressed concern that the \"double-tap\" strike breached the rules of engagement. In its post announcing the strike on a convoy of three boats carried out on 30 December, US Southern Command said that there had been a number of survivors, without specifying how many.It said that \"the remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels\". It added that the US Coast Guard had been \"immediately notified\" to search for the survivors.Reuters news agency reports that it was told by a US official who asked to remain anonymous that eight survivors were being searched for.It is not yet clear if any of them have been found. The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs but in its most recent post, Southern Command again insisted that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

Praying for strength and guidance for all their family, friends and of course AJ during this very difficult time.\"Ghami was Joshua's full-time sport and exercise rehabilitation coach and worked with him for more than 10 years.Moment Anthony Joshua is taken out of carSpeaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Ogun State police spokesperson Oluseyi Babaseyi said \"investigations are still ongoing\" and described the process as \"still discreet\".The Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Agency (TRACE) in Ogun state, where the accident occurred, has said preliminary investigations showed the vehicle had burst a tyre before crashing into the truck.Joshua, who was born in Watford to Nigerian parents, was on holiday in Nigeria after his win over Jake Paul in Miami on 19 December.Earlier, Tony Bellew, the retired cruiserweight world champion, posted on X: \"Thoughts and prayers to the families of these men. Tragic losses in horrific circumstances!\"I hope he (Joshua) is able to process this with time because there is no pain in life worse than grief.\"Two-time undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk and British former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury also posted Instagram stories to offer condolences.More on this story",

    "body": "14 hours agoNick ThorpeCentral Europe correspondentBulgaria - the poorest country in the European Union - has become the 21st member of the eurozone - leapfrogging more obvious and prosperous candidates like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.For mostly urban, young and entrepreneurial Bulgarians, it's an optimistic and  potentially lucrative leap - the final move in a game which has brought Bulgaria into the European mainstream - from Nato and EU membership, to joining the Schengen zone, and now the euro.For the older, rural, more conservative parts of the population, the replacement of the Bulgarian lev by the euro provokes fear and resentment.The lev - meaning lion - has been the Bulgarian currency since 1881, but it has been pegged to other European currencies since 1997 - first the Deutschmark, then the euro.Opinion polls put Bulgaria's 6.5 million population more or less equally divided on the new currency, and political turmoil is not making the transition easy. Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government lost a confidence vote on 11 December, after mass protests against the 2026 budget. Bulgaria has held seven elections in the past four years - an eighth looks likely early next year.\"I don't want the euro, and I don't like the way it has been imposed on us,\" Todor, 50, a small business owner in the central town of Gabrovo, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, told the BBC. \"If there were a referendum, I reckon 70% of the people would vote against it.\" A referendum on euro adoption was proposed by President Rumen Radev but rejected by the outgoing government. Todor's business, producing coloured plastics for the domestic market, had a bad  year because of high inflation, he said, and a fall in sales fuelled, he believed, by fear of the euro.Ognian Enev, 60, who owns a tea shop in central Sofia, was more enthusiastic. \"On the whole, it's a good thing. It's just a technical change. It doesn't bother me,\" he told the BBC. In any case, he pointed out, people who bought flats or cars until now have got used to prices marked in euros. The 1.2 million Bulgarians who live outside the country have also been sending money home for years in euros.Like many shopkeepers, Ognian has the new currency ready, in coins and small denomination notes, ready for the transition. Throughout January, you can pay in both lev and euros, but change is supposed to be in euros. From 1 February, it will no longer be permitted to pay in lev. He hopes joining the single currency will be good for trade - many of his flavoured and fruit teas come from sellers in the eurozone, while the more expensive, high-end teas are imported direct from China and Japan.Since August 2025, all shops in Bulgaria have been required by law to display prices in both currencies. Conveniently, €1 is worth about two lev (1.95583 to be exact). In response to public fears that prices will be rounded up, elaborate watchdogs have been created, to protect consumers. And some prices have been rounded down: the cost of public transport in the capital Sofia is due to fall slightly.The design on the reverse side of the new eurocoins was chosen to overcome worries that Bulgaria is losing its sovereignty. St Ivan of Rila is on the €1 coin, Paisius of Hilendar, an 18th Century monk and champion of the national revival, is on the €2 coin. The smaller denomination eurocents carry an image of the Madara rider, a symbol of early Bulgarian statehood, based on an 8th Century rock relief.Just how the new currency will impact Bulgaria as a whole, concerns everyone. The lessons from other countries offer two versions - the successful \"Baltic model\" followed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which combined the euro with reforms to streamline administration, encourage investment and combat corruption. And the \"Italian model\", where years of stagnation followed.\"I'm afraid we'll be more like Italy,\" Ognian Enev predicted.",

    "body": "1 day agoKelly NgandJonathan Head,South East Asia Correspondent, BangkokThailand has released 18 Cambodian soldiers that were captured in July during deadly border clashes as part of a ceasefire the two countries agreed to on Saturday.The handover was delayed by a day over Thai concerns over alleged violations of the ceasefire, but took place after sustained Chinese diplomatic pressure to ensure the deal holds.Simmering tensions along the Thailand-Cambodia border exploded early this month and went on for weeks, forcing nearly one million people from their homes.Saturday's deal had seen both sides agree to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements, and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible. The 18 Cambodian soldiers, dressed in civilian clothes, were greeted by well-wishers as they were escorted over a border checkpoint and handed to the Cambodian authorities. Their captivity since July - during an earlier round of deadly clashes - has inflamed nationalist sentiment in Cambodia, their release being one of the main demands of its government in the ceasefire talks with Thailand.On Wednesday, Thailand's foreign ministry said the release of the soldiers was a \"demonstration of goodwill\" and that it hoped Cambodia would \"reciprocate this goodwill through its concrete actions\".Cambodia confirmed the return of its troops, with its defence ministry saying it \"remains hopeful\" that this will help build \"mutual trust and confidence\".One of the terms of the ceasefire was that the 18 soldiers had to be handed over within 72 hours - by noon local time on Tuesday. But this was delayed after Bangkok accused Phnom Penh of violating the truce by flying more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles into Thailand on Sunday.Despite Thailand's complaints, the latest ceasefire appears to be holding so far.Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May. Then in July, five days of intense fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.The two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in July and signed it in October, brokered by US President Donald Trump. But the ceasefire collapsed when fresh tensions erupted early this month, with both sides accusing the other over the breakdown.",

    "body": "Jailed HK tycoon's 'teeth rotting and fingernails falling off', daughter tells BBC1 day agoDanny VincentandKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesJimmy Lai is seen here in a 2020 photo taken months before he went to jailThe daughter of Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy tycoon jailed in Hong Kong, has expressed concerns about her father's deteriorating health in prison, saying that his fingernails \"sometimes fall off\" and his teeth are rotting.Lai, 78, has been detained since December 2020 and faces life in prison. Earlier this month he was convicted of colluding with foreign forces under the city's controversial national security law (NSL).Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have denied that Lai has been mistreated in prison, saying he is in \"good health\".The BBC has seen a letter written by Lai's family urging UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to call for Lai's release when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping next month.His daughter Claire Lai, who is in exile in London, told the BBC that she fears she \"may never see him again\".\"Of course I worry that my father is going to be a martyr, and I don't want him to be a martyr. But I would not be here today, I would not be speaking out if I didn't think this was his best chance of reuniting with our family.\"She described her father as an \"extremely robust and strong man\" when he went to prison, but said over the last year he has \"lost a significant amount of weight\".\"He is diabetic, he has heart issues which he never had in the past. He has fingernails that turn purplish grey and sometimes fall off. He has teeth that are rotting.\"He has back and waist pains. Some days it's painful for him to stand. Sometimes he can't stand. And some days he can't even get out of bed.\"Lai's family has, on multiple occasions, flagged concerns about his deteriorating health. Lai's son, Sebastien, told the BBC earlier this year that his father's \"body is breaking down\".A spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong stated earlier this month that Lai's \"lawful rights and interests have been fully protected, and he is in good health\".They added that \"a safe, humane, appropriate, and healthy custodial environment in accordance with the law\" has been provided for Lai.Claire Lai is on a campaign to get her father released from prisonLai, a UK citizen, is the most prominent person to be charged under the NSL, introduced in 2020 in response to massive pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.Beijing defends the law as necessary to maintain stability in Hong Kong, but critics say it has effectively outlawed dissent.Lai was accused of lobbying foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. He was also found guilty under a separate colonial-era law of publishing seditious material in his now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper.After Lai's conviction earlier this month, the UK condemned it as \"politically motivated persecution\", saying that he had been \"targeted... for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression\".\"The UK has repeatedly called for the National Security Law to be repealed and for an end to the prosecution of all individuals charged under it,\" the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said.In their statement earlier this month, Chinese authorities said Western attempts \"to influence judicial verdicts through political pressure blatantly trample on the spirit of the rule of law and fully expose their hypocritical 'double standards'. The Chinese side firmly opposes this.\"Starmer's trip to China in late January 2026 will be the first by a UK Prime Minister since 2018.",

    "body": "7 hours agoLaura Gozzi,KyivandJames ChaterUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said a peace agreement to end the war with Russia is \"90% ready\", in a New Year address that largely focused on resistance to Moscow's full-scale invasion.Zelensky said the remaining 10% of the agreement to end nearly four years of conflict would \"determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe\".In his own New Year speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his troops that \"we believe in you and our victory\".Earlier on Wednesday, Moscow also released what it said was evidence of Ukraine using drones to target Putin's private home on Lake Valdai in north-west Russia, allegations Kyiv has strenuously denied. It included a map allegedly showing that the drones were launched from the Sumy and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine and a video of a downed drone lying in snowy woodland. A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot.Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.In his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow secure full control of the industrial area in any peace agreement. Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said. At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates. Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".On Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming - and which the alleged drone incident over Putin's residence may have pushed further into the distance.

We want people to be safe in our community,\" he added.British tourists Joe and Lucy said the increased police presence reassured them. The pair - who timed their Australia trip to coincide with the fireworks - were in Melbourne when the shooting occurred.\"We had our worries about coming for New Year's Eve,\" Joe told the BBC, adding, \"but we were reading more recently in the news... how more police were going to be here, it would be a bit safer\".Separately, Minns had urged Sydneysiders to not let the \"horrible criminal terrorist event\" at Bondi change the way they live, as he called on people to \"show defiance\" and celebrate the new year.This sentiment was shared by some of the spectators.Out among the crowds at Barangaroo's Observatory Hill, a close spot to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, was Hélène from Belgium.She told the BBC people \"cannot live in fear\" following the attack.Hours ahead of the countdown, hundreds of thousands of people flocked towards the harbour, with many official viewing areas filling to capacity by early evening.On the harbour, sailboats dotted the water - one of the best spots to watch the midnight fireworks display.Sydney's celebration - with its iconic fireworks display - kicked off a chain of events, from Dubai, to London and New York.Getty ImagesArmed police carrying assault rifles patrol outside the Sydney Opera House",

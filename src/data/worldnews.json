    "body": "15 hours agoTabby WilsonLuca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoAn Italian mayor has apologised to the family of opera star Luciano Pavarotti after the town of Pesaro encased a statue honouring the late singer within a Christmas ice rink. The singer's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, told local media that she was \"angry and upset\" at what she called the decision to \"ridicule\" her late husband. The temporary ice rink was constructed in the centre of the town's piazza, leaving Pavrotti's statue knee-deep in ice and surrounded by perspex walls. In response, Mayor Andrea Biancani said that he didn't mean to offend anyone, and admitted that his council had \"made a mistake\".Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoBefore it was opened on 29 November, Biancani posted a doctored image of Pavarotti's statue playing ice hockey with the hashtag #DaiUnCinqueAPavarotti, which translates to \"Give a high-five to Pavarotti\".\"I didn't expect a town would allow this treatment of the memory and the image of a person who made Italy great around the world,\" Ms Mantovani told local outlet Il Resto del Carlino. She accused the council of making a \"poorly executed, absurd decision\". The life-size bronze statue was officially unveiled in Pesaro in April 2024, with Ms Mantovani and the couple's daughter, Alice, in attendance. The couple often holidayed in Pesaro, where Pavarotti had a villa and was an honorary citizen.Alamy/Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoOpera star Luciano Pavarotti's statue seen earlier in the year in the town of Pesaro (left), and in November, surrounded by an ice rink (right).Biancini told Il Resto del Carlino, which nicknamed the incident \"Pavarotti on Ice\", that when plans for the ice rink were initially presented to him, he was assured that the Pavarotti statue would not be touched and that it was only later that he found out designers had been forced to alter their construction. He said it would not be possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this late stage, but insisted that it would \"not happen again\".Pavarotti was an Italian tenor, and is widely known as one of the most successful opera stars of all time.His performances in the Three Tenors concerts were seen around the world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.His final performance was at the opening of the Winter Olympics in Turin in February 2006.He died the following year at the age of 71, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Pavarotti left behind four daughters from his two marriages. Ms Mantovani was his second wife. She remarried, to financial advisor Alberto Tinarelli, in 2020. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoDavid GrittenReutersPope Leo said he was \"deeply moved\" by his visit to the site of the Beirut port blastPope Leo XIV led a silent prayer at the site of the Beirut port explosion and demanded justice for its victims, as he wrapped up his three-day visit to Lebanon.He also met some relatives of the 218 people who were killed by the massive blast on 4 August 2020, which devastated a large part of the capital.Later, the Pope said he was \"deeply moved\" by his visit to the port and shared \"the thirst for truth and justice, of so many families, of an entire country\".No-one has yet been held accountable for the disaster, which happened when a fire triggered the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely at a port warehouse for almost six years.It is widely believed that officials and politicians were aware of the combustible chemical's existence and the danger it posed but that they failed to secure, remove or destroy it.Victims' relatives and activists say the domestic investigation into the disaster has been hampered by the political leadership's efforts to shield those responsible from scrutiny.Cecile Roukoz, whose brother Joseph was killed, said the Pope's visit to the memorial was \"very important\". \"We know that he raises his voice for justice, and we need justice for our brothers and all the victims of this explosion,\" she added.Tatiana Hasrouty, who lost her father Ghassan in the blast, said: \"He's trying to help us find the truth in some sort of way, in his way, maybe in praying and maybe in just looking at us... We, the families, now, after five years, we need people to look at us.\"EPAAn estimated 150,000 people gathered at Beirut's waterfront for the Pope's final Mass in LebanonAfter praying at the blast site, the Pope celebrated the final Mass of his trip in front of an estimated 150,000 people gathered on Beirut's waterfront.Addressing the crowd, he lamented that the beauty of Lebanon had been \"overshadowed by poverty and suffering, the wounds that have marked your history\".But he appealed to the country's diverse communities to unite to solve its problems.\"Let us cast off the armour of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\" he said. \"A Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognise each other as brothers and sisters.\"Returning to Rome on Tuesday, the Pope told reporters that Lebanon was an example of \"a land where Islam and Christianity are both present and are respected\".He later added: \"I think those are lessons that would be important to be heard in Europe or North America - that we should perhaps be a little less fearful, and look at ways of promoting authentic dialogue and respect.\"Since the last papal visit in 2012, Lebanon has been plagued by multiple crises.In 2019, the country suffered one of the worst economic depressions recorded in modern times, which pushed millions into poverty.It was followed by mass anti-government protests, the coronavirus pandemic, and then the Beirut port explosion.Political paralysis prevented the country from passing the economic and structural reforms demanded by foreign donors in return for billions of dollars in aid.Lebanon was later devastated by the 13-month war between the Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement and Israel, which killed 4,000 Lebanese and 120 Israelis.A ceasefire ended the conflict a year ago, but Israel has continued to attack targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, accusing the Iran-backed group of trying to rearm.Additional reporting by Aleem Maqbool",

    "description": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor ",
    "body": "A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as top federal prosecutor for New Jersey - a ruling likely to affect scores of criminal cases in the state.The president handpicked Habba for the role of US attorney this year, but a district court rejected her nomination, so the Trump administration installed her in a role that allowed her to fill in on an acting basis.The appellate judges found on Monday that this tactic, which bypassed confirmation by the US Senate, violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Habba is the second Trump-appointed prosecutor to be disqualified in recent weeks.\"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" one of the appellate judges, Judge Michael Fisher, wrote in Monday's ruling disqualifying Habba. The BBC has contacted Habba's office, the White House, and the Department of Justice for comment. In a joint statement, three lawyers who had challenged Habba's authority - Abbe David Lowell, Gerry Krovatin, and Norm Eisen - wrote that this marks \"the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions\".The statement continued: \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported US Attorneys wherever appropriate.\"Habba, 41, first joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. She went on to represent Trump in his hush-money trial in New York last year, when he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction. Before Habba took on the role of US Attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as \"unwavering in her loyalty\" and a \"tireless advocate for justice\".Monday's ruling may force the justice department to find a new prosecutor to supervise federal criminal cases in New Jersey. The appellate court's decision came after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey argued that the prosecutor's appointment was unlawful, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.A federal judge ruled in their favour in August. That order had been on hold while the appeals court heard the case. Habba is not the first Trump-appointed US prosecutor to face a legal challenge. A federal judge last week dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that the US attorney in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed as interim US attorney in Virginia. In October, a US district judge disqualified Bill Essayli from his role as acting US attorney for the Southern District of California, finding that he had stayed in the temporary post longer than the law allowed. But the judge allowed Essayli to continue overseeing the office - the most populous US federal judicial district, serving around 19 million people - in his role as first assistant US attorney. Defence attorneys have filed a motion to get that part of the judge's ruling reversed in an attempt to fully oust Essayli. In September, another US district judge disqualified Nevada's lead federal prosecutor Sigal Chattah, finding that she, too, was not lawfully serving as acting US attorney. ",

    "body": "22 hours agoMadeline HalpertandNada Tawfik,North America correspondentLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan a year ago this week, appeared in court on Monday as his lawyers challenge the admissibility of key evidence in his case.Mr Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal murder charges, which carry the possibility of the death penalty.The pre-trial hearing could last several days, as defence attorneys are expected to call a host of witnesses, including from Pennsylvania, where he was arrested at a McDonald's.In September a judge threw out state terrorism-related murder charges against Mr Mangione, arguing prosecutors had failed to establish evidence to justify them.Mr Mangione's legal team is now hoping to convince a judge to exclude evidence including a gun and a notebook in which prosecutors say he set out a motive.The defendant was arrested days after he allegedly shot Mr Thompson, a father of two, as he was walking into an investors' conference on a busy Manhattan street on 4 December 2024.A date for either of his trials has not yet been set.Walking into court on Monday, Mr Mangione wore a grey suit and shirt, and court employees removed his hand restraints before he sat, as his lawyers requested.This week's hearing focuses on whether prosecutors illegally obtained evidence from Mr Mangione when they arrested him in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and whether it should be excluded as a result.Defence attorneys are seeking to suppress some of Mr Mangione's statements he made to police after being arrested - including allegedly giving them a false name.They argue he did so before police read him his rights, including the right to remain silent.His attorneys are also hoping to exclude from the trial a 9mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing, as well as writings found in Mr Mangione's backpack.Listen: The Mangione Trial podcastProsecutors have alleged that Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family who graduated from an Ivy League university - had written in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\".But defence lawyers are arguing his backpack was searched without a warrant, and the items found in it should be excluded for that reason.Eliminating those two critical pieces of evidence - that point to a murder weapon and motive - would be a big win for Mr Mangione's legal team.But the chances of that happening are \"virtually non existent\", said Dmitriy Shakhnevich, a criminal defence attorney in New York.He said that's because there are a number of exceptions to constitutional rules that law enforcement must obtain a warrant for personal searches, including some that may cover this case.\"In a case like this where there's a manhunt for a violent suspect who committed this alleged crime in plain view in New York City, nobody's getting a warrant,\" Mr Shakhnevich said. \"When they get him, they're going to search him.\"Prosecutors say they have other key evidence against the defendant, including DNA or fingerprints on items discarded near the crime scene.Mr Mangione's attorneys are probably aware of the long odds of getting evidence excluded, Mr Shakhnevich said.He added that the main reason why defence lawyers hold these type of proceedings is to preview trial testimony from law enforcement.So far, the court has heard from New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Sgt Chris McLaughlin, who was asked to review surveillance images from after the shooting.Prosecutors in court also played CCTV showing the killing. A worker who handled security cameras at the McDonald's in Altoona testified as well.Prosecutors played a 911 call for the court from a manager at the fast food restaurant who said customers had told her one patron looked like the suspect in Mr Thompson's killing. The manager said she had looked online for pictures of him but could only make out Mr Mangione's eyebrows as he ate in the restaurant, since he wore a hat and face mask. The court also heard from a correctional officer at the jail where Mr Mangione was being held who said he appeared \"unbothered and logical\" as the two discussed literature and health care, though Mr Mangione did not give his opinion on the latter topic. The officer said Mr Mangione was placed under a high level of security because they wanted to avoid an \"Epstein-style situation\", a reference to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while in a federal detention centre. Mr Shakhnevich said the legal team wants to have this type of information from witnesses so they can be aware of what people might say at trial, and to be on the lookout for any inconsistencies in their statements.\"The benefit of the hearing is that you get to have law enforcement officials testify, and you get to bind them to testimony for a trial later on,\" he said.Mr Mangione's legal team has also been pushing to bar the federal government from seeking the death penalty.They have said comments from high-ranking officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, accusing Mr Mangione of the murder have prejudiced his case, which they claim is motivated by politics.",

    "body": "13 hours agoFlora DruryandBBC IndonesianWatch: BBC reports from the site of deadly flooding in West SumatraThe death toll in the floods which struck Indonesia last week has now climbed to 631 on Tuesday, with rescue workers still battling to reach affected areas.The floods, which were caused by a rare cyclone that had formed over the Malacca Strait, have hit three provinces and impacted some 1.5 million people, according to the government's disaster agency.Nearly 500 people remain missing, while thousands more have been injured.Indonesia is just one part of Asia which has been hit with torrential rain and storms in recent days, with Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka all also reporting deaths.In Indonesia, the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have been hardest hit, with thousands still cut off and without critical supplies.About one million people have been evacuated, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said.Arini Amalia, a resident from Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, told the BBC the flood waters had been \"like a tsunami\".\"According to my grandmother, this is the worst, the worst in her life,\" Amalia said.Aid workers have been trying to reach people on foot and by motorcycle, as many roads are impassable to larger vehicles.Pictures from the region show bridges washed away, roads covered in mud and debris, and logs piled high.At West Sumatra's Twin Bridges landmark, where flood waters swept through and deposited enormous amounts of mud and debris, Mariana watched as excavators cleared the roads, hoping they would find her missing family members including her 15-year-old son.\"Watching the excavators, seeing how thick the mud is… I keep thinking, what condition will my child be in when they find him?\" she said. \"Will he still be intact? My mother, my brother-in-law… Looking at how it is here, maybe their faces won't even be recognisable any more.\"ReutersThe floods have impacted some 1.5 million people in IndonesiaMany are still waiting for food aid, with some saying they have not eaten for two to three days.Maysanti, who lives in Central Tapanuli which is one of the worst-hit areas in North Sumatra, told the BBC that aid workers were having trouble reaching her district.\"Everything is gone; our food supplies are running out. We can't eat,\" she said. \"Even instant noodles are being fought over now. Our food is gone; we need food and rice. Access to us is completely cut off.\"She said she has to walk kilometres away from her house to get an internet connection and basic necessities, like clean water.In Central Aceh where local authorities have provided Starlink devices, thousands were seen queuing outside the regency's office on Sunday night hoping to contact their loved ones or charge their mobile phones.\"It's been five days with no signal. We've been waiting since yesterday in case the network comes back. I'm planning to call my mother in Banda Aceh, but until now I still can't reach her,\" said one resident called Mar.As rescue efforts continue, anger has started to grow towards the government's disaster response.Critics say that authorities were ill-prepared for the floods. Some have blamed bureaucratic red tape for slowing down the distribution of food aid.Some activist groups have also claimed that environmental mismanagement, including the clearing of land for mining and agriculture, worsened the impact of the floods. On Monday, President Prabowo Subianto - who was visiting some of the flood affected areas in North Sumatra - acknowledged some roads were still cut off, but added \"we're doing everything we can to overcome difficulties\".\"We face this disaster with resilience and solidarity,\" he continued. \"Our nation is strong right now, able to overcome this.\"ReutersRescue workers and aid are still struggling to reach some areasAcross South and South East Asia, about 1,200 people have been killed in the last week in flooding and landslides. In Sri Lanka, at least 390 people died, while in Thailand the death toll has reached at least 176.However, there is no single weather event that has caused the floods. Instead, a combination of weather features have been to blame.According to BBC Weather, one element is the north-east monsoon, which affects East and South Asia from around November until March. As the name suggests, it brings north-easterly winds, which deliver a lot of rain to coastal areas exposed to this monsoon flow as moisture is picked up from the ocean and deposited over land.In Sri Lanka, the rainfall has been significantly enhanced by Cyclonic Storm Ditwah, which became very slow moving, delivering over half a metre of rain over a few days in some locations.That storm has now weakened and moved away northwards to bring rain in south-east India, with the forecast for Sri Lanka looking much drier over the coming days.In the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and southern Thailand, Cyclonic Storm Senyar had a similar effect, enhancing the monsoon and delivering more than a metre of rain in some places. This was a particularly rare storm, forming unusually close to the equator where cyclones do not normally develop.In Vietnam, the last few weeks have been exceptionally wet, with the monsoon rains having been enhanced by tropical cyclones. Now the remnants of ex-Typhoon Koto are drifting towards the Vietnamese coast, threatening more heavy downpours and further flooding.It is likely that climate change has also had a part to play. While global warming is not expected to lead to more tropical storms and cyclones, those that do occur have the potential to be more intense - with heavier rainfall leading to more flooding.",

Known as \"One Boss Lady\", she has become renowned for her rants about the president over the last two years.The 42-year-old was arrested at Zambia's main airport three months ago after arriving to attend her grandmother's funeral.She pleaded guilty in a magistrate's court in the capital, Lusaka, and apologised to the president for her comments.But Magistrate Webster Milumbe said the court had a duty to send a strong warning, noting that hate speech had become increasingly common.Edwards, who has been in police custody since her arrest, was convicted under the Cyber Security Act and the Cyber Crimes Act - new legislation that came into effect this year.She admitted to using a computer system to publish the offensive statements, acknowledged having no lawful excuse and conceded that her words were motivated by hatred.Her lawyer, Joseph Katati, described Edwards as a remorseful first offender with potential.He went on to detail how she was a breadwinner and philanthropist who sponsored a Zambian girls' football team that would suffer from her imprisonment.He also delivered a detailed public apology on her behalf.\"I want to unreservedly apologise to the president, Mr Hakainde Hichilema, his family, and the nation of Zambia for the words that I uttered against the president and for the negative effects that those words may have caused to the president, his family, and the nation at large,\" it said.Throughout her court appearances, Edwards appeared subdued - a stark contrast to her online persona.The magistrate acknowledged Mr Katati's plea for mitigation and said Edwards's sentence would be effective from the time of her arrest.Mr Katati said he had not yet received instructions from his client on whether to appeal against the sentence.The jailing of the influencer has divided opinion in Zambia, with some saying it was necessary while others arguing that it violates freedom of speech.Hichilema, who came to office in 2021, has abolished criminal defamation laws against the president, but Zambians still face prosecution under other laws.In September, two men were sentenced to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hichilema.",

    "body": "14 hours agoYvette TanVideo shows speed fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseHong Kong's leader John Lee has ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of a devastating fire that killed at least 151 people.Last Wednesday, seven of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex - which had been undergoing extensive renovations - went up in flames. Investigators have since found that a protective netting used around the buildings failed to meet flame retardant standards. At least 13 people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter, including the directors of a construction company. The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years and the death toll could rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.Chief Executive Lee said that the committee would be led by a judge and would conduct \"comprehensive reform\", adding that he would work to \"prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future\". Asked at a news conference why he should keep his job, Mr Lee acknowledged that reform was needed but failed to directly address the question. \"Yes, it is a tragedy, it is a big fire. Yes, we need reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plucked,\" he said. The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Getty ImagesThe fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 yearsSeparately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry into the fire. An online petition gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day before its contents were wiped.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police, according to local media reports.Asked about this on Tuesday, Lee did not address the question directly but said that \"criminals that commit offences must be taken to justice\". \"I emphasise I will not tolerate any crimes, particularly crimes that exploit the tragedy that we are facing now.\"Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticised the reported arrests.\"Now is the time for the Hong Kong authorities to transparently investigate the causes of the devastating fire...rather than silencing those who ask legitimate questions,\" Amnesty International said.Getty ImagesChief executive John Lee said that the committee would be led by a judgeWang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died.",

    "body": "8 hours agoIan AikmanAFP via Getty ImagesProtests took place in cities across Bulgaria - the biggest for decadesBulgaria's government has said it will withdraw its controversial 2026 budget plan after massive rallies were held against it on Monday night in the capital, Sofia, and in cities across the country.Tens of thousands of people joined protests to oppose the draft budget, which they said attempted to hide widespread government corruption. Clashes with the police broke out when some masked protesters attacked the offices of the ruling conservative Gerb party and also of the DPS party in Sofia.The government said on Tuesday it would abandon the plan, which also would have raised taxes. It comes after similar protests broke out last week, when the initial plan was submitted to parliament.Next year's budget will be Bulgaria's first delivered in euros, as it joins the eurozone on 1 January.Public opinion over adopting the euro is divided, with some fearing it could lead to sharp inflation in what is one of the EU's poorest countries.Protests against government corruption have been frequent in Bulgaria, which has been run by short-lived governments since 2020, after protests sparked the end of another Gerb-led coalition.ReutersA drone view shows protesters gathered outside the parliament in SofiaMonday's rally is thought to have been the largest in the capital for years, with protesters filling a huge square in front of parliament carrying signs urging a change in leadership.Significant protests also took place in Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas, Blagoevgrad and other cities.Critics of the abandoned budget plan said they were protesting against increases to social security contributions and taxes on dividends to finance higher spending, as well as state corruption.\"We are here to protest for our future. We want to be a European country, not one ruled by corruption and the mafia,\" Ventsislava Vasileva, a 21-year-old student, told the AFP news agency.More than 70 people were arrested after masked protesters attacked the offices of political parties, according to Sofia's interior affairs chief Lyubomir Nikolov.ReutersProtesters in Sofia were seen setting bins on fire, breaking windows, and clashing with police in riot gearBulgarian President Rumen Radev called for an end to the violence, which he dismissed as a \"provocation by the mafia\", and urged everyone to obey the law. \"Provocations do not change the fact: Bulgarians said NO to this government,\" he said in a post on Facebook before the budget was abandoned. \"There is only one way out: resignation and early elections.\"As head of state, Radev holds a largely ceremonial role.The government is currently led by Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov, who formed a minority coalition in January 2025 after the centre-right Gerb party won October 2024's elections without a clear majority.A parliamentary committee had adopted the budget plan on 18 November, but Zhelyazkov later said he would delay it to allow for more time to consult opposition parties, trade unions and employers.After Monday's protests, Zhelyazkov's government issued a short statement saying it would withdraw its draft proposals and start a new budget procedure. Bulgaria's opposition party has called for the government to resign, saying abandoning the draft budget is not enough, according to local media.",

    "body": "3 hours agoChris EwokorBBC Africa's West Africa correspondentNigeria has granted asylum to Guinea-Bissau presidential candidate Fernando Dias da Costa just days after a coup prevented the results of the recent election being announced.The 47-year-old, who ran as a candidate for the Party for Social Renewal, was under special protection at the Nigerian embassy, following \"threats made against\" him, Nigeria's foreign minister said.Dias was the main challenger to Umaro Sissoco Embaló, who was seeking a second term as president and has left the country following the military takeover.A delegation from the West African bloc Ecowas has been in the country, urging the military to step aside and release the results of the vote.But the electoral commission has now said it will not be able to publish the results as armed men wearing balaclavas had destroyed paperwork and the main computer server that was storing the results from different regions.Both Embaló and Dias had claimed victory in presidential poll held on 23 November.The PAIGC party, the liberation movement that ended Portuguese colonial rule, had been barred from fielding a candidate.The coup took place three days after the vote. The military suspended the electoral process, blocked the release of the results and insisted it was acting to thwart a plot to destabilise the politically unstable country.The junta has also tightened restrictions in the country, banning all demonstrations and \"all disturbing actions of peace and stability in the country\". Tensions remain high in the capital, Bissau. PAIGC said its headquarters had been \"illegally invaded by heavily armed militia groups\" following the coup.Its leader, Domingos Pereira, was arrested on the day of the coup, according to family and party members. Dias said he escaped from his campaign headquarters on the day of the coup as armed men came to arrest him.Nigeria's Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar said President Bola Tinubu had agreed to give Dias protection inside the Nigerian embassy in Bissau.\"The decision to accommodate Mr [Fernando Dias] da Costa in the Nigerian premises underscores our firm commitment to safeguarding the democratic aspirations and the sovereign will of the good people of Guinea-Bissau,\" Tuggar said in a letter to Ecowas Commission president Alieu Omar Touray.The letter also asked that soldiers from an Ecowas unit in the country be deployed to the Nigerian embassy to keep Dias safe.Meditation talks on Monday between the Ecowas delegation, led by Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Alhaji Musa Timothy Kabba, and the junta were heated.Afterwards, Kabba told journalists that the discussions were \"productive,\" but noted that \"both parties expressed their concerns\". The junta has already sworn in a new transitional leader, Gen Horta N'Tam, who will rule the country for a year.Ecowas leaders have suspended Guinea-Bissau from all decision-making bodies until constitutional order is restored.On Tuesday, Idrissa Djalo, a senior official of the electoral commission, explained how its offices had come under attack on the day of the coup.\"They confiscated the computers of all 45 staff members who were at the commission that day,\" he said in a statement.Not only had the results held there been destroyed but also election tally sheets from the two key regions that were being transferred to the capital were intercepted and confiscated by armed men, he added.The true motives behind the coup in Guinea-Bissau remain unclear amid speculation that it may have been staged.Senegal's Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and Nigeria's ex-leader Goodluck Jonathan have both said the coup was fabricated without providing evidence. Some local civil society groups have also accused Embaló of masterminding a \"simulated coup\" against himself with the help of the military, saying it was a ruse to block election results from coming out in case he lost.Embaló, who has previously faced accusations of using crises to quash dissent, has not responded to the coup allegations.The 53-year-old was allowed to leave for neighbouring Senegal on Thursday, from where he reportedly moved on to Congo-Brazzaville at the weekend.Guinea-Bissau has witnessed at least nine coups or attempted coups over the last five decades.Sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, it is known as a drug-trafficking hub where the military has been influential since it gained independence from Portugal in 1974.",

    "body": "1 day agoPaul NjieBBC Africa, YaoundéAFP via Getty ImagesAnicet Ekane's  family was given little explanation - \"his wife was just presented the corpse\", his lawyer told the BBCLeft-wing Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane has died in detention, five weeks after he was arrested, his lawyers and party have announced.Ekane, 74, was among the leaders of an opposition coalition who endorsed Issa Tchiroma Bakary in October's presidential election.Tchiroma Bakary says he was the rightful winner of the poll, officially won by 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya. Tchiroma Bakary has since fled to The Gambia.No official cause of Ekane's death has been announced. His party has accused the authorities of denying him access to his medication - a charge the government has denied.According to a spokesman for Ekane's African Movement for New Independence and Democracy (Manidem) party, Ekane died on Monday morning at a military medical facility, after his health worsened over the weekend.\"We have no clarification... His wife had been called to come and when she found herself there, she was just presented the corpse of her husband,\" he said.He added that the family later took the corpse to the mortuary.Defence ministry spokesman Capt Cyrille Serge Atonfack said the Manidem leader had died from illness, but did not give any further details.\"The deceased, who suffered from various chronic pathologies, had been interned at the Military Medical Centre of the National Gendarmerie,\" he said, adding that the politician had been well taken care of by doctors since his arrest on 24 October.Minister of Communication and government spokesperson René Emmanuel Sadi later expressed the government's condolences to Ekane's family, as well as the Manidem party.He also said that Ekane had received proper medical attention from both his personal doctors and those at the military hospital where he was admitted, adding that an investigation had been launched to determine the exact circumstances of Ekane's death.Renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna described Ekane's death as \"the extinguishing of a fierce and passionate flame\" that burned for democratic emancipation.Muna said in a statement that Ekane had informed him of his ill-health during their last conversation.\"One would have thought that basic humanity, the fundamental presumption of innocence, and the undeniable evidence of his failing health would have compelled his release to his family and the care of the medical experts who knew his condition,\" Muna said.According to Ekane's lawyers, he was accused of hostility against the state, incitement to revolt, and calls for insurrection.\"He was never presented before a judge or charged with any misdemeanour,\" said one of his lawyers, Hippolyte Meli, in a statement on social media, describing the detention of the Manidem party leader as \"illegal\".In recent weeks, rumours had circulated that the opposition figure had died, and Ekane's party members had demanded to see him \"dead or alive\".His death has sent shockwaves across the nation, with supporters gathering at the party headquarters in Douala to grieve. Others have taken to venting their anger online.Manidem says its premises have been surrounded by security forces.AFP via Getty ImagesOpposition protesters accused the ruling party of rigging the elections to ensure Paul Biya stayed in powerEkane initially endorsed another vibrant opposition figure, Maurice Kamto, for the presidential election. But Kamto, who endured a long detention after disputing the previous election in 2018, had his candidacy rejected upfront this time by both the electoral body, Elecam, and the Constitutional Council, on the grounds that the party had endorsed more than one candidate.Ekane and other politicians went on to create the Union for Change Coalition, which named former government spokesman Tchiroma Bakary as its candidate.At least 48 people were killed by Cameroon's security forces during protests against the re-election of President Biya, according to the UN.This included a number of people shot dead near Tchiroma Bakary's residence in the city of Garoua. He later claimed that snipers had been stationed at the house across from his, and were \"firing at point-blank range at the people\".The Cameroonian government has denied any wrongdoing.

    "body": "'Hung by my wrists and beaten': Israeli-Russian woman says Iraqi militants tortured her in captivity10 hours agoTim FranksBBC NewshourBBCElizabeth Tsurkov spoke to the BBC from Israel, where she is recovering from her ordealAn Israeli-Russian woman held captive for two and a half years by militants in Iraq has told the BBC how she invented \"confessions\" to try to get her captors to stop torturing her. Elizabeth Tsurkov, who was freed in September, says she suffered extreme abuse for 100 days, leaving her physically and mentally scarred.Warning: This article contains distressing content including descriptions of torture\"My health is not great,\" Ms Tsurkov says. The interview she gave to BBC Newshour was conducted in central Israel, propped  up on a bed. It is now almost three months after her release from captivity in Iraq, where she was held for 903 days. The first four and a half months had been particularly brutal: she was, she says, trussed and hung from the ceiling, whipped, sexually abused, electrocuted.In March 2023, Ms Tsurkov, a 39-year-old doctoral student at Princeton University in the US, was living in Baghdad, conducting fieldwork for her PhD in comparative politics. She agreed to meet a woman who described herself as a friend of a friend. The woman never showed up. Ms Tsurkov started walking home. She says that a car pulled up behind her and two men dragged her in, beating and sexually assaulting her. She was driven to the outskirts of the capital.\"During the first month, they starved me and interrogated me, but at the time they didn't know about my Israeli citizenship. They're simply convinced that all foreigners are spies.\" Ms Tsurkov had insisted that she was a Russian citizen. But then the kidnappers accessed her phone, and \"because I'm not a spy and don't have multiple encrypted devices, everything showed that I'm Israeli\".She says that was when the torture started: electrocutions, beatings, whippings, sexual abuse and what she calls Middle Eastern \"specialities\". \"Being hung from the ceiling with hands cuffed behind my back. Being hung with the hands above my head.\" And \"a particular method that is used in Iraq. It's called 'the scorpion'. You get handcuffed with [your] shoulders crossed behind the back. It often leads to dislocation of shoulders.\"Elizabeth TsurkovMs Tsurkov was carrying out fieldwork for her PhD in Baghdad when she was kidnappedMs Tsurkov believes she was held by members of Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iran-backed militias in Iraq, designated a terrorist organisation by the US and others. These militias are part of the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces and are widely seen in the country as wielding considerable behind-the-scenes power in government and in commerce.In the brief periods between torture, she tried to strategise. \"I had to learn all sorts of weird conspiracy theories. They live in an alternative reality in which Israel and the United States and Saudi Arabia together created ISIS [the Islamic State group], and the US spreads homosexuality through single sex cafes.\"She created confessions about herself to try to avoid torture, based on spy plots and her captors' \"quite insane worldview\", while not implicating any Iraqis. Many of her friends, she says, were activists whom the militants also wanted to kidnap and torture.But her strategy had one major downside. \"They would torture me so I would give them these confessions that I would invent, and then they simply got greedy. So, they would return, hang me by my wrists and start beating me with a stick and using even harsher methods of torture and saying, 'I want something new.'\"Ms Tsurkov says she does not understand why, after 100 days of abuse, she was moved to another location. She was still in solitary confinement with no outside light, but the torture stopped.What she is certain about is how she came to be released. The US businessman Mark Savaya, who campaigned for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, was appointed US special envoy to Iraq this October.According to Ms Tsurkov, one month before, he had travelled to Baghdad to speak to Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Among the messages he conveyed, she says, was that President Trump was extremely annoyed about her captivity, and that if she were not freed within a week, the leadership of Kataib Hezbollah would be killed. Within days, she was released.When he announced Ms Tsurkov's freedom from captivity on 9 September, Iraq's prime minister described it as \"a culmination of extensive efforts exerted by our security services over the course of many months\". He also stressed Iraq's commitment to law enforcement and state authority.He made no mention of Kataib Hezbollah or any US threat. But two weeks later, a senior official in Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Ali al-Askari, put out a statement saying that Sudani's government had sought Ms Tsurkov's release in order to prevent a US strike on Iraq and to oblige the US to comply with its agreement to withdraw its forces from the country. He also claimed that Ms Tsurkov had been released after \"giving out all the information she had\" under interrogation by the \"entity\" holding her.The US State Department did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.ReutersPresident Trump said Ms Tsurkov was held by Iraqi militia Kataib HezbollahMs Tsurkov's long road to rehabilitation - mental and physical - is beginning in Israel. But she is determined to complete her PhD at Princeton. Since her release, she has watched the parties associated with the Iran-backed militias grow in strength in recent parliamentary elections in Iraq.  More broadly, she says, it is ordinary Iraqis who lose out from a \"horribly corrupt system in an incredibly rich country\", where the commanders of the militias \"continue to operate above the law\".Ms Tsurkov, who has lived in Israel since her release, says she sees a country transformed in the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 and Israel's protracted war in Gaza. \"I'm undergoing therapy, and many of the kind of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are collectively experienced by Israelis since October 7th. There's a great sense of insecurity and desire to unleash the anger that exists within people.\" Ms Tsurkov has been a long-standing critic of Israeli government policy towards Palestinians and within the region. She has a wide circle of Palestinian, Lebanese and Iraqi friends. She's worked for the Israel NGO Gisha, which campaigns to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians.The events of the last two years have, she says, left her much more pessimistic about the possibility of peace. \"October 7th was a literal massacre of the left, because many of the people who live in the kibbutzim, the communities along the Gaza border, were peace activists. And it's a massacre of the left in the sense that the voices who support peace have gotten much weaker and more demonised.\"More immediately, she has her own recovery to concentrate on. She had, she says, previously worked with victims of torture. \"But nothing prepares you for the horror of undergoing it.\" She also reveals the toll of the false confessions. \"It kind of seeps through in some way; maybe like the situation of a battered wife who internalises to some extent the view of the abuser of herself.\"There is one key fact to cling to: that she got out. \"For sure, I have more recovery ahead of me. But I think I was lucky, in a very unlucky situation.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondent, KyivWatch: Escaping Ukraine's war-ravaged Donbas region.Trains no longer run to Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region - part of the Donbas claimed in its entirety by Russia's President Vladimir Putin. It's another sign of the steady Russian advance.Instead, the last station is now on the western side of the Donetsk border. This is where civilians and soldiers wait for a ride towards relative safety - their train to get out of Dodge.Putin has been sounding more bullish since the leak of US proposals to end the war, widely seen as being in tune with his maximalist demands. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says territory remains the most difficult issue facing US-led peace talks.At the last station on the line, soldier Andrii and his girlfriend Polina are parting after an all-too-brief time together. Andrii has to return to the front and they don't know when they'll see each other again.He laughs when I mention peace talks, which have seen Donald Trump's envoys speak to Ukrainian negotiators before heading to Moscow, and dismisses them as \"chatter, just chatter\". He doesn't think the war will be over soon.BBC/Matthew GoddardSoldier Denys is adamant that the Donbas should not be given to Russia in a peace deal There is scepticism, too, among other soldiers who board the train west for a brief respite from the fighting. They are taking some of their 20 days of leave. Most look exhausted.Russian forces now control some 85% of the Donbas, made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. On Tuesday they claimed to have captured the key strategic town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk. Ukraine said fighting was continuing in the city.Denys, who has been serving in the Ukrainian army for the past two years, tells me \"everyone's drained, everyone's tired mentally and physically\". Some of his comrades have already fallen asleep. His unit has been fighting in the besieged city of Kostyantynivka.\"It's scary, really scary,\" he says, describing drones flying around \"like flies\". But he makes it clear they are not ready to give up after sacrificing so much.\"Nobody will give Putin the Donbas. No way, it's our land,\" he says.Ceding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk \"fortress belt\" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians.Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture Pokrovsk and Ukraine is reluctant to hand over such important strategic hubs.But US officials believe Ukraine is both outnumbered and outgunned.There's already been an exodus of civilians from the Donbas. It's continuing as  peace talks take place. We witness dozens, old and young, arriving at a reception centre just over the border in Lozova.They had taken advantage of heavy fog to make their escape. Less chance of being targeted by drones. Around 200 people arrive at this one reception centre every single day. They're given basic supplies and some money.BBC/Matthew GoddardRefugees fleeing the Donbas take advantage of foggy conditions as visibility is reduced for enemy drones Yevheniy and his wife Maryna have just arrived from Kramatorsk, along with their two children. She tells me there are \"more drones now\". \"It's getting harder and harder to even go outside. Everything is dangerous,\" she says. \"Even going to the shop, you might not come back.\"The family are planning to move to the capital, Kyiv. Yevheniy has little faith in the peace talks. He says \"that side [Russia] won't agree to our terms. We understand nothing good will come of it\".But others appear more willing to contemplate giving up their home for good in return for peace.Oleksandr says it is too dangerous to stay. His children have already gone to Germany. While he describes Russia's maximalist demands as \"probably unacceptable\", he appears willing to contemplate some of what was in the leaked peace plan - trading territory for peace. The original version of the US draft envisaged that areas of Donbas still under Ukrainian control be handed over to Russia de facto.\"Personally I would agree to those terms,\" he says.BBC/Matthew Goddard\"Serhii\" has been in hiding since he deserted his unit in MayInna, escaping with her five children, also believes it's time to make a deal. She could no longer hide her kids, aged between nine months and 12 years, from the dangers of living in Kramatorsk. She had tried telling them the explosions they heard while seeking shelter in their cellar were just fireworks.\"The main thing is that there will be peace,\" Inna says. When I ask whether that means giving up her home for good, she replies, \"in this situation, yes\". They're already making plans to rebuild their lives elsewhere.Some soldiers sent to the Donbas are also voting with their feet. There have been nearly 300,000 cases of desertion, or soldiers going  absent without official leave, since the start of Russia's full scale invasion - and numbers have risen dramatically over the past year.One of them is Serhii - not his real name. We met him in hiding. His home has become his prison as he tries to evade arrest. Serhii volunteered to fight at the start of the year, whereas most of the men in his unit were forcibly mobilised - \"taken off the street\".He says his unit was already below strength when it was sent to the front, near Pokrovsk, and they weren't properly trained or equipped. \"I ended up in a battalion where everything was a mess,\" he says, although he still believes this was the exception, not the norm.Serhii deserted in May after two of his friends went awol.\"I wouldn't have gone if we had proper leadership and someone experienced in charge,\" he says. \"I came to serve, not to run\".Serhii is still thinking about his next move, and the possibility of returning to the army. But he echoes recent US warnings that the odds in this war are stacked against Ukraine.Asked whether he believes Ukraine can win, he is doubtful. \"If you think logically, no. A country of 140 million against us with 32 million - logically it doesn't add up.\"Additional reporting by Mariana Matveichuk",

    "body": "US Navy admiral ordered second  deadly Venezuela boat strike, White House says5 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: White House defends Venezuela boat strikes, says Admiral Bradley acted legallyA top US Navy admiral ordered a second round of strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat, the White House has confirmed.The \"double tap\" strike on 2 September has drawn bipartisan scrutiny among US lawmakers. The Washington Post recently reported that two people survived the first blast and were still clinging to the burning vessel when they were killed, raising fresh legality questions.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth authorised the strikes but did not give an order to \"kill everybody\", as the report said.\"Admiral (Frank) Bradley worked well within his authority and the law\" in ordering the additional strike, Leavitt said.Hegseth: \"We've only just begun striking narco-boats\"More than 80 people have been killed in a number of similar strikes in the Caribbean Sea since early September. Each announcement from US officials is usually accompanied by  grainy video, but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking, and few details on who or what was on board each vessel.The Trump administration says it is acting in self-defence by destroying boats carrying illicit drugs to the US.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern over the report of the 2 September incident and have vowed congressional reviews of the strikes.Democrats, including Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada, have also said that Hegseth should resign if he ordered a strike against the two people.\"If the reports are true, Pete Hegseth likely committed a war crime when he gave an illegal order that led to the killing of incapacitated survivors of the U.S. strike in the Caribbean,\" said Rosen, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, in a statement where she also called for a thorough investigation.Democrats on the committee, many of whom served in the military, had already requested that Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi publicly release the Office of Legal Counsel's written opinion that laid out the legal basis for the strikes, as some experts raised concerns that they could be unlawfulDuring the Monday press briefing, Leavitt said that President Donald Trump and  Hegseth \"have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war\".The press secretary neither confirmed whether the first strike left two survivors, nor that the second attack was intended to kill them.Media reports that Hegseth had given the directive to kill all those on board the vessel during the 2 September strike have renewed concerns about the legality of US military strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.Hegseth has pushed back against accusations in the report, calling them \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory\". On Monday, he tweeted that Admiral Bradley \"is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. \"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"Trump: Hegseth said he 'did not order the death of those two men'In recent weeks the US has expanded its military presence in the Caribbean, as part of what it calls an anti-narcotics operation.Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\".Over the weekend, the Senate Armed Services Committee said it would be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts\" related to the 2 September strikes. The Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Roger Wicker, said on Monday that the lawmakers are planning to interview the \"admiral that was in charge of the operation\". He added that it was also seeking audio and video to \"see what the orders were\".The Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives also said it would lead a \"bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question\".The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a body of the highest-ranking US military officers, met both the House and Senate's armed services committees over the weekend. Discussions centred around the operations in the region and \"the intent and legality of missions to disrupt illicit trafficking networks\", the group said. Multiple experts who spoke to the BBC have raised serious doubts that the second strike on alleged survivors could be considered legal under international law. The survivors may have been subject to protections provided to shipwrecked sailors, or to those given to troops who have been rendered unable to continue fighting.The Trump administration has said its operations in the Caribbean is a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers.The rules of engagement in such armed conflicts - as set out in the Geneva Conventions - forbid the targeting of wounded participants, saying that those participants should instead be apprehended and cared for.Under former-President Barack Obama, the US military came under scrutiny for firing multiple rounds from drones, in a practice known as the \"double tap\", that sometimes resulted in civilian casualties. On Sunday, Venezuela's National Assembly condemned the boat strikes and vowed to carry out a \"rigorous and thorough investigation\" into the 2 September strikes.The Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government. In an interview with BBC Newsnight on Monday, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said Trump's allegations stem from \"great envy\" for the country's natural resources.He also called for a direct dialogue between the US and Venezuelan governments, \"to clear the toxic atmosphere we have witnessed since July of last year\".On Sunday, Trump confirmed that he had held a brief phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in which he pressured him to resign and leave Venezuela with his family. According to reports, during the call last month, Trump told Maduro that he could go to a destination of his choosing, but only if he agreed to depart immediately. After he refused, Trump posted on social media that the airspace over Venezuela should be considered \"closed in its entirety\".Maduro requested amnesty for his top aides, and that he be allowed to continue control of the military after giving up the government. Trump refused both demands,  according to The Miami Post and Reuters, reporting the BBC has not confirmed. US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of a \"terrorist\" organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking. Maduro has denied the claims.With additional reporting by Lucy Gilder and Thomas Copeland",

    "body": "3 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlineReutersUS President Donald Trump has been ramping up pressure on Venezuela's leader,  President Nicolás Maduro.The Trump administration has doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture, and its warships are within striking distance of Venezuela. Dozens of people have been killed in attacks on boats alleged to have been transporting drugs from the South American country.Trump reportedly also gave Maduro an ultimatum to leave Venezuela, in a phone call the two men had on 21 November.Who is Nicolás Maduro?REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez ViloriaNicolás Maduro rose to prominence under the leadership of left-wing President Hugo Chávez and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV).Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader, succeeded Chávez and has been president since 2013.During the 26 years that Chávez and Maduro have been in power, their party has gained control of key institutions, including the National Assembly, much of the judiciary, and the electoral council. In 2024, the electoral council declared Maduro the winner of the presidential election, even though voting tallies collected by the opposition suggested that their candidate, Edmundo González, had won by a landslide.The US is one of many countries which declared the election illegitimate and recognised González as \"president-elect\".But with Maduro firmly in control of the military, the police and the legislature, he has remained in power and González has fled into exile for fear of arrest.Why is Trump focusing on Venezuela?Trump has made stopping immigration a priority during his second term in office and he blames Maduro for the arrival of a large number of Venezuelan migrants in the US.Since 2013, close to eight million Venezuelans are estimated to have fled the economic crisis and political repression in Venezuela, which have both worsened under Maduro.Most have fled to Latin American countries, but hundreds of thousands have gone to the US.Without providing evidence, Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US.Trump has also focused on fighting the influx of drugs - especially fentanyl and cocaine - into the US.As part of his war on drugs, he has designated two Venezuelan criminal groups - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as Foreign Terrorist Organisations and has alleged that the latter is led by Maduro himself.Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try and depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast reserves of oil.Analysts have pointed out that the Cartel de los Soles is not a hierarchical group but an umbrella term. They say it is used to describe corrupt Venezuelan officials who have allowed cocaine to transit through the country.Why has the US sent warships to the Caribbean?US Navy via REUTERSThe USS Gerald Ford is among the ships deployed to the Caribbean The US has deployed 15,000 troops and a range of aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers, and amphibious assault ships to the Caribbean.The stated aim of the deployment - the largest in the region since the US invaded Panama in 1989 - is to stop the flow of fentanyl and cocaine to the US.Since early September, US forces have carried out more than 20 strikes in international waters on boats alleged to have been carrying drugs. More than 80 people have been killed in the strikes.The Trump administration argues that it is involved in a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers, whom it accuses of conducting irregular warfare against the US.The US has also described those on board as \"narco terrorists\" but legal experts say the strikes are unlawful as that designation \"did not transform them into lawful military targets\". A former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court told the BBC that the US military campaign fell into the category of a planned, systematic attack against civilians during peacetime.In response, the White House said that President Donald Trump acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect the US from cartels \"trying to bring poison to our shores... destroying American lives\".Is Venezuela flooding the US with drugs?Counternarcotic experts have pointed out that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, and that it acts as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled on their way to their final destination.   Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is smuggled to the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.According to a US Drug Enforcement report from 2020, almost three quarters of the cocaine reaching the US is estimated to be trafficked via the Pacific with just a small percentage coming via fast boats in the Caribbean.Nevertheless, most of the strikes the US has carried out have been in the Caribbean, with just a few in the Pacific.In September, Trump told US military leaders that the boats targeted \"are stacked up with bags of white powder that's mostly fentanyl and other drugs, too\".However, fentanyl is produced mainly in Mexico and reaches the US almost exclusively via land through its southern border.Could the US carry out strikes on Venezuela?Trump has confirmed that he spoke to Maduro on the phone on 21 November. While he did not reveal what was said in the call, Reuters news agency reported that Trump gave Maduro a one-week ultimatum to leave Venezuela along with his close family. It said that Maduro did not take him up on the offer of safe passage.One day after the deadline expired, Trump declared the airspace around Venezuela closed.Trump has already threatened to take action against Venezuelan drug traffickers \"by land\", but has not specified how such an operation would unfold.Trump's press secretary has also not ruled out the possibility of US troops being deployed on the ground in Venezuela, telling reporters that \"there's options at the president's disposal that are on the table\".She did not elaborate further on the options but military analysts have for weeks pointed out that the US deployment in the Caribbean is much larger than needed for a counternarcotics operation.",

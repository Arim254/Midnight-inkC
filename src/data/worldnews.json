    "body": "48 minutes agoLaura Bicker,China correspondent, BeijingandKelly NgA huge explosion at a factory in northern China has killed four people and injured 84 others, with six people still missing, state media reported. The blast happened at around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) Sunday at Baogang United Steel plant in Inner Mongolia, causing noticeable tremors in the area.Footage online showed the explosion sending large plumes of smoke into the sky, while the ground was littered with debris, including collapsed ceilings and pipes. Five among the dozens hospitalised suffered serious injuries, state media reported. Authorities are investigating the cause of the blast.Baogang United Steel is a major state-owned iron and steel enterprise.China has a long history of industrial accidents, from factory explosions and mine collapses to mudslides.In 2015, two massive explosions in the port of Tianjin killed 173 people, leaving hundreds more injured and devastating large areas of the city.In May last year, an explosion in a chemical plant in the eastern province of Shandong killed five people and injured at least 19.  The blast ripped the windows of building nearby from their hinges.",

    "body": "59 minutes agoSofia Ferreira SantosandAlicia CurryGUARDIA CIVIL HANDOUT/EPAAt least 39 people have died and dozens more have been injured after two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, the country's Civil Guard has said.The incident near the city of Córdoba has been described by local officials as Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is expected to visit the scene later on Monday, where rescue efforts are ongoing.Here's what we know about the incident so far.Follow live updatesWhere did the crash happen?The crash occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid.The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said.It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added.What caused the crash?What caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.Puente has described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error.Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it.He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. He suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause.Are people still trapped in the trains?There were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Alvia, according to a statement from Renfe.It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. \"The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,\" Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.\"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,\" he added.Who are the victims?The 39 victims of the crash have not yet been identified, with Puente saying the death toll \"is not yet final\" as investigations into the crash commence.As of midday on Monday, 112 people had received medical assistance, 43 of whom remained hospitalised, local emergency services said.Among the 43 victims still in hospital:Four are underage, including one who is in intensive careTwelve adults are also in intensive careWhat have the survivors said?Passengers on board the Madrid-bound train described the moment of impact feeling like an \"earthquake\" and said it shattered the train's windows, displaced luggage and threw people to the floor. \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" journalist Salvador Jimenez told public broadcaster Canal Sur.\"There were people screaming, calling for doctors,\" he added.Another passenger, Lucas Meriako, told Spanish broadcaster La Sexta Noticias he was in the fifth carriage of the same train when he started to \"feel some banging\" that got louder and louder.\"Another train passed us and everything started vibrating. There was a jolt behind us and the feeling that the whole train was going to fall apart,\" he described.",

Boric said the death toll was expected to increase.The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.Local media have shown pictures of charred cars in the streets.Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling 24 fires across the country on Sunday.

Emergency services treated 122 people, with 43, including four children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 adults and one child are in intensive care.Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\", as officials launched an investigation.Puente described the incident as \"extremely strange\". All the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\", he told reporters in Madrid.Follow live updatesRail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the train left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, Puente said. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters news agency.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Córdoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.\"Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\". \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"ReutersPassengers were taken to hospital and advanced medical posts near the site of the crashAll rail services between Madrid and Andalusia were suspended following the accident and are expected to remain closed all day on Monday.Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Málaga, said around 300 passengers were on board the train that first derailed, while the other train – operated by the state-funded firm Renfe – had around 100 passengers.The official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month, according to the transport minister. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a \"night of deep pain\". The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident, describing it as \"a nightmare\".King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\".\"We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,\" the royal palace said on X.The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.EPAFriends and relatives have been seeking information about their loved ones on board either train.Advanced medical posts were set up for impacted passengers to be treated for injuries and transferred to hospital. Adif said it set up spaces for relatives of the victims at Atocha, Seville, Córdoba, Málaga and Huelva stations. The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"ReutersThe foyer of the hospital close to the crash site, Caseta Municipal in Adamuz, filled with affected passengers.French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen have published statements offering condolences. \"My thoughts are with the victims, their families and the entire Spanish people. France stands by your side,\" Macron wrote on social media.In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured. Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country.

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US President Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.In a Sunday interview on CBS Face the Nation, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned Trump's threat to send more troops into the city, saying the existing presence of federal ICE agents is already an \"occupying force that has quite literally invaded our city\".\"You can go through whatever rhetorical flourish you want, but when you have 3,000 ICE agents and border control come to the city, when you've got this supposed threat of 1,500 military coming to the city, yeah, that's very much what it feels like,\" Frey said.Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.On Friday, Judge Katherine Menendez ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Sunday interview on CBS's Face the Nation that the judge's ruling is \"a little ridiculous\" because it \"didn't change anything\". \"We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,\" Noem said. \"So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.\"The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

    "body": "The Syrian government has announced an immediate nationwide ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), taking almost full control of the country, Syrian state media says.The ceasefire ends nearly two weeks of fighting and forms part of a broader 14-point agreement that will see the SDF integrated into Syria's military and state institutions.Speaking in Damascus, President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to reassert control over three eastern and northern governorates - al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa. It follows a meeting between al-Sharaa and the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Damascus. Barrack praised the agreement as a step toward a \"unified Syria.\"SDF commander Mazloum Abdi was expected to attend the meeting but was unable to travel due to weather conditions, with his visit postponed until Monday, al-Sharaa said.In a televised address, Abdi confirmed the meeting and said he would share more details about the agreement with Syria's Kurds after returning from the capital. Speaking on Kurdish television channel Ronahi, he said the deal he had agreed to with Damascus included a ceasefire to avoid a broader war, stressing that the fighting had been \"imposed\" on the SDF.Kurdish-led forces established their autonomous administration during Syria's civil war, almost a decade ago, with strong backing from the United States, which armed and trained the SDF as its main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group (Isis). With US military support, the SDF drove Isis from much of northeastern Syria and went on to govern both Kurdish and Arab-majority areas.Under the agreement, signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi, Syrian authorities will take over civilian institutions, border crossings and oil and gas fields that have underpinned Kurdish self-rule. SDF military and security personnel will be integrated into Syria's defence and interior ministries following vetting, while Damascus will assume responsibility for prisons and detention camps holding tens of thousands of foreign Isis fighters and their families.Damascus also reiterated pledges to recognise Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, including giving Kurdish official language status and marking the Kurdish new year as a national holiday - the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence from France in 1946.Kuridsh media reported that Abdi said the SDF remained committed to protecting what he described as the \"achievements\" and \"specific characteristics\" of the Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria.The agreement also reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State.The deal follows months of stalled negotiations after a previous integration effort failed and comes after Syrian government forces moved into Raqqa and nearby oil facilities following an SDF withdrawal earlier on Sunday.Al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.",

    "body": "15 hours agoNick BeakeEurope correspondent, in BrusselsIt's not yet a full year since European leaders buckled up for President Trump's second term, and now this rollercoaster ride feels it has reached its most dangerous turn yet.The occupant on the White House is dangling the threat of economic punishment over the heads of countries that are supporting the territorial integrity of an EU member, Denmark. Leaders will hold an emergency EU summit about this in the coming days. If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US.If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force?French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's \"trade bazooka\" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts.There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power.They were thinking of China, not the US.In the here and now, some EU leaders are wary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump.She has spoken of a \"problem of understanding and communication\" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood.If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat.Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis.Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts.It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it.EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous.Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic.But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.",

    "body": "Three shark attacks have been reported in Sydney in a little over 24 hours, leaving at least two seriously injured, according to local authorities.A man was taken to hospital in critical condition after being injured at Manly beach on Monday evening, New South Wales Police said in a statement. Hours earlier, an 11-year-old surfer had to be assisted off Sydney's Dee Why Beach after a suspected shark bit his surfboard, with the local council urging swimmers and surfers to be cautious.The first incident saw a 12-year-old boy taken to hospital with critical injuries after he was attacked by a large shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon, police said.The boy and his group of friends were jumping off a six-metre rock ledge at Shark Beach, in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse, when the attack happened on Sunday.Despite its name, shark attacks are rare at Shark Beach, a popular swimming spot.The boy was pulled out of the water by his friends before rescuers arrived. Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,\" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.\"Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.\"Marine police arrived to a \"horrendous scene\", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least five fatal shark attacks in the country last year.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJemma CrewandNick Edser,Business reportersGetty ImagesTrade tensions and a reversal in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom are among the main risks to global economic growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned.Its comments came in its latest world economic outlook, where it described the global economy as \"steady\", with growth expected to remain \"resilient\" this year.The IMF's forecast was produced ahead of Donald Trump's threat at the weekend to impose tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland.The fund also said the independence of central banks was \"paramount\" for global economic stability and growth.The economic watchdog said global growth was projected to reach 3.3% this year - an increase from its previous forecast of 3.1% - before slowing slightly to 3.2% in 2027. Speaking to the BBC, IMF chief economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas said: \"We have a picture of a global economy that is growing at - it's not outsized growth rates but it's quite resilient, quite robust.\"In a sense the global economy has been shaking off the trade disruptions of 2025, and it's coming out ahead of what we were expecting.\"He said while the effects of Trumps' tariffs has been \"definitely to slow down global activity\", he added that there \"have been other things that have been more than offsetting\".The IMF's report says the global economy has been helped by \"tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)\".However, it said risks to the global outlook \"remain tilted to the downside\", warning that if expectations about AI growth turn out to be overly optimistic an abrupt market correction could be triggered.Even a relatively mild market correction could have an impact, Gourinchas said, given how much share price gains have contributed to wealth gains in recent years. Other risks are emerging as firms increasingly take on debt to make AI investments.\"It doesn't take as much of a market reaction to have an impact on people's wealth relative to their income so that they start cutting consumption, [businesses start] changing their investment plans etc, so there could be some vulnerability there,\" he said.As well as an end to the AI boom, another possible risk highlighted by the IMF was that \"trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity\".\"Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices.\"The IMF estimates the UK grew by 1.4% in 2025, slightly up from its previous projection of 1.3%. Its forecast for this year remains unchanged at 1.3%, which would make it the third fastest growing economy in the G7 behind the US and Canada. It predicts 1.5% growth in 2027.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF had upgraded the UK's growth for the third time since April 2025, and the country was \"on course to be the fastest growing European G7 economy this year and next\".But shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"A 0.1% uptick is not a triumph and the fact Rachel Reeves is celebrating it shows how desperate she has become.\"The IMF expects global inflation to fall from an estimated 4.1% in 2025 to 3.8% in 2026 and further to 3.4% the following year. In the UK, Gourinchas said price changes in regulated industries, such as transport and energy, had kept inflation elevated last year but \"that's going to fade away\".The IMF expects UK inflation to return to the 2% target by the end of the year, as a weakening labour market continues to keep wage growth down.EPAUS Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell revealed last week he was the subject of a  criminal investigationThe IMF warned that central bank independence was \"paramount for macroeconomic stability and economic growth\".\"Preserving the independence of central banks, both legal and operational, remains critical for avoiding the risk of fiscal dominance, anchoring inflation expectations, and enabling them to achieve their mandates,\" it said.It comes a week after US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said he was the subject of an \"unprecedented\" US justice department criminal investigation over his testimony about the bank's building renovations.He said he believed this was due to Donald Trump's anger over the Fed not cutting interest rates, but Trump said he did not know about the investigation.Powell's comments prompted central bank heads across the world to declare \"full solidarity\" with the US Fed chief, while three former heads of the bank strongly criticised the investigation.Gourinchas said preserving central bank independence would be key to economic success in the years ahead.Without it, he warned, \"the economic environment deteriorates pretty rapidly\".Gourinchas said challenges to central bank independence had emerged elsewhere, particularly in countries with big borrowing needs, as leaders are enticed by the idea that lower interest rates would make it less expensive to fund government spending.But he warned those dynamics tend to lead to inflation and higher borrowing costs over time.\"The evidence is very clear. It's self defeating,\" he said.",

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will dissolve parliament on Friday, paving the way for an early election on 8 February that she hopes will translate her strong public polling into a big majority in the lower house.It was an \"extremely weighty decision\" that would \"determine Japan's course together with the people\", Takaichi told a news conference in Tokyo.The country's first female leader and her cabinet have enjoyed high public support since taking office last October.But her party lags behind in polls and the move is risky. It's Japan's second general election in as many years and will test appetite for her plans to boost public spending when cost-of-living is top of voters' minds.Having been elected as prime minister by lawmakers on 21 October, Takaichi is now seeking a public mandate in the House of Representatives, the more powerful house in Japan.Since the day she took office, Takaichi said, she has been \"constantly concerned that the Takaichi cabinet has not yet been tested in an election where the public chooses the government\".\"Is Sanae Takaichi fit to be prime minister? I wanted to ask the sovereign people to decide,\" she told the news conference.Campaigning for the vote to elect the 465 lower house MPs, who serve four-year terms, starts on 27 January.Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955. It currently has 199 seats - including three held by its independent partners - in the House of Representatives, the most of any party. The LDP's coalition with the Japan Innovation party gives it a fragile majority, with just enough seats to govern. A protege of former conservative PM Shinzo Abe and self-professed admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known as Japan's \"Iron Lady\". She came into office promising an economic upturn after years of stagnation.Takaichi is an advocate of heavy government-led spending to drive economic growth - a revival of the sort of stimulus measures that Japan saw under \"Abenomics\". Her first few months in office have seen soaring personal poll ratings - no Japanese PM has been popular since Abe, in 2012.In December, her cabinet approved a record defence budget of nine trillion yen ($57bn; £43bn). This comes amid growing concern over China, with Tokyo describing its neighbour's military activities in the region as its \"greatest strategic challenge\".Takaichi has found herself the target of China's ire since last November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. The diplomatic spat that ensued has sent bilateral ties plunging to their lowest point in more than a decade.Meanwhile, Takaichi has pursued closer ties with the US. During US President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last October, the two leaders heaped praise on each other and signed a deal on rare earths. They also signed a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations.Opinion polls show that while the LDP remains broadly unpopular among Japanese residents, Takaichi and her government have charted approval ratings of 60-80%.This popularity is what Takaichi hopes can help the LDP secure a \"sole majority\" in parliament and push through bolder policies more easily, Dr Seijiro Takeshita, a management professor at the University of Shizuoka, told the BBC World Service's Asia Specific podcast.\"She wants to solidify her position to make things smoother at a later stage,\" Takeshita said.But the snap election gamble comes with its own set of risks.The LDP's leadership has been on shaky ground, and Takaichi is the country's fourth PM in five years. Her predecessors' terms were cut short by falling public support and scandals.Her immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, also announced a snap election shortly after taking office - leading to one of the LDP's worst ever results and costing the party its majority in the House of Representatives.Another challenge looms in the form of a new, consolidated opposition, the Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed last week by Japan's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and the Komeito party, the LDP's former coalition partner.Takaichi said the dissolution of parliament was being carried out only \"after establishing a thorough system\" which ensures there is no disruption to economic policies affecting livelihoods and rising prices.What Takaichi is hoping for is that \"people will trust her to deliver on her promises\", Dr Jeffrey Kingston, an Asian studies professor at Temple University in the US, told the BBC.Her high approval ratings are \"only going to decline so she wants to lock in the benefits of a long honeymoon\", he added.",

    "body": "China's birth rates sunk to a record low in 2025, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost it, as the country's population fell for the fourth straight year.Government data on Monday showed that the country's birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968.Its population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year.Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children.In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021.More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.",

    "body": "19 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersIsrael's leader Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a meeting with his top advisers to discuss US President Donald Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, after Israel said it was not included in talks about the makeup of one of the board's lower bodies. The US on Saturday named the first members of the Gaza Executive Board - including Turkey's foreign minister, a Qatari official, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Netanyahu's office has since said this was \"not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy\". The Board of Peace is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war and is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza.The exact structure of the board, which will also manage Gaza's reconstruction, remains unclear and members are still being invited.The \"Gaza Executive Board\" will be responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), according to a statement released by the White House. A second body, the \"founding Executive Board\" - which also includes Kushner and Blair - will have a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy.So far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: \"The Gaza Strip does not need any \"administrative committee\" to oversee its \"rehabilitation\" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists\".Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a \"diplomatic failure for Israel.\"Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel.The overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said.While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited.Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role.The White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\".The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC.On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute $1bn (£745m) to join the panel.Speaking to CBS news, a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything. Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Sunday, he made clear that Canada did not have \"unimpeded\" aid funds to cover the costs of membership.  Meanwhile, the United Nations warned on Saturday that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is \"far from over\". The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter.Olga Cherevko from the UN aid coordination office said that the delivery of tonnes of aid and the fixing of roads in the months since a ceasefire came into effect were a \"band aid\" rather than a solution. Bitter winter weather has led to further complications, destroying buildings and making it difficult to access healthcare. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAnna FosterPresenter, Today programmeUN Photo / Alba García RuizAntonio Guterres told the BBC some believe \"the power of law should be replaced by the law of power\"The US is acting with impunity and believes its power matters more than international law, the head of the UN has told the BBC.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, António Guterres said Washington's \"clear conviction\" was that multilateral solutions were irrelevant.What mattered, he continued, was the \"exercise of the power and influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law\".His comments come weeks after the US struck Venezuela and seized its president - and in the context of Donald Trump's repeated threats to annex Greenland.Guterres said he believed the founding principles of the UN - including the equality of member states - were now under threat.President Trump has previously been scathing in his criticism of the United Nations.He used his address at last September's General Assembly to question its very purpose, claiming he had \"ended seven unendable wars\" on his own and the UN \"did not even try to help in any of them\".\"Later I realised that the UN wasn't there for us,\" he said.Presented with this damning assessment, Guterres admitted his organisation was struggling to make members abide by the international laws laid out in the UN Charter.The UN was \"extremely engaged\" in solving major global conflicts, he insisted. \"But the UN has no leverage - the big powers have stronger leverage.He questioned whether that extra leverage was being used to produce real and enduring solutions to those conflicts, or just quick fixes. \"There is a big difference between the two things,\" he noted.Guterres also said his organisation needed reform to tackle \"dramatic problems and challenges\" facing its 193 members.\"There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power,\" the UN chief said.\"Indeed, when one sees the present policy of the United States, there is a clear conviction that multilateral solutions are not relevant and that what matters is the exercise of the power and the influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law\".He suggested the UN Security Council - designed to maintain international peace and security - no longer represented the world and was \"ineffective\".Any one of the council's permanent members - France, China, Russia, the UK or US - can currently veto resolutions. Both Russia and the US have used this power to frustrate global efforts to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.Guterres claimed vetoes were being used to further individual members' interests, and criticised the fact that \"three European countries\" were permanent members.He called for changes to the council's composition - to \"regain legitimacy\" and \"give voice to the whole world\" - and to limit veto powers to avoid unacceptable \"blockages\".ReutersGuterres, whose term as secretary general is coming to an end, met Sir Keir Starmer in London last FridayGuterres – a former Portuguese prime minister – took on the job of heading the UN in 2017, and will leave the role at the end of this year.In his annual remarks to the General Assembly, traditionally used to identify the organisation's priorities, he warned of a world in chaos, \"brimming with conflict, impunity, inequality and unpredictability\", and identified \"brazen violations of international law\" as one of the biggest challenges facing the global order.One of the ongoing conflicts Guterres identified as key for the UN was Gaza.For large parts of the war it was prevented from distributing aid in the strip, as Israel blocked international humanitarian organisations from bringing it into the territory.At one point, Israel even backed an external contractor – the Gaza Humanitarian Organisation – to do the work the UN had traditionally carried out for decades. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed trying to access food at GHF sites.When asked if he saw the UN as powerless in Gaza where it should have made a difference, he said: \"Of course, but let's be clear.\"For a long time, Israel was saying that humanitarian aid was not distributed because the UN was not able to do so. Of course, whenever Israel would not allow us to move into Gaza, we couldn't move into Gaza. And then there was a ceasefire, and a massive flow of humanitarian aid.\"He stressed: \"We were ready, provided we had the conditions.\"A few days ago, Guterres told the UN General Assembly that \"1945 problem-solving\" wouldn't solve 2026 problems, referring to the organisation's founding structure.The challenges keep coming, with the US-forced change of leadership in Venezuela, regime forces in Iran killing thousands of protestors and Donald Trump's stated aim of annexing Greenland.Questions about the death of multilateralism - and the failure of some world leaders to speak out and defend the rule of international law - are growing ever-louder.But Antonio Guterres told me he was remaining positive.\"I think that people are sometimes reluctant to confront the powerful. But the truth is that if we don't confront the powerful, we will never be able to have a better world.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

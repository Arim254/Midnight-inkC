    "body": "Jeremy Bowen: Syria feels lighter without the Assads' crushing weight - but now there are new problems2 days agoJeremy BowenInternational EditorBBCA year ago, the war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down.A rebel force had broken out of Idlib, a Syrian province on the border with Turkey, and was storming towards Damascus. It was led by a man known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and his militia group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Jolani was a nom-de-guerre, reflecting his family's roots in the Golan Heights, Syria's southern highlands, annexed by Israel after it was occupied in 1967. His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.One year later, he is interim president, and Bashar al-Assad is in a gilded exile in Russia. Syria is still in ruins. In every city and village I have visited this last 10 days, people were living in skeletal buildings gutted by war. But for all the new Syria's problems, it feels much lighter without the crushing, cruel weight of the Assads.Getty ImagesSyria is still in ruins. In cities and villages, many people are living in skeletal buildings gutted by warSharaa has found the going easier abroad than at home. He has won the argument with Saudi Arabia and the West that he is Syria's best chance of a stable future.In May, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia arranged a brief meeting between Sharaa and US President Donald Trump. Afterwards, Trump called him a \"young attractive tough guy\".At home, Syrians know his weaknesses and the problems Syria faces better than foreigners. Sharaa's writ does not run in the north-east, where the Kurds are in control, or parts of the south where Syrian Druze, another minority sect, want a separate state backed by their Israeli allies. On the coast Alawites – Assad's sect – fear a repeat of the massacres they suffered in March.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump called him a 'young attractive tough guy'A year ago, the new masters of Damascus, like most of the armed rebels in Syria, were Sunni Islamists. Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects. Sunnis are the majority. As well as Kurds and Druze, there are Christians, many of whom find it hard to forget Sharaa's jihadist past.Image of a man who outgrew his jihadist rootsIn the first week of December last year, it was hard to believe that the HTS offensive was moving so fast. It took them three days to capture Aleppo, Syria's northern powerhouse.Compare that with the tortured years between 2012 and 2016, when the regime's army and rebel militias had fought for control of the city: that had ended in victory for Assad after Russia's president Vladimir Putin deployed his air force and artillery to add decisive firepower to the regime's ruthless tactics.When I visited the former rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo a few weeks after they had fallen to the regime, large areas were devastated by Russian bombing. Some streets were blocked by rubble that went up to first-floor balconies.But by the end of 2024, across the country, government troops had melted away. Both reluctant conscripts and regime loyalists were no longer prepared to fight and die for a corrupt and cruel regime that repaid them with poverty and oppression.AFP via Getty ImagesOne year ago - celebrations marking the dawn of a new era for SyriaA few days after Assad fled with his family to Russia, I interviewed Syria's victorious new leader in the presidential palace.It perches high on a crag overlooking Damascus, designed as an ever-visible reminder for the city's citizens of the all-seeing power of the Assads. By then Jolani had discarded his name, along with his combat fatigues.Sharaa sat down in the chilly halls of the unheated palace wearing a smart jacket, pressed trousers and shiny black shoes. He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.Israel dismissed it, however. And jihadist hardliners branded Sharaa as a traitor, selling out his religion and his own history.Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-SharaaI had packed in a hurry to report on a war, never expecting the regime to crumble so fast. My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.A weakened IS in SyriaSharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.The reality is that IS in Syria is weak. Its attacks this year have been mostly against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east.That has changed in the last few weeks, leading up to the anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Getty ImagesThe war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down one year agoAs security forces have raided IS cells, the jihadists have killed three soldiers and two former Assad operatives in cities controlled by the government, according to data collected by Charles Lister, a leading commentator on Syria, and published in a newsletter Syria Weekly. IS social media channels monitored by the BBC continue to tell Syrian Sunnis that Sharaa has betrayed them.Without producing any proof, they have posted claims that he has been an agent of the US and UK, working to undermine the jihadist project.Winning over Trump and the westSharaa's overtures to the west have been remarkably successful.Within two weeks of taking power in Syria, he received a delegation of senior American diplomats. Immediately, the Americans scrapped the $10 million bounty the they had put on his arrest.Since then, sanctions imposed on Assad's Syria have been steadily reduced. The most swingeing, the Caesar Act, has been suspended and could be repealed by the US Congress in the new year.A major milestone came in November when Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit the White House.APTrump sprayed Sharaa with cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take homeTrump's welcome in the Oval Office was relaxed. He sprayed Sharaa with Trump-branded cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take home for his wife, jokingly asking him how many he has. \"One,\" Sharaa answered, as he blinked away clouds of fragrance.Away from the larking around for the cameras, Saudi Arabia as well as western governments see Sharaa as the best bet – the only one – to stabilise a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East. If Syria slipped back into civil war, there would be zero chance of reducing the violent turbulence in the region.One senior western diplomat told me that the conditions for civil war still exist. That is because of the lasting scars of half a century of dictatorship and 14 years of a war that started as an uprising against the Assads' oppressive rule and turned into an increasingly sectarian fight.AFP via Getty ImagesMany western governments see Sharaa as the best bet to stabilise Syria. His minister for foreign affairs, Assad al-Shaibani is front rightSharaa is a Sunni Muslim, Syria's largest religious group. His government does not control the whole country. In the last year he has not been able to persuade, or force, Kurds in the north-east and Druze in the south to accept the authority of Damascus. On the coast, the Alawite community is nervous and restive.The Alawites are a sect that originated in Shia Islam, with their heartland on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The Assads are Alawites.The founder of the regime, Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad, built his power on the Alawite minority, around 10% of the population. Just the sound of the Alawite accent, especially coming from a man in uniform – or worse, a leather-jacketed operative from one of the regime's intelligence agencies – used to make other Syrians nervous.Syria will not recover if sectarian killing continues. Stopping more serious outbreaks of violence in the next 12 months is the government's most serious challenge.The slow pace of justiceJust before the anniversary of Assad's fall, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressed serious concern about the slow pace of justice. A spokesman said, \"While the interim authorities have taken encouraging steps towards addressing past violations, these steps are only the beginning of what needs to be done.\"Some Syrians have taken matters into their own hands, along, at times, with government forces. The OHCHR said that hundreds have been killed over the past year \"by the security forces and affiliated groups, elements associated with the former government, local armed groups and unidentified armed individuals\".They added: \"Other reported violations and abuses include sexual violence, arbitrary detentions, destruction of homes, forced evictions, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"Alawite, Druze, Christian and Bedouin communities were mainly affected by the violence, the OHCHR said, which has been fed by rising hate speech both on- and offline.Anadolu via Getty ImagesA graduation ceremony for general security personnel last monthA big risk for 2026 is a repeat of last March's sectarian violence in Alawite areas.In the security vacuum that followed the fall of the Assad regime, the new government attempted to stamp its authority on the Syrian coast with a series of arrests. An investigation by OCHCR found that \"pro-former government fighters responded by capturing, killing, and injuring hundreds of interim government forces\".Damascus responded harshly and lost control of militant armed factions that carried a systematic series of deadly attacks on Alawites.The UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed in the ensuing massacres. The vast majority were adult men, but victims included approximately 100 women, the elderly and the disabled, as well as children.The Sharaa government cooperated with the UN investigation. Some of its forces managed to rescue Alawites and it has put some of the ringleaders of the massacres on trial. ReutersThe UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed during sectarian violence in Alawite areas in MarchThe UN Syria Commission of Inquiry confirmed it had found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks. But the concern then and for the future was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groups that had supposedly joined its security forces.In July in the southern province of Suweida, serious violence between Druze and Bedouin communities shook the Sharaa administration to its roots. The Druze religion developed out of Islam around a thousand years ago, and its followers, who some Muslims believe are heretics, amount to around 3% of Syria's population.When government forces entered Suweida, supposedly to restore order, they ended up fighting Druze militias. Israel, which has its own Druze community that is fiercely loyal to the Jewish state, intervened. Its airstrikes included the near destruction of the ministry of defence in Damascus. It took a rapid American intervention to force a ceasefire that stopped a spiral down into much worse violence. Tens of thousands of people were driven from their homes and remain displaced.Getty ImagesA UN inquiry found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks in March. But the concern was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groupsThe Israel questionIt is still not clear whether Sharaa and his interim government are strong enough to survive another crisis as serious as that. Israel remains a looming and dangerous presence to Syrians.After the fall of Assad, the Israelis launched a series of major air strikes to destroy what was left of the old regime's military capacity. The IDF advanced out of the occupied Golan Heights to take control of more Syrian territory, which it still holds.The Israelis were taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to weaken a country it saw as hostile, destroying weapons it said might be turned in its direction.More from InDepthAttempts by the US to broker a security agreement between Israel and Syria have stalled in the last two months or so.Syria wants to return to an agreement originally negotiated by Henry Kissinger when he was US Secretary of State in 1974. Netanyahu wants Israel to stay in the land it seized and has demanded that Syria demilitarises a large area south of Damascus.In the last month Israel has intensified its ground incursions into Syria. Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November. The IDF said they were arresting Sunni militants who were planning attacks. Local men fought back, wounding six Israelis as the raiding party was forced into a hurried retreat, abandoning a military vehicle that they later destroyed with an airstrike. The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel. The Damascus government called it a war crime. Calls for retaliation intensified.Dia Images via Getty ImagesThe border village of Beit Jinn was raided by IDF troops on 28 NovemberIn Washington, Trump was clearly worried by the raid. He posted on his Truth Social platform that he was \"very satisfied\" with Sharaa's efforts at stabilising Syria.He warned that it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous state\".In Beit Jinn I met Khalil Abu Daher on his way back from hospital, his arm in plaster after surgery for a bullet wound. He invited me to his home, which is close to where the Israelis were exchanging fire with village men.Khalil told me he was here with his family when the Israelis entered the village at 3:30 am. They tried to find a safe place.\"I was in my house with my children. We went from one room to another. They shot at my two daughters. One was hit, and the other died instantly. When I picked her up, I was shot in the hand.\"The dead girl was 17-year-old Hiba Abu Daher, who was shot in the stomach. They sheltered, Khalil said, alongside Hiba's dead body for two hours before they were rescued and taken to hospital.When I visited, Khalil's nine-year-old daughter was lying on a blanket on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hip.Khalil's nine-year-old daughter lying on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hipThe girls' mother, Umm Mohammad, sat with the women of the family, desperately worried about the future.\"We want peace of mind,\" she told me. \"We want to live in our homes, and we want a clinic and medical staff because we don't have one.\"We also want a doctor because there isn't one in Beit Jinn, nor is there a pharmacy. We want security.\"'We go to sleep and wake up afraid'A year after the end of Assad's rule, Syria's new rulers have scored some important achievements. They are still in power, which was not guaranteed when they took Damascus. President Trump has become Sharaa's most important backer. Sanctions are being lifted. The economy is showing signs of life and business deals are being done, including modernising oil and gas installations and privatising the airports in Damascus and Aleppo.But deals that are in the pipeline have not yet changed the lives of most Syrians. The government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individuals. Sectarian tensions are unresolved and could ignite again. The US-mediated dialogue with Israel has stalled.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individualsBenjamin Netanyahu insists that Damascus might demilitarise a large area of southern Syria and shows no signs of ordering the IDF to pull back. Both points amount to a major violation of Syrian sovereignty. The Beit Jinn raid makes it harder for Damascus to offer concessions.Government in Damascus is centred on Sharaa himself, assisted by the foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani and a few trusted associates. No serious attempt seems to be happening to create an accountable framework of government.Syria without the Assad family is a better place. But Umm Mohammad summed up the feelings of far too many Syrians.\"The future is difficult. We have nothing, not even schools. Our children are living in hell here. There is no safety for them. How will we live?\"We want safety. We go to sleep and wake up afraid.\"Top picture credits: AFP via Getty Images and Anadolu via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoDearbail JordanWorkers rescued from Jakarta office building fireA fire at an office building in Jakarta has killed at least 22 people as authorities continue to search for casualties.The blaze at the seven-storey site in the Indonesian capital started on Tuesday afternoon, according to city police chief Susatyo Purnomo Condro, who said some workers were having lunch at the time.Police believe the fire began after a battery exploded on the first floor before the flames spread upwards. A company which makes drones is based in the building.   Susatyo said most of the victims who perished were women, one of whom was pregnant, and it was likely that they had died of asphyxiation from smoke rather than burns. Thick smoke poured from the upper floors as firefighters deployed 28 engines and about 100 personnel, with dramatic footage showing trapped employees being rescued by aerial ladders.The fire has been extinguished and rescue teams are focusing on the upper levels of the building after conducting a sweep of the lower floors.Susatyo said that access to the sixth floor was \"particularly challenging, according to the firefighters on site\", the Jakarta Globe newspaper reports.\"We are still collecting data,\" he told the Associated Press news agency. \"But for now, we are focusing on identifying the victims who have been found.\"The company provides drone services for industrial clients, from aerial surveying and mapping to inspection and agriculture.",

    "body": "17 hours agoKhashayar Joneidi, BBC Persian CorrespondentThe US has deported a second group of Iranian nationals, officials in Tehran said, as the Trump administration continues its immigration enforcement efforts.A chartered plane carrying more than 50 Iranians flew out of Mesa, Arizona, on Sunday, travelling through Cairo and Kuwait before arriving in Iran, according to reports.   Tehran's foreign ministry confirmed the Iranian nationals' return to Iran. US immigration officials could not \"confirm or deny a flight\" for security reasons.The first deportation flight took off from the US in late September, in a rare instance of cooperation between Iran and the US. Many Iranian nationals say they come to the US because they fear persecution at home.Father Joseph Bach, a member of Borderland Companions of Hope, a Franciscan organisation that provides support to migrants, said he has been informed through his contacts inside an Arizona detention facility that Christian converts were among those removed. He also said some detainees had identified as LGBT.Christian converts and members of the LGBT community are groups that face severe legal and social repercussions in Iran.Father Joseph called the deportations \"the most unchristian thing to do\", adding, \"It's scary, it concerns me, it is not OK. I call this a death flight.\"Iranian authorities have facilitated the repatriation efforts. An Iranian consular official said the deported nationals had \"announced their willingness for return following continuation of anti-immigration and discriminative policy against foreign nationals, particularly Iranians, by the United States\", the Iran's judiciary-affiliated Mizan News Agency reports.However, one detainee who spoke with the BBC said not all those who were deported were willing to return.One person who was on a list for potential deportation told the BBC he and his partner crossed into the US on foot from Mexico earlier this year. Speaking from an immigration detention centre in Arizona, he said he feared for his life if he returned to Iran.The latest deportations come as already severely strained relations between the two countries further deteriorated in June, after the US bombed Iran's nuclear facilities.The removals highlight the US government's hardline immigration posture under President Donald Trump, who made border security and reducing unauthorised migration central to his political agenda.",

    "body": "7 minutes agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentA press conference by María Corina Machado - the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who is currently in-hiding - was cancelled on Tuesday, with the Nobel Institute saying they are \"in the dark\" about her whereabouts.  Machado is Venezuela's opposition leader and has been in hiding since the country's disputed 2024 election, which she and her supporters say was stolen.She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela, and was expected to formally collect it in a ceremony on Wednesday. Although Machado regularly gives social media video updates, usually against a neutral white wall, her current whereabouts are unknown.The Nobel Institute said in a statement: \"María Corina Machado has herself stated in interviews how challenging the journey to Oslo, Norway will be. We therefore cannot at this point provide any further information about when and how she will arrive for the Nobel peace prize ceremony.\"The institute had previously said she would attend the ceremony in person. Earlier on Tuesday, a spokesman said \"everything suggests\"  the press conference would be able to take place on Tuesday despite the delay. Venezuela's government has said that if Machado left Venezuela she would be considered a \"fugitive\" by the authorities. Her family are already in Oslo.Venezuela's attorney general, Tarek William Saab, told AFP last month: \"By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive\". He said she is accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism\".Machado had earlier told her followers that she would return to Venezuela after collecting the prize.If she attends, it would be her first public appearance since January 2025. She last appeared in public at a protest in Caracas on 9 January against the inauguration of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.After Venezuela's 2024 election, the opposition published tallies after the election suggesting it won, despite Maduro claiming victory, and some nations including the US have recognised its candidate - Edmundo Gonzalez - as the president-elect. Ms Machado was banned from running in the election.",

    "body": "15 hours agoReutersThe nightclub is located in a busy tourist areaThe owners of a nightclub in Goa, India, where a devastating fire killed 25 people on Sunday, fled the country hours after the tragedy, police have said.Indian authorities confirmed the two brothers, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, boarded a flight to Phuket in Thailand shortly after the incident.Investigators believe the fierce blaze was triggered by fireworks being set off inside the venue, Birch By Romeo Lane, which is located in a busy nightlife area of Goa, a coastal state popular with domestic and international tourists.The majority of the victims were staff members, while four were holidaymakers visiting from Delhi. Five people are still being treated in hospital.Police have appealed to Interpol for help to find and arrest the Luthra brothers.Police said they travelled to Delhi to carry out a raid on the mens' home, but  discovered they had left the country. \"It shows their intent to avoid police investigation,\" Goa police said in a statement. Saurabh Luthra, whose social media identifies him as the chairman of the company which operates the club, posted a statement on social media expressing \"profound grief\", but did not reference his whereabouts.\"In this hour the irreparable sorrow and overwhelming distress, the management stands in unwavering solidarity with the families of the deceased as well as those injured, and conveys its heartfelt condolences with utmost sincerity,\" Monday's post said.It added that \"management\" would provide \"assistance, support and cooperation to the bereaved\".His brother Gaurav Luthra has not commented publicly.At least four people were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the fire, including the venue's manager.The Birch nightclub in Arpora, an area with several high-end nightlife businesses, was packed with customers who had come to hear a Bollywood DJ when the fire broke out in the early hours of the morning.Eye witnesses have described scenes of total panic to the BBC, as people tried to flee.The main section of the venue is built on an island in the middle of a lake, which visitors accessed via narrow walkways - a layout which made it difficult for firefighters to tackle the blaze.Part of the venue was entirely destroyed. Police initially said an exploding gas canister was the cause, but now believe it was due to pyrotechnics igniting wooden ceiling beams.Several of the victims were migrant workers who had travelled to Goa to find employment, including four Nepalese nationals.Among those who died were two brothers who were both engaged to be married next year, and four members of the same Delhi family.The police said the bodies of all the victims had been returned to their families.

    "body": "Twelve fired FBI agents are alleging that they were unlawfully sacked because they knelt during a racial justice protest in Washington DC five years ago.In a recently filed lawsuit, the former agents argue that their decision to kneel - adopting a gesture used by demonstrators - helped to deescalate a tense protest situation in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.The agents believe they were fired on the orders of FBI boss Kash Patel, who is named as a defendant.Their termination letters accused them of \"a lack of impartiality\" in their duties, they say. The FBI has declined to comment on the case.The dozen sacked agents - nine women and three men - say they had been \"confronted by a mob\" when deployed in the US capital city on 4 June 2020, and were responding to a \"dangerous situation\" for which they were ill-prepared. The killing of Floyd, a black man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis had sparked protests across the US and in cities around the world just days earlier.Amid a febrile atmosphere during the protest in the US capital city, the plaintiffs made what was a \"considered tactical decision\" to take a knee, the group said in their legal filing, which gave their account of events. They said they \"avoided triggering violence by assuming a kneeling posture\" which had been used to lessen tensions \"between law enforcement officers and their communities during this period of national unrest\".They say their actions were reviewed at the time by both the FBI and the Department of Justice, of which the FBI is a part. They highlighted that their dismissal letters came more than five years after the incident.The agents are seeking reinstatement in their positions and back pay.In their complaint, the ex-agents said they had been \"targeted\" because their choice of tactics on that day had led to a \"perceived lack of affiliation\" with President Donald Trump, who was in office during the protests.During his tenure leading the FBI, Patel has been accused of a wider crackdown on personnel perceived to be disloyal to his ally Trump. He has previously denied accusations that his sackings at the agency have been politically motivated.Amid recent speculation regarding his future at the top of the agency, the White House said Patel was \"a critical member of the president's team and he is working tirelessly to restore integrity to the FBI.\"The civil case from the 12 former agents, which was filed in the District of Columbia, comes after former FBI acting director Brian Driscoll and others filed a lawsuit of their own, alleging that they too had been terminated in an act of political retribution.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has criticised European leaders as \"weak\" and suggested the US could scale back support for Ukraine.In a wide-ranging interview with Politico, he said \"decaying\" European countries had failed to control migration or take decisive action to end Ukraine's war with Russia, accusing them of letting Kyiv fight \"until they drop\". European leaders have made attempts to carve out a role in the US-led efforts to end the war, which they fear will undercut the long-term interests of the continent in favour of a quick resolution.In response, the UK's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said all she saw in Europe was \"strength\", citing investment in defence as well as funding for Kyiv.She added two presidents were \"working for peace\" - referring to Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - and \"one president - President Putin - has so far simply sought to escalate the conflict with further drone and missile attacks\".Trump continued to increase pressure on Zelensky to agree to a deal to end the conflict, and urged him to \"play ball\" by ceding territory to Moscow. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Zelensky, writing on X later on Tuesday, said Ukraine and Europe were working actively on \"all components of potential steps toward ending the war\", that the Ukrainian and European elements of the plan were now more developed and that Kyiv was ready to present them to \"our partners in the US\".Trump's latest public criticism of Europe comes a day after European leaders came together in London to discuss their continued joint efforts to stop the fighting in Ukraine.Asked whether Europe could help end the war, the US president said: \"They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on.\"US officials have held separate talks with Ukrainian and Russian officials in recent weeks in an attempt to broker an end to the war. So far, no agreement has been reached.Ukraine's president has pressed European and Nato leaders to help deter the US from backing a deal that Kyiv fears would leave it exposed to future attack.On Sunday Trump suggested, without evidence, that Zelensky was the main obstacle to peace. He told reporters that Russia was \"fine\" with the peace plan outlined to both sides by the US, that contained major concessions for Ukraine and which allies feared would leave it vulnerable to a future invasion.In the Politico interview, he claimed Ukrainian negotiators \"loved\" the US-backed proposal and alleged Zelensky had not yet read it.Trump also claimed ideological divisions now threatened to fracture Washington's alliances with Europe.Asked whether leaders he viewed as weak could still be allies, he replied: \"It depends\", adding: \"I think they're weak, but I also think that they want to be so politically correct. I think they don't know what to do.\"The president's remarks came after his administration released its new 33-page National Security Strategy, which warned of Europe's potential \"civilisational erasure\" and questioned whether some nations could remain reliable allies. Russia welcomed that strategy - which did not cast Russia as a threat to the US - as \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision.Trump also warned on Tuesday many countries in Europe \"will not be viable countries any longer\" if they keep on the way they are going, adding: \"What they're doing with immigration is a disaster.\"He singled out Hungary and Poland as doing a \"very good job\" on immigration, but said most European nations were \"decaying\".Responding on Tuesday to the strategy, German chancellor Friedrich Merz said some parts were plausible and some understandable, but other elements were unacceptable from a European point of view. He rejected the idea that the US needed to \"save democracy\" in Europe, saying Europeans could address such questions themselves.The strategy also followed similar rhetoric to Trump's speech to the UN earlier this year, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy.",

    "body": "At least 30 people were injured after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit north-eastern Japan on Monday night, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes.The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31mi), about 80km off the coast of the Aomori region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It prompted tsunami warnings which have now been lifted, while waves of 70cm (27in) were seen.Some train services have been suspended and thousands of homes have been left without power as a result. Authorities have also warned that a stronger tremor could occur in the coming days - urging the public to remain on high alert for at least a week, according to local media reports.Addressing citizens affected by the earthquake, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said: \"Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking.\"Orders were issued for about 90,000 residents to evacuate, according to Reuters news agency.The Aomori prefectural government said around 2,700 homes have been left without power. East Japan Railway has also suspended some services along the north-eastern coast.The Japanese government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre and convened an emergency team, chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara has said.\"We are making every effort to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures, including rescue and relief operations,\" he added.Following the tremors, Japanese electric company Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said.None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency.Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011.That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year.Earlier this year, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, with worst-case scenarios suggesting it would cause trillions in damage, and potentially kill hundreds of thousands.Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - have already been responsible for thousands of deaths.",

    "body": "16 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesNew York City Mayor-Elect Zohran MamdaniNew York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani will live in the Manhattan mansion that his predecessors have called home, leaving behind a rent-stabilised apartment that became the subject of heated debate during his campaign.Gracie Mansion, which dates to 1799, has served as the residence for most New York City mayors since World War Two. But Mamdani, for whom affordable housing is a central issue, did not confirm he would live there immediately following his victory in November.\"This decision came down to our family's safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for,\" Mamdani said in a statement on Monday.He has been living in the Astoria neighbourhood in the borough of Queens. The area, home to many middle-class families, is famous for its abundance of immigrant communities and global cuisine.\"To Astoria: thank you for showing us the best of New York City,\" Mamdani's statement said.\"While I may no  longer live in Astoria, Astoria will always live inside me and the work I do.\"During his campaign, Mamdani tied his core platform - freeze the rent – to his own housing situation. But his rivals, mainly former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, criticised Mamdani for occupying the apartment even though he came from a famous family. His mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesGracie Mansion, built in 1799, is the official residence of the New York City mayorNot every mayor has chosen to live at Gracie Mansion.Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire entrepreneur and founder of the eponymous financial and media company, chose to live in his own townhouse on the Upper East Side neighbourhood of Manhattan during his three terms, which ended in 2012.Bloomberg said he believed Gracie Mansion should be a space for public city functions, and he pushed for an extensive renovation of the ageing property.When Mamdani moves in, sometime around his inauguration on 1 January, he will find himself in surroundings very different than his modest Astoria digs.With its butter yellow paint, green shutters, and white railings, Gracie Mansion is a wedding cake of a house overlooking the East River. Inside, the lower floor of the Federal-style mansion is decorated in the spirit of the home's original era.The compound, which reportedly has five bedrooms, also has enhanced security to protect the mayor and their family.Some residents have alleged that Gracie Mansion also has supernatural lodgers. Chirlane McCray, the wife of former mayor Bill De Blasio, told reporters that doors occasionally opened and closed by themselves, and the floorboards creaked eerily.Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams was more certain. \"I don't care what anyone says,\" he declared in 2022. \"There are ghosts in there, man.\"Mamdani's current apartment is rent stabilised, meaning the city sets limits on how much landlords can raise the rent each year. New Yorkers consider these apartments valuable lifelines as the cost of housing outpaces what many can afford.Records showed Mamdani paid about $2,300 (£1,725) each month for his apartment. According to the real estate platform Zillow, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City is $3,500 (£2,625) a month.",

    "body": "1 day agoMadeline HalpertGetty ImagesFTC member Rebecca Slaughter sued Trump after she and another Democratic-appointed member were fired in MarchThe US Supreme Court's conservative majority appeared to side on Monday with the Trump administration in a case that could have major implications for the independence of federal agencies long shielded from the White House. The case, Trump v Slaughter, stems from President Donald Trump's firing in March of Rebecca Slaughter, alongside another Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).The court heard more than two hours of arguments over whether Trump could fire her, since federal law says an commissioner can only be fired for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\". The court's decision is not expected to be announced for several months.Ms Slaughter sued Trump after she was ousted earlier this year for being \"inconsistent with [the] Administration's priorities\". Trump has argued that a president should be able to have full control over government agencies, even those set up by Congress to be shielded from presidential interference.When the FTC was established in 1914 - to protect the public from deceptive business practices and unfair competition - Congress passed a law saying a president could only remove commissioners for cause and that the five-member commission can have no more than three members of the same political party. Trump appointed Ms Slaughter in 2018 to fill a Democratic position on the FTC, and she was later reappointed by former President Joe Biden. Similar firing rules exist for other independent agencies like the National Labor Relations Board. The law was put to the test in 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt tried to remove a member of the FTC, leading the Supreme Court to uphold the independence of certain federal agencies like the trade commission.  In the 90-year-old ruling known as Humphrey's Executor, the court found that, while the president has the ability to remove executive officers without cause, such a power does not apply to agencies like the FTC that are \"neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative\".During oral arguments on Monday, the four conservative justices on the court appeared to disagree with Ms Slaughter's lawyers' arguments that this would be an unacceptable expansion of Trump's powers.Arguing for the Trump administration, US Solicitor General John Sauer called the Humphrey's rule an \"indefensible outlier\" and \"decaying husk\" of a Supreme Court decision that should be overturned.\"I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,\" said conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch.The three liberal justices pressed why the court would overturn a 90-year-old precedent.\"You're asking us to destroy the structure of government,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, \"and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.\"Justice Elena Kagan suggested that allowing Trump to remove Ms Slaughter could have wide-reaching impacts, asking: \"The question is, where does this lead?\"\"Employees are wielding executive power all over the place, and yet we've had civil service laws that give them substantial protection from removal for over a century,\" she said.Lawyer Amit Agarwal, representing Ms Slaughter, said independent auditing groups like the FTC  have a long history in US politics.\"Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790. So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start,\" he said.The court has already issued one ruling against Ms Slaughter, which analysts suggested could indicate how it would ultimately rule.A lower court ruled that Ms Slaughter had been illegally removed from the FTC, leading the Trump administration to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. In a 6-3 decision, the conservative-majority court in September issued an emergency order maintaining her firing until the case could be heard. The Supreme Court is also set to take up at a later date a separate case on whether Trump had the power to remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. ",

    "body": "Thieves snatch eight Matisse artworks from library in Brazil20 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterWatch: CCTV captures Matisse heist suspects making off with artworks on foot in São PauloTwo armed men have stolen eight engravings by French artist Matisse and at least another five by Brazilian painter Cândido Portinari from a library in São Paulo.  Brazilian officials say the thieves held up a security guard and an elderly couple who were visiting the library on Sunday, before making off with the artworks on foot.On Monday, authorities said they had found the \"escape vehicle\", and several hours later one of the suspects had been arrested, authorities said.The heist comes less than two months after the art world was rocked by a brazen break-in at the Louvre museum in Paris, where thieves made off with priceless jewels. The engravings stolen from Biblioteca Mário de Andrade formed part of a joint exhibition with the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art.The thieves targeted the exhibition, entitled From Book to Museum, on its final day.They reportedly entered the library by the main entrance at 10:00 (13:00 GMT) on Sunday, and left by the same route, heading towards the nearest metro station.Bibilioteca Mário de Andrade is the country's second largest library and officials say that its building in the centre of São Paulo has cameras with facial recognition technology. The city itself also has an extensive security camera system. Brazilian news website G1 published a video purporting to show the two men rushing along a road, carrying between them what seems to be a sack with paintings in it.In a statement posted online, the São Paulo government said that the first alleged thief had been arrested following \"analysis of security cameras that recorded the criminal act\".Officials have not yet released a detailed list of the stolen works, but according to Folha de São Paulo newspaper, a collage Matisse made for the limited-edition art book Jazz is among those taken.Matisse is widely considered to be one of the 20th Century's most influential artists and art critics say the value of the stolen works is \"incalculable\".The thieves also took at least five engravings by Portinari, created to illustrate a special edition of the novel Menino de engheno (Plantation Boy) by Brazilian writer José Lins do Rego.Portinari, who often painted rural workers and labourers, is one of the most significant Brazilian Modernist artists.

    "body": "7 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterThe EU has opened an investigation into Google over its artificial intelligence (AI) summaries which appear above search results.The European Commission said it would examine whether the firm used data from websites to provide this service - and if it failed to offer \"appropriate compensation\" to publishers.It is also investigating how YouTube videos may have been used to improve its broader AI systems, and whether content creators were able to opt-out.A Google spokesperson said the probe \"risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever\".\"Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era,\" they said.The EU's investigation will also cover Google's AI Mode, which gives people an answer in a conversational style with some links to other pages.It is in addition to the tech giant's existing search platform - providing an experience similar to its rivals such as ChatGPT.What is AI and how does it work?Google's introduction of its AI Overview summaries was met with concerns it could result in fewer visitors to websites.Without people clicking on web pages, sites generate less money from advertising.The Daily Mail previously claimed the number of people who clicked its links from Google search results fell by around 50% since Google introduced its AI Overview feature.The Commission said it was concerned both web publishers and YouTube video creators were not being compensated or given the opportunity to opt-out of their content being used to train the company's AI models.Ed Newton-Rex from AI fairness campaigners Fairly Trained said it was \"career suicide\" for people to not publish their work on YouTube or online.He told the BBC Google \"essentially makes it a condition\" of online publishing that the firm can \"use your work to build AI that competes with you\".\"This investigation could not come at a more critical time for creators around the world,\" he said.And the move was also welcomed by Rosa Curling, co-executive director of campaign group Foxglove - which had called on the Commission in June to tackle the impact of AI Overviews on independent media organisations.But she said \"clear and present\" dangers to journalism and democracy remain.\"We need an urgent opt out for news publishers to stop Google from stealing their reporting today – not when this investigation is finished,\" she said.\"Otherwise, there will be little left, by the time the Commission is ready to act.\"The Commission's investigation comes down to whether Google has used the work of other people published online to build its own AI tools which it can profit from.Its generative AI systems are capable of producing text, images and video in seconds, in response to simple text prompts.Many firms can now do this - and they have used huge volumes of online web content to train their underlying systems.But creatives have voiced concern their work may have formed the basis for big tech's AI products and outputs, at the expense of their own rights or livelihoods.\"A free and democratic society depends on diverse media, open access to information, and a vibrant creative landscape,\" said Commission executive vice-president Teresa Ribera.She said AI was ushering in \"remarkable innovation\" and \"many benefits for people and businesses\" - but its growth should not come at the cost of the EU's values.But the Commission's recent enforcement of its tough digital rules - which can see tech companies face huge fines if they found to be breaching them - has been met with outrage from US lawmakers.Elon Musk's platform X axed the Commission's account for placing adverts on the site, after the EU brandished a €120m (£105m) fine over its blue verification badges.",

    "body": "8 hours agoWedaeli ChibelushiandAnna Holligan,The HagueThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has sentenced a Sudanese militia leader to 20 years in prison for atrocities committed during a civil war more than two decades ago.Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman had been convicted in October on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region.Known as Ali Kushayb, he was one of the leaders of the Janjaweed, a government-backed group that terrorised Darfur, killing hundreds of thousands of people.Kushayb, aged 76, is the first person to be tried by the ICC for atrocities committed during the civil war. He had argued the charges were a case of mistaken identity.Dressed in a light blue suit and tie, Kushayb stood quietly as presiding judge Joanna Korner delivered his sentence on Tuesday.\"Abdal Raman not only gave the orders which led directly to the crimes but... also personally perpetrated some of them,\" Judge Korner told the court.The conflict in question lasted from 2003 to 2020 and was one of the world's gravest humanitarian disasters, with allegations of ethnic cleansing and genocide against the region's non-Arabic population.Five years after the end of that crisis, Darfur is a key battleground in another civil war, this time between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), whose origins lie in the Janjaweed.BBC hears of horror and hunger in rare visit to Darfur massacre townReturn of the feared JanjaweedSudan war: A simple guide to what is happeningDuring Kushayb's trial, survivors described how their villages were burned down, men and boys slaughtered and women forced into sex slavery.Judge Korner said Kushayb had given orders to \"wipe out and sweep away\" non-Arab tribes and told soldiers \"don't leave anyone behind. Bring no one alive.\"The charges against Kushayb centred on attacks committed between 2003 and 2004.The Darfur war began after the Arab-dominated government at the time armed the Janjaweed, in an attempt to suppress an uprising by rebels from black African ethnic groups. The Janjaweed systematically attacked non-Arab villagers accused of supporting the rebels, leading to accusations of genocide.That same systematic violence is still happening in Darfur as part of Sudan's current civil war.Many of the Janjaweed fighters went on to join the RSF.The UK, US and rights groups have accused the RSF of carrying out ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities in Darfur since the conflict began in 2023. The RSF has denied the accusations.When passing Kushayb's sentence, Judge Korner said the ICC wanted to ensure both \"retribution and deterrence\".\"Deterrence is particularly apposite in this case given the current state of affairs in Sudan,\" she said.Throughout the two conflicts, there has been a \"long hiring out of militias, suppressing of rebellion, and sexual violence used as a tool of war\", Dr Matthew Benson-Strohmayer, Sudan Research Director at the London School of Economics, told the BBC.\"I think the way that the war is being fought in Darfur in particular is really a war of terror,\" he told the BBC.At the time of the verdict, Dr Benson-Strohmayer said he hoped the conviction would impact the current conflict, but \"sincerely\" doubted it will.Most victims of the first Darfur crisis remain displaced, and although the ICC has managed to prosecute Kushayb, there are still outstanding arrest warrants against Sudanese officials, including one accusing former President Omar al-Bashir of genocide, which he denies.Bashir is reportedly in military custody in north Sudan after he was ousted in a coup in 2019.",

    "body": "8 hours agoThomas NaadiandNicolas NégoceEleven Nigerian military officers were briefly detained in Burkina Faso after their aircraft made an emergency landing in the country, Burkinabè security sources told the BBC.The Air Force C-130 aircraft entered Burkina Faso's airspace on Monday without authorisation, according to the country's Territorial Administration Minister Emile Zerbo. In a joint statement, the military governments of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger said their prompt investigation confirmed the \"violation of its airspace and the sovereignty of its member states\". But the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) said a technical problem meant the plane, which was en route to Portugal, had to land in accordance with safety procedures. The statement added that the crew was \"safe and have received cordial treatment from the host authorities\". It did not mention whether they had been detained.The aircraft landed in Bobo-Dioulasso, in the west of Burkina Faso and its second-largest city. The NAF said it was the site of the nearest airfield when the plane had to make an emergency stop.But the Nigerian account of the incident contradicts the position of the trio of Sahel countries, formally known as Alliance of Sahel States (AES), which said that the aircraft entered Burkinabè airspace without prior authorisation and was forced to land.\"An investigation was immediately opened by the competent Burkinabè services and highlighted the lack of authorisation to fly over Burkinabè territory for this military apparatus,\" the AES said in a joint statement. It called the landing an \"unfriendly act\" and said the countries' respective air forces had been put on maximum alert and authorised to \"neutralise any aircraft\" found to violate the confederation's airspace.On board were two crew members and nine passengers, all military officers, according to the AES.  The Burkinabè authorities told BBC that the soldiers were released and given permission to fly back to Nigeria. In its statement, the NAF said that plans were under way to resume the mission to Portugal as scheduled, assuring the public that the air force remained committed to operational aviation  procedures and safety standards. Political analysts have linked the incident to the deployment of troops from West Africa's regional bloc, Ecowas, to Benin following an attempted coup on Sunday.Nigeria led the regional mission with the deployment of jets and troops to suppress the mutiny in Benin. Earlier this year, all the three military-led countries - Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger - withdrew from Ecowas, citing a mix of political and security grievances.They had rejected Ecowas' demands for them to restore democratic rule.The three Sahel countries have also distanced themselves from Western countries, notably from former colonial ruler France, while drawing closer to Russia.",

But I thought that over the course of a year he had gained some introspection,\" she said.</p><p>Turning to Dogan, she added: \"You don't understand that this was rape. When will you admit that it's a crime? I am ashamed for you.\"</p><p>She also addressed the devastation that had engulfed her family since the trial. </p><p>Her daughter, Caroline Darian, maintains she too was drugged and abused by her father after photos showing her unconscious were found on Pelicot's computer. </p><p>Ms Darian has since spoken about feeling unsupported by her mother. The two are reportedly no longer in contact and Ms Darian was not in court with Gisèle this week.</p><p>\"My family is trying to rebuild itself however it can,\" Gisèle said. \"I hope [Caroline] finds the answers she is looking for. I hope one day we can find each other again.\"</p><p>She also asked to stop being referred to as an icon. \"I am an ordinary woman who dared to open up her trial,\" she said. \"I have become an icon against my will.\"</p><p>As in the original trial, Gisèle ended her statement with a thought for other victims of rape – the majority of whom did not have the wealth of evidence that she had to bring her abusers to court.</p><p>\"I want to say to them to never be ashamed of what was inflicted upon us, because it is not their fault,\" she said.</p></div></article>",

The Brooklyn Nets are owned by the company's chair, Joseph Tsai.</p></div><div><p>It is the first time an NBA fixture has been played in Macau - a special administrative region like Hong Kong, known for its casinos - since 2007.</p><p>The NBA has cast the games as part of efforts to tap into a burgeoning viewership of American basketball in the country, with commissioner Adam Silver telling news agency AFP that there was \"tremendous interest in the NBA throughout China\".</p><p>Analysis by US sports broadcaster ESPN in 2022 suggested the value of NBA China, the arm that manages its operations in the country, was estimated at approximately $5bn (£3.7bn).</p><p>Basketball's popularity in the east Asian nation skyrocketed when Chinese player Yao Ming was drafted by the Houston Rockets in 2002.</p><p>The NBA estimated in 2019 that 300 million people in China played the sport.</p><p>The games could be interpreted as the culmination of a slow but steady reconciliation between the NBA and China, on a backdrop of tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade.</p><p>China suspended NBA broadcasts on Chinese TV channels and streaming platforms after the NBA refused to apologise or discipline then-manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, who posted on social media: \"Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\"</p><p>At the time, the city was engulfed in regular protests over the erosion of free speech and assembly rights, which culminated in China passing a security law to crack down on dissent. Beijing maintains this was necessary to maintain order.</p><p>Mr Morey backpedalled after a backlash from Chinese fans, while the NBA said it was \"regrettable\" that fans in China were upset and acknowledged he had \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China\".</p><p>Since then, NBA games have gradually returned to Chinese TV channels.</p><p>Chinese fans have expressed their excitement about the upcoming games.</p><p>\"We'd been preparing and planning for this two months in advance,\" Lyu Yizhe, from Xiamen, told Reuters in Macau. \"It feels extra special because we're long-time NBA fans - we've been watching since 1998, back in the Michael Jordan and Chicago Bulls era.\"</p><p>Mole Zeng, who travelled from Hangzhou, told the news agency: \"I believe that in the future, as the NBA continues to grow in China, more and more star players will come here to meet us in person.\"</p></div>",

EU parliament votes to ban meat names for plant-based foods</h2><p></p><div><div><p>2 days ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Danai Nesta Kupemba</span><span>BBC News</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The European Parliament (EP) has voted to ban the use of words like \"burger\" or \"steak\" to describe their plant-based variants.</p><p>The 355-247 majority vote is seen as a victory for livestock farmers who say the labels threaten their industry and livelihoods. </p><p>A full ban, however, is not imminent - or even certain - as the proposal needs the backing of the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - as well as the governments of the 27 member countries to become law. </p><p>The plant-based food industry has grown exponentially in recent years, with more people opting for a meat-free lifestyle.</p></div><div><p>\"Let's call a spade a spade,\" Celine Imart, the French member of the parliament who led the initiative was quoted by AFP news agency as saying about plant-based products. </p><p>Marketing plant-based products using meat labels \"is misleading for the consumer\", the member of the conservative EPP group in the EP said. </p><p>Under the proposal, other labels like, \"egg yolk\", \"egg white\" and \"escalope\" would be restricted to products that contain meat. </p><p>The EU has already defined dairy items as products coming from the \"normal mammary secretion\". This includes products like milk, yogurt and cheese. </p><p>Oat milk, for instance, is called an oat drink on European shelves.</p><p>Greens and liberal lawmakers have criticised the now-approved EP text as \"useless\". </p><p>\"While the world is burning, the EPP has nothing better to do this week than to involve us all in a debate about sausages and schnitzel,\"  Anna Cavazzini of Germany's Green Party was quoted by Deutsche Welle as saying. </p><p>Environmentalists have said that the ban would be a setback for sustainability. </p><p>The proposal has also drawn criticism from key food industry voices in Germany - the largest market for plant-based products  in the EU, according to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gfieurope.org/european-plant-based-sales-data/#spain\">report by the Good Food Institute of Europe. </a></p><p>Major German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, fast food joint Burger King and sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1or1KNtCSQrP1zFD4-3xAQAWR8Tbwi0OA/view\">have pushed back against the proposal in a joint open letter</a>. </p><p>They said banning \"familiar terms\" would make it \"more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions\". </p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz - whose party is a key member of the EPP - fully backs the ban. \"A sausage is a sausage. Sausage is not vegan,\" he said recently.</p><p>The French meat industry has also strongly supported the idea. </p><p>Back in 2020, a similar proposal was on the table but it wasn't passed.</p></div>",

There is no war against smuggling; there is a war for oil and it must be stopped by the world. The aggression is against all of Latin America and the Caribbean.\"</p><p>Petro did not provide further details about the alleged identities of those on board. The US has not commented on the identities of the individuals killed in the strikes.</p><p>The White House said in a statement that it \"looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement\". </p><p>It said that while the two nations had \"policy differences\", the US remained \"committed to close co-operation on a range of shared priorities, including regional security and stability\". </p><p>Speaking on Thursday at the EU Global Gateway Forum in Brussels, Petro said he had asked for all Caribbean foreign ministers to meet over the strikes. </p><p>The US says its strikes, which began on 2 September, had targeted vessels off the coast of Venezuela that it alleges were carrying illegal drugs. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o\">First US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': Was it legal?</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c78nl9lz8zeo\">What is Trump's goal after bombing 'Venezuela drugs boat'?</a></li></ul><p>The measure considered by the Senate on Wednesday, which would have required Trump to seek congressional approval for the strikes, was rejected in a 48-51 vote.</p><p>It had been introduced by Democratic Senators Schiff and Tim Kaine.

    "body": "<div><p>French President Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister within 48 hours, the Elysee Palace has said, fending off speculation that fresh elections could be imminent.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, outgoing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu said the possibility of dissolving parliament was beginning to fade following talks with political parties over the last two days.</p><p>\"There is a majority in parliament and that is the majority that is keen to avoid fresh elections,\" he said.</p><p>On Monday, Lecornu - a close ally of Macron - became the third French PM to leave his job in less than a year, driven out by a hung parliament deeply divided along ideological lines.</p></div><div><p>He was then asked by Macron to stay on for two days to form a consensus among parties on how to get out of the current political crisis.</p><p>In a much-awaited TV interview on Wednesday evening, Lecornu gave no indication about who the next prime minister would be, and although he said his mission was \"finished\", he also did not appear to rule himself out entirely.</p><p>He said that as well as not wanting fresh elections, most MPs also recognised the pressing need to pass a budget by the end of the year.</p><p>However, he recognised the path towards forming a government was still complicated due to the divisions within parliament and to politicians eyeing the next presidential election.</p><p>Whoever ends up in government \"will need to be completely disconnected from any presidential ambition for 2027,\" said Lecornu, a former armed forces minister.</p><p>France's political stalemate began following snap elections in July 2024. Since then no one party has had a majority, making it difficult to pass any laws or reforms including the yearly budget.</p><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt, which this year stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.</p><p>Previous prime ministers Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou were ousted in confidence votes after they presented austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu said his own draft budget would be presented next week, although it would be \"open for debate\".</p><p>\"But the debate needs to begin... parties cannot say they'll vote it down without examining it,\" he added.</p><p>Similarly, Lecornu said, one big issue that has been plaguing French politics since 2023 will need to be revisited - Macron's highly contested pension reforms. \"We have to find a way for the debate to take place,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>But some factions in parliament appear immovable from their positions.</p><p>Mathilde Panot of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) said soon after Lecornu's TV interview that the only solution was \"the resignation and departure of Emmanuel Macron\".</p><p>Meanwhile, far right National Rally's leader Marine Le Pen, who has long been calling for fresh elections, stated on Wednesday that she would vote down any new government.</p><p>It is unclear, at this stage, which political forces would support a new government.</p><p>The so-called common platform of centrists and Republicans that have run the government since last year appears to have fallen apart.</p><p>The big question now is whether over the last 48 hours Lecornu was able to persuade the Socialists, who were part of that left bloc during the elections, to prop up a government in some way.</p><p>Asked about the calls by some political factions for Macron to resign, with even Macron's own former prime minister Edouard Philippe floating the idea earlier this week, Lecornu said France needed a stable, internationally recognised figure at its helm.</p><p>\"This is not the time to change the president,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>However, Macron is appearing increasingly isolated, with even close allies beginning to distance themselves from him.</p><p>Earlier this week Gabriel Attal, widely seen as Macron's protégé, said he \"no longer understood\" Macron and called for the appointment of an independent negotiator to steer the government.</p><p>Macron has not yet spoken publicly since Lecornu's shock resignation on Monday morning. Lecornu promised the president would \"address the French people in due course,\" without specifying when that may be.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges by a grand jury. </p><p>James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. </p><p>Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. </p><p>In a statement, James accused the president - who recently publicly pressured prosecutors to file criminal charges against her - of a \"desperate weaponization of our justice system\".</p></div><div><p>\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general,\" she said. </p><p>\"These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.\"</p><p>The US prosecutor assigned to the case, Lindsey Halligan, meanwhile, said the case proved that \"no one is above the law\". </p><p>\"The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" she said. </p><p>\"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump's only goal is \"political retribution\" - Letitia James responds to indictment</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Trump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.</p><p>James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.</p><p>The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home. </p><p>The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead \"used as a rental investment property\", which was being rented to a family of three.</p><p>The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.</p><p>Halligan said that, if convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison per count and up to a $1 million (£751,755) fine on each count.</p><p>James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said: \"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"</p><p>Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. </p><p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.</p><p>James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress.</p><p>The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.</p><p>In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. </p><p>During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a \"political witch hunt\" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law\". </p><p>James on Thursday said she stands behind her office's litigation against Trump and his organisation. </p><p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said James's indictment \"is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable.\"</p><p>The New York Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union called it \"the latest in a long list of brazen abuses of power by President Trump\".</p></div>",

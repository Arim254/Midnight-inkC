This is when his charges will be formally read out to him in court. </p><p>Mr Comey is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy50ggv35zpo\">accused of lying to a Senate committee in 2020</a> about whether he authorised a leak to the media of classified information. </p><p>He led the FBI during a tumultuous time, when the bureau was investigating two high-profile matters: pro-Trump election interference by Russia in 2016 and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. </p><p>He has denied the criminal allegations and said he has \"great confidence in the federal judicial system\". </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3e48/live/fdf57990-a164-11f0-9e4f-7326464dc86f.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3e48/live/fdf57990-a164-11f0-9e4f-7326464dc86f.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3e48/live/fdf57990-a164-11f0-9e4f-7326464dc86f.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3e48/live/fdf57990-a164-11f0-9e4f-7326464dc86f.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3e48/live/fdf57990-a164-11f0-9e4f-7326464dc86f.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3e48/live/fdf57990-a164-11f0-9e4f-7326464dc86f.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3e48/live/fdf57990-a164-11f0-9e4f-7326464dc86f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3e48/live/fdf57990-a164-11f0-9e4f-7326464dc86f.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images James Comey walking through a hallway where reporters are gathered \" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><div><p>If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison.</p><p>Trump fired Mr Comey early into his first term in office in 2017 as the FBI was investigating Russian interference, a probe that later found the Trump campaign did not co-ordinate with the Kremlin in the election.

The two already sit in the same European Parliament group – the \"pro-sovereignty\" Patriots for Europe, which Babis founded alongside Hungary's Viktor Orban and Austria's Herbert Kickl last year.</p><p>ANO shares the Motorists' misgivings about the EU's emissions targets, and vows to modify or reject them outright.</p><p>Both parties are firmly against Czech households carrying a greater financial burden for cleaner energy, and both oppose the EU's ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars after 2035.</p><p>Relations with the SPD could be more fraught.</p><p>For a start, SPD fought this election in a formal alliance with a number of fringe parties on the far-right, meaning they will have to yield some of their seats to them. Okamura may not have full control of the MPs in his caucus – always a recipe for disaster in coalition politics.</p><p>Babis has also categorically ruled out allowing a referendum on either EU or NATO membership – a key policy priority for the SPD.</p><p>The ANO leader might have leaned heavily into anti-Ukrainian rhetoric in the final days of the campaign, lambasting the centre-right government for giving \"Czech mothers nothing, and Ukrainians everything\".</p><p>But Okamura's call for Ukrainian refugees to be deported en masse will likely fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Czech military support for Ukraine's war effort however is likely to change significantly under a Babis administration.</p></div><div><p>He has already vowed to scrap the successful Czech ammunition initiative – which has delivered 3.5 million shells to Ukraine since 2022.</p><p>Babis claims it lacks transparency, but Czech government officials who created the scheme say it works precisely because it is not transparent.</p><p>Under the initiative, Czech arms dealers use their international contacts to procure shells for Ukraine on the global market, with the bulk of the money coming from EU and NATO partners. Some of the producers are in countries that have relationships with Russia but as the deal is arranged with Czech dealers their involvement remains private.</p><p>The ANO leader wants it moved under the umbrella of NATO instead, and again on Saturday accused Czech arms dealers of making enormous profits from the scheme.</p><p>However, he said he would have no problem negotiating the matter with President Zelensky.</p><p>Babis also laughed off claims Western allies were worried the Czech Republic would no longer be a reliable partner in the EU and NATO under his administration, and that was why he now appeared to be distancing himself from extremist parties.</p><p>\"Your problem is you just copy lies from Czech journalists,\" he replied, answering a reporter from the New York Times in English.</p><p>\"I spoke with Trump five times! I was in the Pentagon. I was in the FBI. I talked to the head of the CIA,\" Babis said, speaking of his first term, which overlapped with President Trump's first term in office.</p><p>\"We were a very reliable partner,\" he went on.</p><p>\"I have been prime minister. We have been in government before. And we had excellent results.\"</p></div></article>",

On Friday, four Italian activists were deported.</p><p>Israeli authorities arrested about 470 people as dozens of vessels from the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) were stopped by Israeli forces from reaching Gaza.</p><p>The GSF called the interceptions illegal, while Israel described the flotilla's actions as a \"publicity stunt\". The blocking of the flotilla sparked protests around the world.</p></div><div><p>In a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/IsraelMFA/status/1974450494492864807\">post on X</a> on Saturday, the Israeli foreign ministry said 137 \"provocateurs\" had been deported to Turkey.</p><p>Those expelled are citizens of the UK, US, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Algeria, Mauritania, Malaysia, Bahrain, Morocco, Switzerland, Tunisia, and Turkey, the ministry said.</p><p>The first boats were stopped on Wednesday in international waters about 70 nautical miles (130km) off Gaza. Israel has been policing this area but does not have jurisdiction there.</p><p>Grainy night-time footage livestreamed from some of the boats showed them sailing towards Gaza.</p><p>Israel said its navy told the boats to change course as they were \"approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade\".</p><p>On Friday, the Israeli foreign ministry said: \"Already four Italian citizens have been deported. The rest are in the process of being deported. Israel is keen to end this procedure as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>It added that all detainees were in good health. The GSF has alleged that many activists were assaulted with water cannon while their boats were intercepted. </p><p>The foreign ministry's initial statement mentioned the presence of Swedish activist Greta Thunberg on one of the boats, but did not give further details on her status.</p><p>In a statement on Friday, the GSF said: \"Over 38 hours, Israeli occupation naval forces illegally intercepted all 42 of our vessels - each carrying humanitarian aid, volunteers, and the determination to break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza.\" </p><p>It said the last of its boats, the Marinette, was intercepted at 10:29 local time on Friday, approximately 42.5 nautical miles from Gaza in international waters.</p><p>\"This is an illegal attack on unarmed humanitarians. We call on governments and international institutions to demand their immediate safety and release,\" it added.</p><p>Five of the vessels intercepted on Thursday are now moored at the Israeli Ashdod Naval Base, tracking website Marine Traffic showed on Friday.</p><p>The BBC has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) whether it plans to return the vessels to their owners and how long those detained will be held.</p><p>The GSF flotilla set sail for Gaza from Spain at the end of last month, with other boats joining from Tunisia and other ports later, the GSF said. </p><p>Protests in support of the flotilla and against the war in Gaza ramped up around the world as the boats neared the Strip, in countries including Spain, Italy, Colombia and Argentina.</p><p><i>Additional reporting by Matt Murphy and Richard Irvine-Brown</i></p></div>",

Leavitt said that most of those cuts would come from agencies that \"do not align with this administration's values of putting our country first\". </p><p>As part of the federal government's response to the shut down, Vought on Friday announced the suspension of $2.1bn in federal infrastructure funding for Chicago, in addition to the previous freezing of $18bn in infrastructure spending in New York City and the cancellation of approximately $8bn in funding for federal energy projects in some Democratic-run states. </p><p>On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democrats are fighting the healthcare issue because \"we know Americans want this\". </p><p>\"And we know many of my Republican colleagues want this as well,\" he said. \"But failure to act would be devastating, and Republicans know it.\" </p><p>Some Democrats - including Connecticut Senator Richard Bluementhal and Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman - said they want to hear directly from the president about the ongoing stalemate. </p><p>Citing a bipartisan border bill that the president ultimately rejected last year, they said they fear that any negotiations with Senate Republicans could ultimately be contradicted by Trump. </p><p>Early polls have suggested that Americans are deeply split on the shutdown, with one Washington Post poll conducted on 1 October finding that 47% of US adults blame Republicans, compared to 30% who blame Democrats. </p><p>Another 23% said they were unsure.</p><p><i>(With additional reporting from Cai Pigliucci on Capitol Hill)</i></p></div>",

Officials said an \"armed woman\" was shot after claiming she and others rammed their cars into law enforcement vehicles.</p><p>State and local leaders have for weeks criticised Trump's deployment plans and called it an abuse of power. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said Trump was \"attempting to manufacture a crisis\".</p><p>The announcement came as a federal judge in Portland, Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying 200 troops there.</p></div><div><p>Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: \"Agents were unable to move their vehicles and exited the car. One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon.\"</p><p>\"Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen,\" she added.</p><p>Judge Karin Immergut called Trump's statements about conditions in Portland \"untethered to the facts,\" and said the move violated the Constitution. </p><p>She said the use of the military to quell unrest without the state of Oregon consenting risked the sovereignty of that state and others, adding that it also inflamed tensions in the city and caused increased protests.<b> </b></p><p>Immergut ruled that the administration's arguments for the deployment \"risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power - to the detriment of this nation\". </p><p>Oregon Governor Tina Kotek applauded the court's decision and said she hopes Trump respects the order and halts the deployment. </p><p>\"There is no insurrection in Portland, no threat to national security,\" she said in a statement. \"The only threat we face is to our Democracy - and that threat is being led by President Trump.\" </p><p>The Trump administration has filed a notice indicating it will appeal the judge's decision. The president on Saturday again criticised leadership in the state and said they were taking a look at the order. </p><p>\"The place is burning down, and they pretend like there's nothing happening,\" Trump told reporters. </p><p>Meanwhile, California's governor Gavin Newsom said Trump had ordered 300 National Guard troops in California to deploy to Oregon after the judge's order. Newsom said he plans to file a lawsuit over the move. </p><p>In Chicago, it's still unclear whether any troops have arrived - though any such deployment would likely be met with legal challenges.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c0dd/live/4ac49720-a187-11f0-b1c5-b56e9bf8a857.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c0dd/live/4ac49720-a187-11f0-b1c5-b56e9bf8a857.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c0dd/live/4ac49720-a187-11f0-b1c5-b56e9bf8a857.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c0dd/live/4ac49720-a187-11f0-b1c5-b56e9bf8a857.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c0dd/live/4ac49720-a187-11f0-b1c5-b56e9bf8a857.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c0dd/live/4ac49720-a187-11f0-b1c5-b56e9bf8a857.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c0dd/live/4ac49720-a187-11f0-b1c5-b56e9bf8a857.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c0dd/live/4ac49720-a187-11f0-b1c5-b56e9bf8a857.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Federal immigration authorities stand guarding a federal facility amid ongoing protests in Chicago \" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>It's unclear whether any troops have yet been mobilised after Trump's authorisation</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>The city is the latest - many of them led by Democrats - to be targeted for a controversial deployment of troops, joining Washington, Los Angeles, Memphis and Portland.</p><p>The deployments have posed both legal and constitutional questions, as National Guard troops are typically deployed by a state's governor and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ylyd9lkkqo\">century-old laws limit the government's use of the military</a> for domestic matters.<b> </b></p><p>Chicago has seen an increase in protests over immigration enforcement in the city, many of them happening outside US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. </p><p>\"Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like [Gov] Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has authorized 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. \"President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.\"</p><p>On Saturday - just before Trump authorised troops there - US Border Patrol personnel shot a woman in Chicago after a group of people rammed cars into immigration enforcement vehicles, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement.

They want to create the war zone so that they can send in even more troops,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"They're using every lever at their disposal to keep us from maintaining order.\"</p></div><div><p>Earlier this week, the president talked about his ongoing military deployments to US cities while addressing high-ranking leaders across the military. </p><p>He told military leaders he wants American cities used as \"training grounds\" for US troops so they can combat the \"enemy from within\" and quell unrest. </p><p>\"They're very unsafe places and we're going to straighten them out one by one,\" he said of Democratic-led cities, including Chicago. He told the military leaders it would be \"a major part for some of the people in this room\".</p><p>Trump has threatened to send troops to Chicago for nearly a month - citing crime and shootings in the city. </p><p>Violent crime in Chicago has fallen significantly over the past two years. Between January and June, the homicide rate was down by a third compared with the same period last year, according to the Council on Criminal Justice.</p><p>But the overall levels in Chicago remain substantially higher than the average for many US cities.

Last week, assistant health minister Penioni Ravunawa warned Fiji may record more than 3,000 new HIV cases by the end of 2025.</p><p>\"This is a national crisis,\" he said. \"And it is not slowing down.\"</p><p>The BBC spoke to multiple experts, advocates and frontline workers about the reasons for such a meteoric rise in case numbers. Several pointed out that, as awareness around HIV spreads and stigma diminishes, more people have been coming forward and getting tested.</p><p>At the same time though, they also noted that countless more remain invisible to the official figures – and that the true scale of the issue is likely much bigger than even the record-breaking numbers suggest.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Sharing the blood'</h2><p></p><div><p>Underpinning Fiji's HIV epidemic is a spiralling trend of drug use, unsafe sex, needle sharing and \"bluetoothing\". </p><p>Otherwise known as \"hotspotting\", this latter term refers to a practice where an intravenous drug user withdraws their blood after a hit and injects it into a second person – who may then do the same for a third, and so on.</p><p>Kalesi Volatabu, executive director for the NGO Drug Free Fiji, has seen it happen firsthand. Last May, she was on one of her regular early morning walks through the Fijian capital of Suva, offering support and education to drug users on the streets, when she turned a corner and saw a group of seven or eight people huddling together.</p><p>\"I saw the needle with the blood – it was right there in front of me,\" she recalls. \"This young woman, she'd already had the shot and she's taking out the blood – and then you've got other girls, other adults, already lining up to be hit with this thing.</p><p>\"It's not just needles they're sharing – they're sharing the blood.\"</p><p>Bluetoothing has also been reported in South Africa and Lesotho, two countries with some of the world's highest rates of HIV. In Fiji, the practice became popular within the past few years, according to both Ms Volatabu and Ms Naitala.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Supplied: Kalesi Volatabu A woman in a black and turquoise dress, wearing glasses and speaking into a microphone in front of several onlookers.

Another is the convenience of only needing one syringe.</p><p>These can be difficult to come by in Fiji, where pharmacies, under police pressure, often demand prescriptions for syringes, and there is a lack of needle-syringe programmes. </p><p>Although there is growing acceptance and approval for the rollout of such programmes – which provide clean injecting equipment to drug users in an attempt to reduce the transmission of blood-borne infections like HIV – implementation in the highly religious and conservative country has proven challenging.</p><p>Ms Volatabu says there is a \"drastic shortage\" of needle-syringe sites, which is fuelling dangerous practices like needle-sharing and bluetoothing and putting the onus on NGOs to distribute syringes as well as condoms.</p><p>In August 2024, Fiji's Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MOH) recognised bluetoothing as one of the drivers for the country's rise in HIV cases. Another was chemsex, where people use drugs - often methamphetamine - before and during sexual encounters. </p><p>In Fiji, unlike most other countries around the world, crystal meth is predominantly consumed via intravenous injection.</p><p>MOH also found that of the 1,093 new cases recorded in the first nine months of 2024, 223 – about 20% – were from intravenous drug use.</p></div><p></p><h2>Kids on meth</h2><p></p><div><p>Fiji has become a major Pacific trafficking hub for crystal meth over the past 15 years. A large part of this is due to the country's geographic location between East Asia and the Americas – some of the world's biggest manufacturers of the drug - and Australia and New Zealand – the world's highest-paying markets.</p><p>During that same period, meth has spilled into and spread throughout local communities, developing into a crisis that, like HIV, was recently declared a \"national emergency\". </p><p>And according to those on the frontlines, the age of users is trending downwards.</p><p>\"We see more and more of these young people,\" says Ms Volatabu. \"They are getting younger and younger.\"</p><p>Fiji's most recent national HIV statistics cite injectable drug use as the most common known mode of transmission, accounting for 48% of cases. Sexual transmission accounted for 47% of cases, while mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy and childbirth was cited as the cause of most paediatric cases.</p><p>Everyone the BBC spoke to agreed that lack of education is a central factor in the epidemic. Ms Volatabu and Ms Naitala are both working to change that – and Ms Naitala says that as a greater awareness around the dangers of HIV spreads throughout the community, \"bluetoothing\" has, in her experience, fallen out of favour.</p><p>More people are getting tested and seeking treatment for HIV, leading to more robust data around the scale of the crisis.</p><p>But there is still a worry that the official case numbers are merely the tip of the iceberg – and a fear of what may lie beneath the surface.</p></div><p></p><h2>The avalanche</h2><p></p><div><p>José Sousa-Santos, head of the Pacific Regional Security Hub at New Zealand's University of Canterbury, says \"a perfect storm is brewing\".</p><p>\"The concern is across all levels of society and government in regards to Fiji's HIV crisis – not just what's happening at the moment, but where it's going to be in three years' time and the lack of Fiji's resources,\" he tells the BBC. \"The support systems - the nursing, the ability to distribute or to access the drugs for treatment of HIV - just aren't there.</p><p>\"That's what terrifies us, the people that work in the region: there is no way that Fiji can deal with this.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Supplied: José Sousa-Santos A man with a goatee wearing a blue suit and blue shirt\" /><span>Supplied: José Sousa-Santos</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>José Sousa-Santos has been ringing the alarm bell on Fiji's HIV epidemic for years</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Following its declaration of an outbreak in January, the Fijian government has sought to improve its HIV surveillance and enhance its ability to address the likely underreporting of cases.</p><p>The Global Alert and Response Network, which was called upon to provide that support, stated in a recent report that \"addressing these pressing issues through a well-coordinated national response is crucial in reversing the trajectory of the HIV epidemic in Fiji\".</p><p>That report also noted that staffing shortages, communication issues, challenges with lab equipment and stockouts of HIV rapid tests and medicines were impacting screening, diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>Data collection is slow, difficult and error-prone, it added – hampering efforts to understand the extent of Fiji's HIV epidemic and the efficacy of the outbreak response.</p><p>That leaves many experts, authorities and everyday Fijians in the dark.

    "body": "<div><div><p>3 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Rushdi Abualouf</span><span>Gaza correspondent</span><span> and</span></p><p><span>Mallory Moench</span><span></span></p></span></p></div><div><p>President Donald Trump has said he thinks the hostages held in Gaza will start to be freed \"very soon\" as mediators are set to meet in Egypt on Monday for indirect peace talks between Hamas and Israel.</p><p>The talks come after Hamas agreed to some parts of a 20-point US peace plan, including releasing hostages and handing over Gaza governance to Palestinian technocrats, but is seeking negotiations on other issues. </p><p>The group's response did not mention the key demands of its disarmament and playing no future role in Gaza's governance.</p><p>When asked about flexibility, Trump told reporters \"we don't need flexibility because everybody has pretty much agreed to it, but there will always be some changes\".</p></div><div><p>Trump added that he had heard negotiations were \"going very well\".</p><p>\"It's a great deal for Israel, it's a great deal for the entire Arab world, Muslim world, and world, so we're very happy about it.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes continued in Gaza, despite Trump telling Israel to \"immediately stop the bombing\" on Friday after Hamas responded to the proposed plan.</p><p>Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told reporters on Sunday that \"while certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there's no ceasefire in place at this point in time\".</p><p>Bedrosian said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had given orders \"to fire back for defensive purposes... if there is a threat to their life in the battlefield in Gaza\".</p><p>Reports from Gaza say Israel continued air strikes and tank fire overnight and into Sunday, destroying a number of residential buildings in Gaza City.</p><p>A BBC correspondent heard explosions from inside Gaza and saw a plume of smoke while near the border in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on Sunday morning.</p><p>Another 65 people were killed by Israeli military operations in the 24 hours leading up to midday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said.</p></div><div><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the BBC's US news partner CBS News that bombing needs to stop to facilitate a hostage release.</p><p>\"You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on... that has to stop, but you also have to work through the other logistics,\" he told CBS News' Face the Nation on Sunday.</p><p>\"We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible,\" he added.</p><p>The 20-point plan proposes an immediate end to fighting and the release of 48 hostages, only 20 of whom are thought to be alive, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans.</p><p>Netanyahu said in a televised address on Saturday that he hoped to announce the release of hostages \"in the coming days\".</p><p>The prime minister has \"made it clear that in an agreement with the Trump administration talks will be confined to a few days maximum\", Bedrosian said.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c70155nked7o\">Read the full 20-point peace plan</a></li></ul><p>Netanyahu ordered the departure of the Israeli delegation on Monday for the crucial talks.</p><p>A Hamas delegation headed by chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ced58zywdwno\">one of the targets of an Israeli assassination attempt</a> in Doha, Qatar last month, was due to arrive in Cairo on Sunday night.</p><p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will also attend.</p><p>The talks are expected to be among the most consequential since the start of the war and could determine whether a path toward ending the conflict is finally within reach.</p><p>Many Palestinians described Hamas' response to the peace plan as unexpected, after days of indications that the group was preparing to reject or at least heavily condition its acceptance of Trump's peace plan proposal.</p><p>Instead, Hamas refrained from including its traditional \"red lines\" in the official statement, a move many interpret as a sign of external pressure.</p><p>A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish mediators played a major role in convincing Hamas to tone down its objections and to leave contentious points such as the fate of its weapons, Gaza's post-war governance and its other concerns for the negotiation table.</p><p>Many Gazans warn that this tactical flexibility carries considerable risk.</p><p>Every additional day of delay means more deaths, destruction, and displacement for hundreds of thousands of Gazans.</p><p>Yet Hamas' decision to enter the talks without explicit preconditions could also be seen as a recognition of its limited leverage after nearly two years of war.</p><p>Trump, when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper what would happen if Hamas insists on staying in power in Gaza, responded in a text message that the group would face \"complete obliteration\".</p><p>The US president posted on social media that Israel had agreed to an initial withdrawal line in Gaza, the first in a proposed series of pull-backs by Israeli forces.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c5ykwny8dp9o\">BBC Verify: Unpicking Trump's Gaza peace plan map </a></li></ul><p>According to population distribution data in the Gaza Strip, the withdrawal map published by Trump would initially exclude nearly 900,000 Palestinians from returning to their homes.</p><p>The proposed lines carve out Rafah at the southernmost edge, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia in the north, nearly a quarter of Gaza City, and half of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah in the centre and south.</p><p>Hamas had rejected a similar map during previous rounds of talks in March and May this year.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>Since then, 67,139 have been killed by Israeli military operations in Gaza, the health ministry says.</p><p>International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war, making verifying claims from both sides difficult.</p><p>For now, the region holds its breath as negotiators prepare to gather in Egypt, hoping that despite deep mistrust and political fragility this round might finally open the way toward a ceasefire.</p></div>",

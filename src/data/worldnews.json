    "body": "2 days agoPaul Adams,Diplomatic CorrespondentandKayleen Devlin,BBC VerifyBBCOn 26 January, staff in an office in Mumbai received an urgent e-mail from a crew member aboard a tanker off the coast of Singapore.The email, purportedly written on behalf of five colleagues aboard the tanker sailing under the name Beeta, contained a litany of complaints: crew members, it was alleged, had not been paid and were being treated \"like animals\"; and provisions were running low.The staff in Mumbai worked for the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), the world's leading organisation representing seafarers, and were used to dealing with complaints from all corners of the globe.But what caught their eye was the fact that the emails hadn't just been copied to multiple ITF offices, but also to sanctions enforcement bodies in several countries.\"The vessel is sanctioned and blacklisted,\" the sailor wrote.He said he had discovered that the vessel calling itself the Beeta was in fact an American-sanctioned tanker called the Gale.The sailor and his colleagues were desperate to leave.\"I've been at sea for many years,\" he told the BBC when we contacted him. \"I know what's right and wrong.\"Inadvertently, the crew member had found himself involved in a problem at the heart of some of today's most contentious geopolitical issues: a surging number of tankers, transporting Russian and Iranian oil, operating outside maritime rules, using a variety of methods to conceal their identities.This \"shadow fleet\", as it's known, is growing fast.ITFThis image shows the American sanctioned tanker called the GaleEstimates vary, but the latest data from the monitoring group TankerTrackers.com says the fleet currently consists of 1,468 vessels, roughly triple its size at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago.That's about 18-19% of the total internationally trading tanker fleet, carrying approximately 17% of all seaborne crude, says Michelle Wiese Bockman, senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI.The phenomenon that first emerged in the 2010s, as North Korea and Iran sought to evade international sanctions, has proliferated, leaving western governments scrambling to keep up.So what can those governments do when countries circumvent or flout the rules to export oil and use the profits to fuel engines of war or repression?'Modern-day slavery'Definitions vary - as do names: it's also been called the \"dark\" or \"ghost\" fleet - but shadow vessels generally exhibit some or all of a particular set of characteristics.They tend to be old, averaging an age of around 20 years, and are often poorly maintained. Details of ownership and management are deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are frequently changed. Insurance is below Western standards and sometimes fake.Vessels frequently switch off or manipulate their automatic identification system (AIS), making them harder to track.Seamen, recruited on contracts that typically last six to nine months, don't always know what they're getting into.\"I didn't understand what shadow fleet vessels actually were,\" Russian engineer Denis told us, after serving aboard an EU- and UK-sanctioned tanker, Serena, for several months last year.Serena is currently flying under the flag of Cameroon. While Denis was aboard, it was flying a false Gambian flag.Denis says he realised the Serena was under sanctions only when he went aboard. But like many seamen, he says he needed the work.\"Once they're at sea, they've got them prisoner on board,\" says Nathan Smith, an ITF inspector familiar with the Serena.Smith has heard numerous stories of abuses aboard shadow vessels.\"It's a modern-day slavery,\" he says.Over the course of months spent sailing between Russia and China, the reality of life aboard a shadow vessel became increasingly apparent to Denis.\"Things began to deteriorate very quickly because no spare parts were sent,\" he said. \"The radar on the bridge hadn't been working for over a year, the life-saving equipment wasn't working and there were numerous faulty fire sensors.\"During a stop at the Russian port of Vladivostok, last October, the crew tried, without success, to repair a davit, a small specialised crane used to lower the tanker's life boats into the water. Denis says a port official nevertheless issued a certificate of successful inspection. The BBC has approached the Port of Vladivostok for comment.Denis says he never found out who owned the Serena or who crew members could contact to raise complaints.It's notoriously difficult to establish ownership of shadow fleet vessels. Ships have registered owners, which are often shell companies or entities set up to manage a single vessel. The names of real, or \"beneficial\" owners are frequently hidden. We have tried to make contact with the owners of the Gale and Serena, but without success. In the case of the Gale, it has proved impossible to establish the identity of the beneficial owner.Crews are poorly protected throughout the industry, with unpaid wages and abandonment by owners all-too frequent. But Denis says shadow vessels are the worst.\"Now I'll be more careful,\" he says. \"I've learned to identify dangerous vessels that I won't work on any more.\"The ships brought back from the deadDeep within the murky recesses of the shadow fleet also lurks a category experts have dubbed \"zombie ships\" - vessels which steal the identity of dead ships in order to hide their true identity.After being sanctioned, a zombie ship often disappears from tracking systems, later reappearing under a new name, using a stolen nine-digit International Maritime Organisation (IMO) number from a scrapped or decommissioned vessel.The ship's AIS tracking system, which uses transponders to continuously broadcast its location, is re-programmed to imitate the previous vessel.With the dead tanker's identity magically resurrected, the zombie ship continues to ply its trade, free from sanctions.The Gale is one such ship.According to the global trade intelligence company Kpler, the tanker, currently flying a false Gambian flag, has assumed multiple identities since being sanctioned by the US last year for its involvement in the export of sanctioned Iranian oil.After a period sailing under the false identity Sea Shell, using a different stolen IMO number, the Gale again changed identities, re-emerging as Beeta and loading a cargo of Iranian oil on 31 January.According to TankerTrackers.com, which uses satellite imagery, AIS data and shoreline photography to follow the movement of crude oil, the shipment was delivered by another US-sanctioned vessel via a ship-to-ship transfer, a procedure commonly used by shadow-fleet vessels involved in the shipment of sanctioned oil.Copernicus Sentinel 2, 2026Satellite imagery shows the Gale (Beeta) loading a cargo of Iranian oil in a ship-to-ship tranferThe ship-to-ship transfer took place south of the Riau Archipelago, around 150 miles east of Singapore.Windward AI's Michelle Wiese Bockmann calls the area \"an epicentre of maritime lawlessness\", where dozens of tankers gather to store or transfer Iranian oil.Bockmann says China imported 1.8 million barrels per day of sanctioned Iranian crude per day in 2025. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy for a response.\"None of it was traced,\" she says, \"because tankers hide their loading and the oil has come on four or five tankers, deliberately to obscure the origin and destination of the cargo.\"The Gale's history and behaviour mark it out as a classic zombie ship.A computer screenshot taken on board by the crew member who contacted the ITF appears to give instructions on how to fake the ship's location, a process known as spoofing.Two other screenshots, taken on 26 January, show the spoofing at work.One displays the tanker's actual location, east of Singapore. The second, taken just five minutes later, shows a fake location, around 2,800 miles away, off the coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.\"The confirmed linkage between Gale, Sea Shell, and Beeta, alongside fabricated AIS position history and prior impersonation, is consistent with deliberate identity manipulation,\" says Ana Subasic, an analyst at the global trade intelligence company Kpler.The BBC has no reason to believe the Serena is a zombie vessel, but the ship's former engineer says he saw equipment that would enable the Serena to fake its position.\"I spoke with the bridge officers about turning off the AIS and other manipulation,\" Denis told us. \"We had equipment on board to change the vessel's position. I think this equipment is only used for sanctioned cargo.\"What can be done?Such practices, coupled with the knowledge that Russian and Iranian oil revenues continue to fuel conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East, are driving an urgent debate in western capitals about how to respond.Donald Trump's recent actions in Venezuela – seizing seven tankers since early December as part of a pressure campaign on the regime of then president Nicolás Maduro – has shown that one solution is the simple application of force.The operation to chase and capture one vessel, the Russian-flagged tanker Marinera, took the US military, including a coastguard vessel and special forces, on a two-week chase far out into the North Atlantic.The Marinera, previously known as the Guyanese-flagged Bella 1, was wanted by the US for transporting sanctioned oil from both Venezuela and Iran.Getty ImagesBella 1, renamed Marinera, was intercepted in the early hours of 7 JanuaryThe change of name and flag was designed to provide the tanker with a measure of international protection.Upping the ante further, Russia took the highly unusual step of requesting that the US call off its pursuit and said it had dispatched a submarine to escort the tanker, which was empty at the time. The Russian Foreign Ministry said there was not \"any basis\" to allege the tanker was sailing \"without a flag\" or \"under a false flag\".Undeterred by the possibility of an international incident or by the possible accusation of piracy on the high seas, the US intercepted the Marinera in international waters between Iceland and the UK in the early hours of 7 January.Getty ImagesThe Russian-flagged Marinera - seen in January in Burghead, Scotland - was wanted by the US for transporting sanctioned oil from both Venezuela and IranFor the first time, the UK got involved, sending an RAF surveillance aircraft and a Royal Navy support ship to help the operation.Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was \"in full compliance with international law\" and said the UK was \"stepping up activity against shadow vessels\".Perhaps spurred on by Washington's assertive approach, there is some evidence that European partners are willing to take more robust action too.Two weeks after the Marinera episode, France launched an operation in the Mediterranean to seize the Grinch, another Russia-linked tanker suspected of violating international sanctions.ReutersA French navy boat stopping the Grinch oil tankerOnce again, the UK was involved. A Royal Navy patrol boat, HMS Dagger, shadowed the Grinch, as it passed through the Strait of Gibraltar.With at least one sanctioned vessel passing through the English Channel every day, according to experts, speculation is mounting that the UK might soon conduct its own interceptions.Healey recently told MPs that \"further military options\" were being explored.For some, it can't come soon enough.\"There's obviously huge frustration in the policy-maker circles in Brussels and London that Russia is continuing to sell its oil,\" says Tom Keatinge, founding director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) in London.Keatinge runs a maritime sanctions task force at Rusi, bringing together representatives from industry and government. Some participants, he sees, are keen to see more forthright action.\"We have people… who like jumping out of helicopters on ropes,\" he says. \"And that community has thus far been kept firmly in its box.\"He adds: \"Put bluntly, no one's had the balls to look at what is often a 50-50 call and say 'We'll send the boys in'.\" The MoD said: \"Deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government.\"But the constraints are considerable.\"You've got a bunch of consequences that you need to be ready to deal with,\" Keatinge says. \"The first is you've got an absolutely enormous vessel. What the hell do you do with that?\"Once seized, tankers need to be maintained, with engines running and a skeleton crew on board. The appetite for holding such vessels, particularly older ones that might pose an environmental risk, is minimal.The Marinera remains moored in the Moray Firth, with other US-seized vessels being held off the coast of Texas and Puerto Rico.\"If you look at the very high costs that the US is probably incurring at the moment to have two tankers off Houston, awaiting legal action, it's not something you take lightly,\" says Bockmann.A problem of resourcesThen there's the question of what to do with the oil itself.Again, Trump's approach is blunt: confiscate it.The president says 50 million barrels have been taken so far, as the US assumes control of Venezuela's oil industry.\"Venezuela is going to get some and we're going to get some,\" he said in a recent interview.The president's European allies are unlikely to follow suit.\"That would probably be a step too far for the Foreign Office,\" says Keatinge.So would Ukraine's increasingly direct approach. In recent months, Kyiv has targeted at least seven Russian shadow fleet tankers, using a variety of drones and mines.ReutersA Ukrainian sea drone shows the Dashan, a tanker part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\", being struck by another sea drone in the Black SeaMost of Ukraine's attacks have been in the Black Sea, but one tanker, the Qendil, was hit and critically damaged while passing through the Mediterranean in December. Another tanker, the Mersin, was attacked and immobilised off the coast of Senegal in late November. Kyiv has not commented on reports that it carried out the attack.Most of the international effort so far has been more bureaucratic than kinetic: sanctioning hundreds of vessels, persuading countries such as The Gambia, Sierra Leone and Comoros, among others, to tighten their regulations, and addressing the issue of insurance.The number of falsely flagged ships globally more than doubled last year to over 450, according to the IMO, the BBC reported in November.Last year, the European Commission introduced new rules requiring all vessels entering EU waters to provide proof of insurance.The UK has a similar, voluntary reporting scheme, but shadow fleet vessels often ignore it or alter course when challenged.Ultimately, the sheer number of shadow vessels poses a simple problem of resources.But with Russian ships sometimes suspected of involvement in the monitoring or sabotage of undersea cables, there's an added national security dimension.In late January, the UK and thirteen other countries with Baltic and North Sea coastlines issued a coordinated warning that AIS manipulation, along with interference with Global Navigation Satellite Systems represented a growing threat to maritime safety and security.Vessels sailing under flags of convenience, the statement said, \"may be treated as a ship without nationality\", under the terms of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, a reminder to anyone paying attention that existing laws already provide for the detention and seizure of ships.Windward AI's Bockmann says the Trump administration's actions over Venezuela have shown European leaders what can be done.\"There's definitely a low threshold [for intervention] building for the darkest of the dark fleet,\" she says.More from InDepthThe net is gradually closing on Russian oil. Last October, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on the country's two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft.The EU's next sanctions package against Russia may include a full ban on maritime services, making it impossible for European tankers to transport Russian oil under the legal price cap currently in place.Around 30% of Russia's maritime oil exports are currently carried on EU-owned vessels.But for Russia and Iran, war and sanctions are the mothers of invention. As the net tightens, you can be sure that the world's burgeoning fleet of shadow vessels will continue to operate in the dark.Top picture: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "2 hours agoSimon FraserAsia digital editor, LondonReutersVotes are being counted in Bangladesh after the country held its first election since student-led protests ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024.More than 2,000 candidates are vying for a seat in parliament, though none from Hasina's now-banned Awami League party.As many as 1,400 protesters were killed during the 2024 uprising, the UN says - with Hasina accused of having directly ordered the crackdown, an allegation she denies.The election pits the centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) against a coalition led by the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami which has joined forces with a party born out of the student uprising. Results are expected on Friday.Voters were also casting their ballots in a referendum on constitutional change proposed by the interim government to fix what it has called a completely broken political system.Nearly a million police and soldiers have been deployed to maintain law and order.Speaking after voting, interim leader Muhammad Yunus said the country had \"ended the nightmare and begun a new dream\".He voted in the capital Dhaka, as did the two leading candidates, Tarique Rahman for the BNP and Jamaat's leader Shafiqur Rahman.",

    "body": "9 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesBud Cort and Ruth Gordon, who starred in Harold and MaudeUS actor Bud Cort, best known for his role in the 1971 cult classic Harold and Maude, has died aged 77.Writer and producer Dorian Hannaway, a close friend, said he died after \"a long illness\". The BBC has reached out to Cort's representatives.A veteran actor of stage and screen, Cort appeared in more than 80 films and TV series, including Wes Anderson's quirky comedy The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.But it was his star turn as a young, death obsessed Harold who falls in love with Maude, a charming elderly woman played by Ruth Gordon, in Hal Ashby's beloved film that stayed with audiences throughout his 50-year career.While Harold and Maude was originally a commercial and critical flop, it later gained traction in the 1970s through a loyal cult following thanks to its unique dark humour and quirky romantic pairing.\"A young man obsessed with death falls in love with an old woman obsessed with life. She dies and teaches the kid how to live,\" Cameron Crowe described it for AFI in 2011. \"And it's done with music [by Cat Stevens] that scratches at your soul... that movie holds up - to this minute.\"CBS Photo ArchiveA young Bud Cort as Harold Chasen in Harold and MaudeDirector Edgar Wright paid tribute to the actor's work, calling him a \"welcome and magnetic presence in every film lucky enough to have him\".On his performance in Harold and Maude, Wright said: \"Not only is this beloved film a pitch perfect black comedy-cum-love story for the ages, but Bud Cort delivers one of the greatest looks to camera in film.\"The role earned him acting nominations for a Golden Globe and a Bafta.Born in New Rochelle, New York in 1948, Cort showed an early interest in performing and acting in many school productions.Getty ImagesHannaway remembered him as a \"passionate theatregoer\" who would sneak off to Manhattan to see Broadway shows and wait at the backstage door hoping to catch a glimpse of Barbra Streisand after watching Funny Girl.Moving to Los Angeles in the 1960s to pursue a career in film, he was cast in a small part in the 1970 film M*A*S*H, before landing the titular role in Robert Altman's Brewster McCloud.Cort worked steadily throughout his career with supporting roles in films such as Heat, Dogma and Invaders from Mars.He also appeared in several popular TV series including Arrested Development, Ugly Betty and Criminal Minds.",

    "body": "11 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe US House of Representatives has voted to rescind US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods.In a 219 to 211 vote, six Republican lawmakers joined Democrats to back a resolution that seeks to end the tariffs Trump imposed on Canada last year. The vote is largely symbolic as it will still need to be approved by the US Senate and then approved by Trump, who is very unlikely to sign it into law. Since his re-election, Donald Trump has imposed a series of tariffs on Canada, recently threatening a 100% import tax in response to Canada's proposed trade deal with China.As the vote was taking place on the House floor, Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time.\"\"TARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege,\" he added.The vote came after US House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally in Congress, unsuccessfully tried to block discussion on the chamber's floor by lawmakers on Trump's tariffs.With Republicans holding a thin majority in the US House, the six Republican defections along with a near-united front from Democrats was enough to secure the votes.The measure had been introduced by Democrat Gregory Meeks who said that  Trump had \"weaponized tariffs\" against allies and destabilized the global economy.\"Not only have these tariffs done immense harm to our relationship with Canada, pushing them closer to China, they have driven up prices here at home,\" he said before the vote. Representative Don Bacon from Nebraska was one of the six Republicans who crossed the aisle to join Democrats in approving the measure. Before the vote, he said \"tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying.\"The bill now heads to the US Senate where Republicans also hold the majority. Even if it cleared that hurdle, it is unlikely to be signed into law.Meeks, the top Democrat on the US House Foreign Affairs committee, said the measure on Canada is the first of several bills he plans to introduce that aim to roll back Trump's signature trade action.\"Our fight doesn't stop here,\" he said in a video posted online before the vote. \"I have resolutions also to end trump's tariffs on Mexico, on Brazil, and on his Liberation Day global tariffs.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoYvette TanandStephen McDonell,China correspondentGetty ImagesSince coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drivesChinese President Xi Jinping has made a rare public reference to a recent crackdown which saw the country's top military general removed.General Zhang Youxia, who was widely seen as Xi's closest military ally, was removed from his post in January. He was accused of \"serious violations of discipline and law\" - typically a euphemism for corruption.Speaking in a virtual address on Tuesday, Xi said the past year had been \"unusual and extraordinary\", adding that the army had \"undergone revolutionary tempering in the fight against corruption\". Since coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives, which critics say have also been used as a tool to purge political rivals.In his remarks on Tuesday, Xi also added that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had effectively addressed \"various risks and challenges\", adding that many in the army had gone through \"in-depth political rectification\". He also said that PLA troops had been \"loyal to the Party... and proven themselves capable and dependable\". The latest remarks come as part of Xi's annual Chinese New Year greetings to the PLA. This is the first time since 2022 that he has made any reference to corruption in his annual greeting. Zhang, 75, was vice-chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) - a top military leadership group headed by Xi, when he was purged. Another senior officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also removed from his post along with Zhang. The most recent purge comes on the back of another crackdown which saw nine top generals - including some CMC members - removed from their posts in October 2025. Authorities at the time said the purges were part of an anti-corruption drive as well. Records show that 14 full-rank generals have been sacked or investigated in the past three years. The latest purges have decimated the seven-member CMC to just two - of which one is Xi himself.The latest comments by Xi are highly unusual. He never does press conferences or gives interviews - even to the tightly-controlled Chinese media. But even he must occasionally reassure the population, and especially the Party cadres, that what he is doing makes some sort of sense. Speaking about the crackdown is likely designed to convince them that there is a plan in place, especially given that the latest round of purges would have impacted the military's ability to fight and win a war in the immediate future. Xi has made the fight against corruption a central pillar of his rule, calling it the \"biggest threat\" to the Communist Party and saying that the battle \"remains grave and complex\".\"The actual language surrounding the purges do not provide much detail about what exactly is going on internally, whether it really is corruption, political struggles, outright purges, or something else,\" said Professor Chong Ja Ian of the National University of Singapore. \"Publicity surrounding the purges are meant to be a signal, more likely domestic and internal to the CCP than anything else. The suggest the heavy consequences of either being corrupt or not following Xi's preferences closely enough, whatever they may be at a given moment.\"",

Their father was named as Hryhoriy, aged 34.The toddlers' mother Olha, 35, had minor burns - but survived. Russia has renewed its almost daily drone and missile strikes after a week-long pause earlier this month that Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.Ukraine's DSNS emergencies service/Kharkiv regionThe family's house was completely destroyed in the Russian attackIn a statement on social media, Synegubov described the Russian attack on Bohodukhiv as \"brutal\".He said that the family that was in the hit house had recently evacuated from a town near the Russian border, trying to escape constant shelling.\"It was their first night in the new place,\" the regional head added.Bohodukhiv, north-west of Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, has been under almost daily Russian attack in recent days.On Monday,  a 41-year-old woman and a 10-year-old boy were killed in the town, local officials said.Russian forces also dropped seven bombs on the city of Slovyansk on Tuesday, Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram. Three people, including an 11-year-old girl, were killed.Moscow has increased pressure on the area by targeting transport and energy infrastructure with a record number of ballistic missiles, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.A state of emergency has been declared over the energy situation in the Kharkiv region by local authorities.It comes after a so-called \"energy truce\", which was meant to allow Ukraine's energy sector a reprieve during -20C (-4F) temperatures, expired last week.Tens of thousands of people across Ukraine are experiencing severe power cuts, and many households have no running water or heating.Zelensky has said the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, and that both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week. Meanwhile, a massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Volzhsky, in the Volgograd region in Russia, was reported on Wednesday night.Regional Governor Andrei Bocharov said an apartment was damaged in the strike and a fire broke out at a factory. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

    "body": "54 minutes agoAlfred LasteckGetty ImagesEyewitnesses said the boat capsized due to high waves (file photo)At least 21 people have died after a passenger boat sank in River Nile state in northern Sudan, a medical group has told the BBC.  The boat was travelling between the villages of Tayba al-Khawad and Deim al-Qarai, carrying nearly 30 passengers, including women, elderly people and children, the Sudan Doctors Network said. \"Rescue teams are continuing with their work since there could be more bodies,\" said Dr Mohamed Faisal Hassan, the network's spokesperson. Authorities in River Nile state said on Thursday that 21 bodies had been recovered, AFP news agency reported.Eyewitnesses said the boat capsized due to high waves on Wednesday evening in the Shendi area. In an earlier statement, the medical group said six people had survived. The group urged authorities to deploy specialised rescue teams and equipment to accelerate search efforts.It urged authorities to \"take immediate measures to ensure river transport safety and prevent the recurrence of such disasters that claim innocent lives\". \"This painful humanitarian tragedy once again reveals the fragility of river transport and the absence of basic safety requirements,\" it added. Dr Hassan told the BBC that weak regulation of river transport may have contributed to the tragedy.He said many of the boats operating on the Nile were privately owned and that authorities lacked proper regulatory systems and safety measures.Authorities did not immediately respond. Sudan often sees accidents involving traditional boats, which are commonly used to cross the Nile because bridges are scarce, particularly in rural areas.The country has been engulfed in a brutal conflict since April 2023, when fighting erupted between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).The war has devastated large parts of the country, particularly the capital Khartoum and regions such as Darfur, displacing millions and crippling basic services. River Nile State, where the boat accident occurred, has been largely spared from frontline fighting, though the broader instability has strained resources and infrastructure nationwide.More about Sudan from the BBC: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "18 hours agoRobert GreenallandGabriela PomeroyREUTERS/Jennifer GauthierMourners held a candlelit vigil for the victims of the shootingPeople in the small Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge have reacted with shock and disbelief after nine people were killed and at least 25 wounded in a shooting at a local secondary school and home. Members of the remote community, 415 miles (667 km) northeast of the western city of Vancouver, spoke of their fear and uncertainty during the school lockdown, as no-one appeared to be aware of the magnitude of what was unfolding. They described how close the community of just 2500 people was, and how devastated it would be by what had happened.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" town mayor Darryl Krakowka told Canadian broadcaster CBC.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family,\" he added. Chris Norbury, a town councillor, was as close as anyone in Tumbler Ridge to the shooting. His wife teaches at the secondary school, his daughter attends the nearby elementary school and he works at the visitor centre just a block away.Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme, he explained how scared and anxious he felt as he waited for news of his wife.He first realised something was wrong when his daughter's school called him to say they were in lockdown. He was able to contact his wife, who was also under lockdown, but by the time he found out  - from an emergency alert - that there was an active shooter, he was unable to contact her again.\"We just had to speculate and jump into social media to see what was going on - there was a lot of speculation... but being who I am I just wanted to stay calm as best I could and wait for the facts,\" Norbury said.That proved far from easy, though.\"It was terrifying, it's hard to put into words the dread and the fear that you feel knowing that a loved one is in danger,\" he said.Meanwhile he was able to see emergency vehicles, including helicopters, coming and going from the school and a nearby medical centre.That feeling of helplessness and of not knowing what was happening was felt by those within the school too.Bryan Castellarin told the BBC his 15-year-old son Ashton was there while the shooting took place.Ashton and his friends were busy studying in their classroom when \"all of a sudden they heard gunshots going off,\" Castellarin said.\"They were huddled in a corner of the classroom for two to three hours. It felt a lot lot longer.Some of the students were \"really freaking out and crying,\" Bryan said. \"My son was trying to console them. He tried to stay as calm as he could, but he is pretty shaken up, and he is scared... He didn't know where the gunshots were coming from.\"Ashton told his dad it was a terrifying experience, and they didn't know what was going on. Luckily he was unharmed, but he is still waiting to hear information about some of his friends.\"I'm just so thankful that I didn't have to bury my kid,\" Bryan said.'Disturbing' photosDarian Quist, a grade 12 student at the school, was in a classroom with a teacher and about 15 students when the lockdown alarm sounded, though he believes he was in a different part of the school from the shooting. He and his classmates stayed there until the police escorted them out.\"For a while I didn't think anything was going on, but once everything was circulating and we realised something was wrong we got tables and barricaded the doors, and I believe we sat in there for two or two-and-a-half hours,\" he told CBC.He said everyone was tense and nervous. People sent him \"disturbing\" photos, he said, with \"blood and things like that\".\"I think that's when it all set in,\" he said.His mother Shelley Quist was working at the local hospital at the time. She said they only found out about the shooter half an hour after the lockdown - though she was on the phone with her son the whole time.\"It's just one of those things when you just think it's never going to happen,\" she said, adding: \"Panic was setting in until I laid eyes on [Darian].\"Norbury said that it wasn't until after 17:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after the lockdown was first announced - that people started to be released from the school and he was able to find out that his wife was safe.Quist described the departure as \"organised chaos\". \"Professionalism definitely took hold,\" he said.But even then those involved did not know the full extent of what had happened until the casualty figures were revealed.\"A lot of people are shaken up right now, especially when we were told the true numbers,\" Darian Quist said.Though the names of the victims have not yet been released, it is clear the whole town has been deeply affected.Are you in Tumbler Ridge? Share your experiences hereNorbury said he believed he may have known some of the children involved.\"I was a children's librarian for 10 years, and knowing that these children that I likely knew, that I likely read to... these are our friends, our friends' children have been injured, lost their life, and we just have to think how to come together as a community and rely upon each other for support,\" he said.He added: \"Crime is incredibly low here, we've never had anything like this before. It's an incredible shock that anything like this could happen. We're such a tight-knit community, we're really like a family here.\"Norbury also reflected on the effect the shooting would have on the community in the future.\"How many people will be afraid to go to school? How many will this affect for the rest of their lives? And it absolutely will, that's my fear,\" he said. \"If I could talk to those people, I'd say, don't let this define you. Please get help when you need help. We are strong and we are resilient and we will get through this\".",

    "body": "37 minutes agoAnna LamcheWatch: Emotional Prince Harry thanks families for sharing their storiesThe Duke of Sussex has thanked bereaved families mounting a legal challenge against two of the world's biggest tech companies for \"telling your stories over and over again\".Prince Harry made the remarks in an at-times emotional address to parents gathered after the start of a landmark trial in California that will examine whether Instagram and YouTube damage young people's mental health.The families are alleging that the online platforms are addictive by design. Lawyers for YouTube and Meta, which owns Instagram, reject the allegations.Prince Harry expressed hope for \"truth, justice and accountability\" in footage shared exclusively with BBC Breakfast.Ellen RoomePrince Harry thanked families for sharing their stories \"over and over again\"\"We've said time and time again that this is a David versus Goliath situation,\" the prince told the bereaved families, who had gathered on Wednesday evening following the day's court proceedings.\"I've been in some similar situations myself - vastly different - but when you're sitting in court and if you have that feeling of just overwhelming emotion, because you can't believe that the people on the other side are saying what they're saying - that by the very nature of defending what they're defending, the lies that they are stating, is devaluing life, is devaluing your children's lives - if that brings stuff up for you, it is totally normal,\" he said.\"None of you should be here,\" Harry said with an audible warble to his voice. \"Thank you for doing everything that you've done. Thank you for telling your stories over and over again. Truth, justice and accountability: those are the three things that will come from this.\"She told BBC Breakfast that she was among the roughly 50 bereaved parents who were addressed by the prince on Wednesday.\"We can't make a difference for our children, but we can make a difference for other people's children,\" she said.Roome told the programme the trial was \"the first of its kind\" and that \"the world is waking up\" to the danger that \"harmful\" social media content can pose to young people.The case would force the tech giants to take \"accountability\", she said, adding that she thought \"these companies are a law unto their own\".The BBC has approached YouTube and Meta for comment.Meta has said in the past that it wants to keep young people safe online. Over the last two years, it has rolled out certain features for \"teen accounts\" on Instagram, including content filtering for users under 16 years of age. YouTube also has various features to limit content for younger users.The outcome of the case brought in California may also affect separate cases brought by attorneys for dozens of US states seeking tougher restrictions on Meta platforms.",

Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's home\"I hope they get the suspect, because I'm not it,\" Carlos said, according to a video posted on X by CBS reporter Andres Gutierrez.Carlos, reportedly a deliveryman, said he had been driving around and noticed authorities were following him.He added that the officers did not ask him any questions and made him wait for hours in a car park.A woman who identified herself as his mother-in-law earlier said that he had nothing to do with the case.\"They're just invading my property,\" she was quoted as saying by CBS.The Pima County Sherrif's Department had confirmed police were conducting a court-authorised search at a location in Rio Rico, south of Tucson, Arizona.The news of the detention came hours after the FBI released images and videos of a masked person at Nancy Guthrie's doorstep on the night of her disappearance. Authorities said the individual was armed.\"As of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement on X.He said authorities had been working to recover images from the home surveillance system that \"may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors - including the removal of recording devices\".The two short videos show the person approach the front door of Nancy Guthrie's home, then check the camera before moving away, picking up some vegetation from the ground and using it to cover the camera lens.Savannah Guthrie shared the new video on Instagram. \"Someone out there recognises this person,\" she said on Tuesday. \"We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.\"On Wednesday, the FBI said it was conducting an \"extensive search\" in the Catalina Foothills are related to the investigation.A senior official told CBS that the White House was monitoring the situation in Tucson closely. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that US President Donald Trump had reviewed the surveillance footage. Trump's initial reaction to the footage was \"pure disgust\", Leavitt said in response to a question at the press briefing.\"The President directed me to please encourage all Americans with any information to call the FBI,\" she added.US President Donald Trump, who ordered federal authorities to help in the investigation, previously called the case \"very unusual\".Guthrie was last seen at her home in Catalina Foothills, an affluent neighbourhood roughly 6 miles (10km) north-east of Tucson, on the evening of 31 January, when family members dropped her off after dinner.Getty ImagesSavannah Guthrie and her siblings have released videos on social media pleading for their mother's releaseAuthorities are investigating a series of ransom notes that could have been from her abductors, including one that contained two deadlines: 5 February and 9 February.Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have released several videos on social media pleading for their mother's release.The latest video was posted on Monday - the reported ransom deadline. In it, Savannah Guthrie pleads for the public to help locate her missing mother. \"I just want to share a few thoughts as we enter another week of this nightmare,\" she said in a the video posted on Instagram. \"She was taken, and we don't know where. And we need your help.\"The family has warned about their mother's ill health, saying that her health and heart were \"fragile\" and she \"lives in constant pain\".\"She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,\" the news anchor said in a video posted on Instagram.Officials have also warned that Nancy Guthrie may be in dire health without her medication.Authorities said on the night of her disappearance, the app on her pacemaker - an implanted cardiac device - disconnected from her phone.Police also said they found blood on Guthrie's porch and analysis confirmed it was hers.The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for information on the case.",

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond Chia,Business reporterandBen Tavener,in MoscowGetty ImagesRussian regulators are pushing a state-developed app as an alternative to WhatsAppRussia has ordered a block on WhatsApp, as the Kremlin continues to tighten restrictions on messaging apps.Meta-owned WhatsApp said the move aimed to push more than 100 million of its app users in Russia to a \"state-owned surveillance app\".Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the BBC that the decision had been made \"due to [Meta's] unwillingness to comply with the norms and the letter of Russian law\". He has said Meta could resume operations if it \"complies with [the law] and enters into dialogue\".Asked whether authorities were trying to force Russians to use the state-developed Max app, Peskov said the \"national messenger [is an] available alternative\" for Russians.Russian internet regulator Roskomnadzor said this week it was further curbing access to messaging app Telegram as well, citing a lack of security. Telegram is highly popular in Russia and said to be widely used by its forces in Ukraine.Pro-war bloggers have complained that the move was hampering communications on the ground.Even before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russian authorities had begun work on creating a domestic alternative to the global internet. Those moves have gathered pace during the war, along with a push towards state-backed platform called Max.Critics have alleged Max could be used for surveillance by the Russian authorities, though state media have denied that. Max is now being promoted widely inside Russia, through TV advertisements and billboards, by local officials and by the media.Russia has argued that both WhatsApp and Telegram have refused to store Russian users' data in the country as required by law. Authorities in Moscow also allege that WhatsApp is one of the main services used to defraud and extort money from Russians - a reason they cite for people to migrate to the Max app.WhatsApp said it was doing everything it could to keep people connected. \"Trying to isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia,\" it said in a statement.State-run news agency Tass reported earlier this year that WhatsApp was expected to be permanently blocked in the country in 2026.\"Such harsh measures\" are \"absolutely justified\" since Russia has designated Meta as an extremist organisation, Andrei Svintsov, a Russian official, was quoted as saying.WhatsApp was previously Russia's most popular messaging service, but since Meta was labelled as extremist in 2022, its apps such as Instagram and Facebook have been blocked in Russia and are only accessible through virtual private networks (VPNs). Russians are not banned from using its products.Digital rights project Na Svyazi (In Touch) has reported that Russia has increasingly been removing websites from the state-run internet address directory, which is controlled by Roskomnadzor.It said that 13 popular resources were now missing from the National System of Domain Names (NSDI), including YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp web, Instagram, the BBC and Deutsche Welle. Once an entry is removed, the site does not open without a virtual private network (VPN).The app has been likened to China's WeChat - a so-called \"super app\" that combines messaging and government services.Since 2025, the authorities have mandated that the Max app be pre-installed on all new devices sold in the country. There have been reports of public sector employees, teachers and students being increasingly required to use the platform.Telegram's chief executive, Russian-born businessman Pavel Durov, said the state was restricting access to its service in an attempt to force its people to use its own app for surveillance and political censorship.Iran has tried a similar strategy to ban Telegram and push its people to a state-run alternative, but citizens have found ways to work around this, he wrote online.\"Restricting citizens' freedom is never the right answer,\" said Durov.",

    "body": "21 hours agoJaroslav LukivAFP via Getty ImagesStrict handgun laws are already in place across CanadaA deadly mass shooting at a school in British Columbia is likely to increase scrutiny of whether Canada's gun laws should be toughened to prevent further attacks. Nine people were killed and another 25 injured in the attack at Tumbler Ridge on Tuesday, in a remote part of the country that's about 415 miles (667km) north of Vancouver. The suspect was also found dead with a self-inflicted injury, authorities said.Currently, gun ownership in the Canadian provinces is largely federally regulated by the government in Ottawa, and there are stricter laws in place than in most US states.Mass shootings in Canada are rare, especially if compared with its southern neighbour.Still, gun-related killings as a percentage of all homicides are significantly higher in Canada than in England and Wales, or Australia.Tumbler Ridge mass shooting live updatesCurrent gun laws in CanadaUnder Canada's Firearms Act, guns must be kept locked and unloaded. Anyone wishing to buy a firearm is also subject to extensive background checks and needs to have a licence.Across the country, more than 2.2 million people - or 7.7% of Canada's adult population - had firearm licences, according to government statistics from 2021.An estimated 10 million firearms were in circulation in the country that year.According to a Canadian website on gun ownership, which obtained statistics from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or RCMP, there were 355,678 gun licences in British Columbia as of 2023, or about 6,240 gun licenses per 100,000 people. But the website cautioned that many people own guns without a licence, which is illegal.A national freeze on the sale and transfer of handguns has also been in place since 2022. In January, the government began a national gun buy-back programme. A federal pilot programme in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, which aimed to collect 200 firearms, had only collected 26.Mass shootings in Canada over the yearsThe latest mass shooting follows a string of others over the past decade.In the wake of the attacks, most military-grade assault-style weapons were banned in the country.In 2014, a gunman shot dead eight people, including two children, in Edmonton,  Alberta, in western Canada.One of the deadliest shootings in the country took place decades earlier - in 1989. Fourteen women were killed by a gunman in an anti-feminist attack at l'École Polytechnique university in Montreal.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJake KwonSeoul correspondentWatch: See Kim Ju Ae, the only known child of Kim Jong Un, attend events with her father over the yearsNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has selected his daughter as his heir, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday. Little is known about Kim Ju Ae, who in recent months has been pictured beside her father in high-profile events like a visit to Beijing in September- her first known trip abroad. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it took a \"range of circumstances\" into account including her increasingly prominent public presence at official events\" in making this assessment.The NIS also said it would keep close tabs on whether she will attend the North's party congress later this month - its largest political event that is held once every five years.The party Congress is where Pyongyang is expected to give more details about priorities like foreign policy, war planning and nuclear ambitions for the next five years.On Thursday lawmaker Lee Seong-kwen told reporters that Ju Ae, who was previously described by the NIS as being \"trained\" to be a successor, was now at the stage of \"successor designation\". \"As Kim Ju Ae has shown her presence at various events, including the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army and her visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, and signs have been detected of her voicing her opinion on certain state policies, the NIS believes she has now entered the stage of being designated as successor,\" Lee said.Ju Ae is the only known child of Kim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju. The NIS believes Kim Jong Un has an older son, but this son has never been acknowledged nor shown on North Korean media.News of Ju Ae's existence first emerged through an unlikely source: the American basketball player Dennis Rodman, who revealed to The Guardian newspaper back in 2013 that he \"held baby Ju Ae\" during a trip to the secretive state.Ju Ae - who is believed to be 13 - made her first appearance on state television in 2022. She was shown inspecting North Korea's latest intercontinental ballistic missile while holding her father's hand. She has since made frequent appearances on on state media, softening her father's image of a ruthless dictator.  She accompanied him to Beijing for China's largest-ever military parade, where she was seen stepping off his armoured train at Beijing Railway Station.She is often seen wearing her hair long, which is forbidden for her peers, and wearing designer clothes, which are out of reach for most in her country.Another lawmaker, Park Sun-won said the role Ju Ae had taken on during public events indicated that she has started to provide policy input and is being treated as the de facto second-highest leader. The North Korean power had passed down the three generations of the Kim family, and it is widely believed that Kim Jong Un will pass on the throne to Ju Ae.In recent months, she was shown standing taller than her father, walking beside him, rather than following him. In North Korea, where photos published by the state media are believed to carry a great symbolic weight, it is rare for individuals other than Kim Jong Un to be positioned equally prominently in the frame.EPAAlthough the South Korean spy agency now believes Ju Ae is the designated heir, it still raises questions.It is puzzling why Ju Ae, a daughter, would be selected as the heir above an older son in North Korea's deeply patriarchal society. Many defectors and analysts had previously dismissed the idea of a woman leading North Korea as an unlikely scenario, referring to the country's entrenched traditional gender roles. But Kim Jong Un's sister - Kim Yo Jong - does offer a precedent for female authority in the regime.Kim Yo Jong currently holds a senior position in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and is reported to have influence over her brother.However, it is also a mystery why Kim Jong Un, who is still young and appears relatively healthy, is already designating a 13-year-old child as his heir now.It is unclear what changes Ju Ae's succession may bring to North Korea. Many North Koreans hoped that Kim Jong Un, a Western-educated young man, would open their country up to the outside when he succeeded his father. Yet such hope was unfulfilled. Whatever plans this teenager may have for her country, she would likely have the singular power to shape it however she likes.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesA mourner visits a memorial at a candlelit vigil in Tumbler Ridge.An 18-year-old has been named as the suspect in a shooting that killed eight people and injured dozens more in British Columbia, Canada.Police said Jesse Van Rootselaar was found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot injury. The motive for the attack is not yet known.Six people were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Two others - the suspect's mother, 39, and step-brother, 11 - were found dead at a nearby home. Hundreds of mourners gathered to exchange comfort and moments of silence in Tumbler Ridge's main square and outside the British Columbia legislature in Victoria on Wednesday night.Getty Images\"Schools should be safe,\" said Tumbler Ridge vigil attendee Gigi Rejano said, according to the AFP news agency, while others cried nearby and pictures of victims were laid near a tree.In Victoria, speaker of the legislature Raj Chouhan said, \"We can only pray together, hold hands together and send our love to all those people\", according to a local journalist. The shooting at the nearby home occurred first, then the suspect went to the school, McDonald said.The victims at the school were a 39-year-old female educator, three female students, all aged 12, and two male students, one aged 12 and the other 13. Authorities do not believe there are other suspects involved in the shootings.Police said they had attended the suspect's family home on multiple occasions over the past several years, with some calls related to mental health concerns.Authorities said Van Rootselaar was born a biological male but identified as a woman.\"I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who approximately six years ago began to transition to female,\" Dwayne McDonald, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner, said. Van Rootselaar was known to police, and \"we've begun the process of reaching out to\" the public health care system to \"understand what interactions may have taken place,\" British Columbia Premier David Eby told a news conference outside the Tumbler Ridge town hall late on Wednesday evening.The suspect previously had a valid gun licence that had since lapsed, McDonald said.Police said Van Rootselaar had dropped out of Tumbler Ridge Secondary School four years ago. Around 13:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Tuesday, police received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Officers arrived on the scene within two minutes of the call, heard active gunfire and entered the school, McDonald said. Within minutes they located the shooter, who was deceased from what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities found two firearms - a long gun and a modified handgun - on the scene. But McDonald said it remains unclear the exact roles the firearms played in the shooting. Police then began searching for victims throughout the school. Two victims were taken to hospital by air ambulance and remain in hospital. Tumbler Ridge has about 2,400 residents, and its secondary school has 160 students in Grades 7-12.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the students and teachers \"bore witness to unheard-of cruelty\" during the shooting, noting that some victims remain in hospital \"fighting for their lives\".Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka told reporters late on Wednesday the close-knit community was \"one big family.\"\"Lend your ear when someone needs your ear,\" he said, growing emotional at times. \"Lend your shoulder when someone needs your shoulder. Give somebody a hug.\"Are you in Tumbler Ridge? Get in touch here",

Madagascar's disaster management office said there was \"total chaos\" - reporting that houses collapsed in the impact zone, where the bodies were found. Neighbourhoods were plunged into darkness as power lines snapped, while trees were uprooted and roofs ripped off.\"What happened is a disaster, nearly 75% of the city of Toamasina was destroyed,\" the country's military leader Colonel Michael Randrianirina, who seized power in October, told the AFP news agency.\"The current situation exceeds Madagascar's capabilities alone,\" he added.The cyclone's landfall is likely to have been one of the most intense recorded around the city in the satellite era, according to the CMRS cyclone forecaster on France's Reunion island, AFP reports.The National Office for Risk and Disaster Management said many were killed when houses collapsed. Cyclone Gezani hit Toamasina - the country's second-largest city - with winds reaching 250 km/hour (155 mph). \"It's total chaos, 90% of house roofs have been blown off, entirely or in part,\" the head of disaster management at the Action Against Hunger aid agency, Rija Randrianarisoa, told AFP.Madagascar's disaster management office has evacuated dozens of injured people and hundreds of residents from a district around Toamasina, home to 400,000 people.Residents in and around Toamasina described scenes of chaos as the cyclone made landfall. \"I have never experienced winds this violent...

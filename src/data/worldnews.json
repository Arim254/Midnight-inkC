    "body": "6 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporter, Calgary, AlbertaReutersPierre Poilievre spoke to a full room of Conservative supporters in Calgary on Friday, where he pitched himself to stay on as leaderPierre Poilievre has cemented his position as Canada's Conservative Party leader, having received a strong endorsement from members despite presiding over recent electoral defeats.He secured 87.4% of votes in the leadership review, held on Friday in Calgary among delegates instead of the wider membership, after delivering a speech calling for Canadians to stay united in the face of an \"uncertain world\" and amid growing separatist sentiments in Alberta and Quebec. \"A house divided cannot stand,\" Poilievre said.A leadership review is automatically triggered after an election loss - in this case Poilievre's defeat to Mark Carney's Liberals last April, in which he also lost his own seat. Despite the political setbacks, delegates who spoke to the BBC said that they still had confidence in Poilievre to lead them into the next election.\"As far as the party is concerned, I think we're in the right direction,\" said Thomas Bambrick, a delegate from Winnipeg, adding that the vote result equals to a \"resounding yes\" for trust in the Conservative leader. Ahead of the vote, Poilievre delivered a nearly hour-long speech that doubled as a pitch to Conservative voters at the party's convention in Calgary, Alberta, where he outlined his vision for Canada's future should his party form the next government. Canada's conservative leader faces leadership testWho is Pierre Poilievre?He focused much of his messaging on affordability and crime - issues that have long resonated with his base - and promised a small government that would represent \"people who have felt unseen for too long\". Poilievre also touched on geopolitical tensions facing Canada, including its strained relationship with the US, arguing that the same domestic policies he was pitching will also help Canada \"stand on its own two feet\". His speech was made on a backdrop of a growing grassroots separatist movement in the Conservative stronghold of Alberta, where a process of collecting signatures to trigger an independence referendum is under way. In Quebec, the sovereignist Parti Québécois is also polling ahead, promising its own independence referendum in the province should it be elected to the provincial government later this year. Poilievre addressed these threats to Canadian unity in his speech, blaming the Liberal Party for people losing \"hope in the confederation\". Party members who spoke to the BBC said the speech was well received, praising it for sticking to traditional Conservative messaging while also confronting separatism - what one member called \"the elephant in the room\".Ballots in Friday's vote were cast in person by delegates who were selected to represent Conservative voters in each constituency across Canada.Poilievre has remained popular with his party despite the Conservative's unexpected loss last year, as well as the loss of the seat he had held for more than 20 years.In recent months, two elected Conservative MPs have left the party to join the Liberals, who under Carney have adopted more centrist policies, raising questions about the party's unity and Poilievre's leadership. But supporters of Poilievre credit him with delivering historic gains for the party, which received a record 41% of the popular vote last year. In particular, the Conservative leader has been successful in courting young voters through his messaging on affordability issues like the cost of living and housing. He has struggled, however, with defining his party's stance on US President Donald Trump, whom many Canadians have come to view as an existential threat due to his tariffs on Canadian goods and his rhetoric around it becoming the 51st US state.Poilievre has also struggled with his likeability, with surveys showing that more than half of Canadians hold a negative view of him. Many cite his tone, which they view as overly combative. Polls indicate his party is still trailing, with a Léger poll released this week showing the Conservatives nine points behind the Liberals.Poilievre addressed some of the shortcomings in his speech on Friday, telling party members that a lesson he learned is to not waver on his messaging. \"You told us to ignore the voices who keep telling us to abandon our conservative principles,\" he said as the audience applauded. \"We will stay true to our principles.\"",

    "body": "44 minutes agoMaia DaviesBBCOfficials say a gas leak was the blame for the explosion in Bandar AbbasFive people have been killed in two separate explosions in Iran which local officials and state media say were caused by gas leaks.One person was killed and 14 injured in a blast at a residential building in the southern city of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf coast, a local official told Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency.Another explosion killed four people in the south-western city of Ahvaz, the state-run Tehran Times reported.It comes as tensions persist in the region after a build-up of US forces in the Gulf and pressure from President Donald Trump that Tehran strike a deal on its nuclear programme.In the port city of Bandar Abbas, state TV said the explosion had ripped though an eight-floor building, \"destroying two floors, several vehicles, and shops\" in the Moallem Boulevard area.The local fire department chief Mohammad Amin Liaqat said a preliminary assessment showed it had been caused by a gas leak and \"build-up\".\"My colleagues will give more details in the next few hours,\" he said in a video published by Mehr.Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, a regional official, told the news agency that the injured had been taken to hospital.Meanwhile, semi-official news agency Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards navy commander had been targeted in the blast.Elsewhere, Tehran Times reported a second explosion at a residential building in the Kianshahr neighbourhood of Ahvaz, near the border with Iraq.It reported that emergency officials had rescued a child trapped beneath debris and transferred him for medical treatment.Trump said on Wednesday that time was \"running out\" for Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear programme, after a large US naval fleet had gathered near the country.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.The country's foreign minister said on Friday that its missile defence system would \"never\" be the subject of negotiation but that Tehran was open to talks with the US provided they were based on trust and respect.Trump's warning came after he had promised to intervene to help those involved in a brutal crackdown on protests in the country earlier this month, before saying he had been told the execution of protesters had stopped.He has since said Tehran must do to two things to avoid military action - \"no nuclear\" and \"stop killing protesters\" - and that he knew they \"want to make a deal\" rather than face US intervention.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.",

    "body": "15 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe US federal government has partially shutdown despite a last-ditch funding deal approved by the Senate.The funding lapse began at midnight US eastern time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday, hours after senators agreed to fund most agencies until September. The bill includes just two weeks' funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, instead of shutting it down entirely.The bill has yet to be approved by the House of Representatives, which is out of session.US President Donald Trump struck the deal with Democrats after they refused to give more funding for immigration enforcement following the fatal shooting of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents.It is the second such government shutdown in the past year and comes just 11 weeks after the end of the previous funding impasse that lasted 43 days, the longest in US history. That shutdown in 2025, which spanned 1 October to 14 November, had widespread impacts on essential government services including air travel and left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay for weeks.This shutdown, however, is unlikely to be that long or widespread as the House of Representatives is set to be back in session on Monday. The White House, though, has directed several agencies, including the departments of transportation, education and defence to execute shutdown plans.\"Employees should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities,\" a White House memo to agencies said. \"It is our hope that this lapse will be short.\"Trump has urged Republicans, who hold the majority of seats in the US House, to vote for the deal.Lawmakers plan to use the fortnight in which the DHS will continue to be funded to negotiate a deal. Democrats want that deal to include new policies for immigration enforcement agents.\"We need to rein in ICE and end the violence,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\"That means ending roving patrols. It means requiring rules, oversight, and judicial warrants... Masks need to come off, cameras need to stay on, and officers need visible identification. No secret police.\"Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticised tactics used by immigration agents in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last weekend.Pretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot by a US Border Patrol agent after an altercation in which several agents tried to restrain him. On Friday, the Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation into the shooting.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMaia DaviesReutersElon Musk - the boss of SpaceX as well as Tesla and X - is the world's richest personElon Musk's SpaceX has applied to launch one million satellites into Earth's orbit to power artificial intelligence (AI).The application claims \"orbital data centres\" are the most cost and energy-efficient way to meet the growing demand for AI computing power.Traditionally, such centres are large warehouses full of powerful computers which process and store data. Musk's aerospace firm claims processing needs due to the expanding use of AI are already outpacing \"terrestrial capabilities\".It would increase the number of SpaceX satellites in orbit drastically. Its existing Starlink network of nearly 10,000 satellites has already been accused of creating congestion in space, which Musk denies.The new network could comprise up to one million solar-powered satellites, according to the application filed on Friday with the Federal Communications Commission - which does not specify a timeline for the plan.SpaceX claims the system would deliver the computer capacity required to serve \"billions of users globally\".It also says it would be the first step towards \"becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation - one that can harness the Sun's full power\", referencing a scale of hypothetical alien societies proposed by an astronomer in the 1960s.Musk wrote on his social media site X: \"The satellites will actually be so far apart that it will be hard to see from one to another. Space is so vast as to be beyond comprehension.\"Like the Starlink satellites, which provide high-speed internet, they would operate in low-Earth orbit at altitudes from 500-2,000km (310-1,242 miles).SpaceX claims \"orbital data centres\" - a concept also being explored by other firms - would be a greener alternative to traditional centres, which require enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.An expert previously told the BBC that launching hardware into orbit remains expensive and that the infrastructure to protect, cool and power them can be complex - while a growing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.Meanwhile, astronomers complained in 2024 that radio waves from the Starlink network were \"blinding\" their telescopes and hindering their research.Musk has previously rejected claims that his satellites were taking up too much room and crowding out competitors.",

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul NjieHassan Lali / BBCSources say the mine, currently under rebel control, has been poorly maintainedMore than 200 people have been killed in a mine collapse in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, rebel authorities have said.The mine, in the town of Rubaya, gave way on Wednesday due to heavy rains, Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesman for the North Kivu region's rebel governor, told reporters. At the time, the death toll remained unclear.Women and children were among those mining coltan - a mineral used to manufacture electronics such as smartphones and computers - at the time.A former supervisor of the mine told the BBC the site was not properly maintained, making accidents more likely and hampering rescue efforts when they occur.He added that the fragile nature of the soil made the situation worse.Women, children and artisanal miners - those not officially employed by a mining firm - are among those killed in the collapse. Around 20 survivors are said to be receiving treatment in hospital.A source whose cousin died in the landslide expressed shock, saying it was \"a big loss\" for the family and community.\"I didn't believe he could pass away in such circumstances,\" the source, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC, describing his cousin as a \"courageous\" and \"ambitious\" man whose main goal was to provide for his wife and two children.\"I didn't believe [he was dead] because investigations were still ongoing. His body wasn't found after the accident, so I did have hope that he could be found alive. Unfortunately, some hours later, his body was discovered.\"Governor Erasto Bahati Musanga, who was appointed by M23 rebels after seizing swathes of territory in North Kivu, visited survivors of the incident on Friday.Rubaya is one of a number of towns across North Kivu under the control of the M23, who international observers say are backed by neighbouring Rwanda.The mines in Rubaya hold about 15% of the world's coltan supply and half of the DR Congo's total deposits. The metallic ore contains tantalum, which is used to produce high-performance capacitors in a range of electronic devices, making it in high demand worldwide.When a BBC team visited the site in July 2025, they observed miners digging manually to source the precious mineral. Conditions at the site are very bad, with dangerous pits dotted around its vast expanse.Since 2024, the M23 rebels have been in control of the mines. The UN has accused the group of imposing taxes on the mining sector for their own benefit.The BBC has contacted the Congolese government in Kinshasa for comment.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesThe event at the Yasukuni Shrine (pictured) \"should not have been held in the first place\", the Pokémon Company saidA Pokémon card game event at a shrine honouring Japan's war dead has been cancelled following a backlash in China.The Pokémon Company apologised for advertising the event, organised by a certified third party, through its official website, and said it \"should not have been held in the first place\".The event was due to be held on Saturday at the Yasukuni Shrine, near the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, which commemorates those who died in several wars including convicted war criminals.The blunder comes at a moment of worsening relations between China and Japan over the stance of the latter's new prime minister on Taiwan.The Yasukuni Shrine honours Japanese soldiers who died in a number of wars, including both Sino-Japanese wars and the Pacific theatre of World War Two.But the enshrinement of the names of more than 1,000 convicted war criminals among the roughly 2.5 million people it honours has long made it a controversial site for nations that were subject to harsh treatment under Japanese occupation.\"Brands that disregard history and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people will ultimately be abandoned,\" the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official news site, commented when the event came to light earlier this week. \"The relevant enterprises must accordingly take social responsibility and not make light of the heavy weight of history in the name of entertainment.\"Meanwhile, the state-run Global Times praised \"China's young net­izens\" for criticising the event, adding: \"Any enter­tain­ment or leis­ure activ­it­ies held at such a site con­sti­tute an open affront to his­tor­ical truth, and sta­ging events aimed at children there is even more egre­gious.\"The Pokémon Company said in a statement on Friday that the event had been \"mistakenly posted\" on its official card game website \"due to a lack of due diligence\".\"After the incident was discovered, the event was promptly cancelled,\" it said. \"We sincerely apologise for the various reactions and opinions that have been generated as a result of this publication.\"The firm said it would \"thoroughly review and strengthen\" its approval process to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.Beijing claims the self-governing island as part of its territory, and has not ruled out taking it by force.The row saw the governments of both nations urge their citizens not to travel to the other, while the release of two popular Japanese films in China were also postponed.Pokémon, which began as a video game in 1996, has since become an internationally renowned media franchise spanning films, TV series and trading card games.",

    "body": "21 hours agoBrandon DrenonReutersLuigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, will not face the death penalty if convicted, a court has ruled.US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed the federal firearms charges against the 27-year-old that carried the possibility of capital punishment.He will still face stalking charges, which can bring a maximum sentence of life in prison.Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as the health insurance firm CEO walked into a New York City hotel on 4 December 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to all federal and state charges.After the ruling, Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo thanked the court for \"this incredible decision\", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"We're all very relieved,\" she said. \"We're prepared, and have been prepared, to fight this case, and we look forward to fighting this case.\"In her ruling, Garnett, an appointee of former US President Joe Biden, said two of the four federal charges did not meet \"the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law\". She noted that her decision was \"solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury\".Garnett's ruling was a setback for the justice department, which had called Thompson's murder a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination\".The judge has given the government 30 days to challenge her decision to rule out the death penalty in the case.In a win for prosecutors, Garnett said they could present evidence to the jury from Mangione's backpack that he had at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.Among the items in the bag were a gun, fake IDs and a notebook with writings that allegedly detailed Mangione's grievances against the US healthcare system. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it illegally without a warrant. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a wealthy Maryland family, is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder.Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, was shot from behind by a masked gunman as he walked into a Manhattan hotel for an annual investor conference. Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Thompson's murder.Law enforcement sources say this may have been a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.Jury selection in the federal trial is due to begin on 8 September, with opening statements due to start on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as July.In a separate incident, a Minnesota man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Mangione from the Brooklyn jail he is being held in. The suspect - Mark Anderson - was carrying a barbecue fork and pizza cutter, prosecutors say. He is now being held at the same facility as Mangione.",

    "body": "23 hours agoMaia DaviesEPATrump declined to say whether there was a timeline for withdrawing a large US naval fleet from waters near IranDonald Trump has said Iran wants to make a deal rather than face US military action, despite Tehran's insistence that its missile and defence systems will \"never\" be up for negotiation.\"I can say this, they do want to make a deal,\" the US president told reporters at the White House on Friday when asked about a build-up of forces in the Gulf, without providing details.He had warned Tehran on Wednesday that time was \"running out\" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme after a large US naval fleet had gathered near the country.Iran's foreign minister said there were no talks planned with the US at present but that Tehran was open to negotiations based on \"mutual respect\" and trust.Also on Friday, the Kremlin said the head of the Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani had met Russian President Vladimir Putin.They discussed \"Middle Eastern and international issues\" among other matters, state news agency Ria-Novosoti reported.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Asked on Friday whether he had given Tehran a deadline by which to strike a deal, Trump said that \"only they know for sure\".He told reporters: \"Hopefully we'll make a deal. If we do make a deal, that's good. If we don't make a deal, we'll see what happens.\"He said a large \"Armada\" was on its way to the region and declined to give a timeline for its withdrawal: \"We'll see how it all works out. They have to float someplace, so they might as well float near Iran.\"Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that the country's missile defence systems would \"never\" be on the negotiating table, and repeated the government's position that its nuclear programme was peaceful.At a press conference with his Turkish counterpart after talks in Istanbul to avert US action, he said preparations were needed for \"fair and just negotiations\".He had said help was \"on the way\", before saying he had been told the execution of demonstrators had stopped.On Thursday, he said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people, including more than 5,900 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December.It said it was also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.",

    "body": "1 day agoMaia DaviesAPAlex Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospitalThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents, the US deputy attorney general has said.Todd Blanche said he did not want to \"overstate\" the move, calling it \"a standard investigation by the FBI when there are circumstances like what we saw\".The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the FBI would lead the investigation into Pretti's shooting in Minneapolis, with support from the DOJ's Civil Rights Division. His death came just weeks after Renee Good was shot dead by federal officers in the same city.\"We're looking at everything that would shed light on that day,\" Blanche told a news conference.He added the investigation would \"to the extent it needs to\" involve lawyers at the civil rights division.The investigation was previously being led by the Homeland Security Investigations branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.According to a preliminary DHS report sent to Congress, two officers fired their weapons at Pretti during a scuffle. Initial official accounts had alleged Pretti brandished his gun.The 37-year-old intensive care nurse, who was a US citizen, is understood to have joined protests in the city after Renee Good was shot dead by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on 7 January.Their deaths sparked fresh demonstrations in the state, and prompted public outcry across the US and criticism from lawmakers in both parties.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for federal agents to be withdrawn entirely from the state's capital region.The state has also asked a federal judge to stop Operation Metro Surge, the DHS's immigration enforcement initiative which began on 1 December and involves some 3,000 officers.President Donald Trump has said his administration is \"going to de-escalate a little bit\" in Minnesota, while his border tsar Tom Homan said on Thursday that the administration planned to \"draw down\" federal forces if local officials co-operated.\"We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter,\" Homan told a news conference in Minneapolis, without specifying what form a de-escalation might take.",

    "body": "2 hours agoOttilie MitchellWatch: Nationwide anti-ICE protests draw large crowdsA federal judge on Saturday denied a state government request to block the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  In a ruling, District Court Judge Katherine Menendez said the immigration enforcement operation \"has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking, consequences on the State of Minnesota\". But, she said, state officials had not proved that the Trump administration's surge of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis was unlawful. The ruling comes as thousands nationwide have taken to the streets to protest the fatal shootings of two US citizens by federal agents.Demonstrators are expected to gather on Saturday afternoon in Minneapolis, after protests were also held in cities across the US on Friday, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC. Organisers called on Americans to stay home from work and school.The deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have caused public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties.The 37-year-old nurse was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state. Good, the first, was killed by an ICE agent on 7 January.In her ruling on Saturday, Judge Menendez said there was \"evidence that ICE and CBP agents have engaged in racial profiling, excessive use of force, and other harmful actions\". But, she said, state officials \"have provided no metric by which to determine when lawful law enforcement becomes unlawful commandeering\". State and local officials had argued in their lawsuit that Trump's deployment of 3,000 immigration agents despite objections violated the state's sovereignty. Organisers of nationwide protests on Friday, called the National Shutdown, urged \"no work. No school. No shopping\" on 30 January to send the message to \"stop funding ICE\".The action was organised over the deaths of Pretti and Good, as well as others killed by ICE, including Silverio Villegas-Gonzales, who was shot by an ICE agent in September 2025, according to the group's website.Protesters formed the letters \"SOS\" on top of a frozen lake in southern Minneapolis, while one group marched through the streets carrying a large-scale replica of the preamble to the US constitution.Singer Bruce Springsteen also performed a newly released song in honour of Pretti and Good entitled Streets of Minneapolis at a concert in the city. Getty ImagesDemonstrators spell out an SOS signal of distress on a frozen Lake Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis On Thursday, border tsar Tom Homan suggested the Trump administration could \"draw down\" federal forces in the state if local officials co-operate.\"We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter,\" he said during a news conference. Homan began leading on-the-ground efforts in Minneapolis after it was announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving the area.US President Donald Trump said on Thursday evening: \"We will keep our country safe, we'll do whatever we can to keep our country safe.\" About 3,000 federal agents were sent to Minnneapolis at Trump's directive.The DHS has said it was arresting the \"worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota, but critics argue migrants with clean records and US citizens are being caught up in the campaign.Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, the immigration enforcement initiative has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul and other cities in the state.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called on federal agents to withdraw from Minneapolis.Getty Images",

    "body": "1 day agoNicolas NégoceBBC Africa, AbidjanAFP/Getty ImagesMamadou Hawa Gassama, seen here on a demonstration in 2018, is known for his outspokennessA Malian lawmaker has been jailed in neighbouring Ivory Coast for three years for insulting the 84-year-old Ivorian leader, who recently won a fourth term in office.Mamadou Hawa Gassama, who serves in the transitional parliament set up by Mali's junta, was arrested last July while on a trip to Ivory Coast.Prosecutors said he described President Alassane Ouattara as a \"tyrant\", \"an enemy of Mali\" and strongly criticised his leadership in interviews and on social media.Since Mali's military took power in 2020, relations with Ivory Coast have been strained. Ouattara, an ally of France - the former colonial power in both nations - has been critical of the takeover and other coups in West Africa.Since the Malian politician's arrest in Abidjan last July, the authorities in Bamako have not commented on the case.\"We believe that this decision is... excessive... it is very severe,\" the AFP news agency quotes Gassama's lawyer Mamadou Ismaila Konate as saying.Prosecutors argued that Gassama's remarks went beyond political critique, accusing him of deliberately seeking to undermine Ivorian institutions and sow discord between the two neighbours.It is a reminder of the diplomatic row that blew up two years after the coup, when 49 Ivorian soldiers were sentenced in Mali to 20 years in prison for undermining state security.Since then, Mali's military leaders have overseen the exit of the UN peacekeeping mission and French forces, which had deployed to Mali in 2013 to help deal with an escalating jihadist insurgency.Instead it has sought closer ties with Russia - and Russian mercenaries have been brought in to deal with the insecurity affecting several countries in the vast Sahel region.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "2 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosAnadolu via Getty ImagesSeveral strikes have been reported across the Strip, including in Khan YounisAt least 32 people have been killed in a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, according to local authorities.The civil defence agency, which is operated by Hamas, says children and women were among those killed. It added that in one attack, helicopter gunships hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis.Palestinians have described these strikes as the heaviest since the second phase of the ceasefire, brokered by President Trump in October, came into effect earlier this month.The Israeli military confirmed that a number of strikes were carried out in response to what it said was a Hamas violation of the agreement on Friday.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce since it came into effect last year.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said \"eight terrorists were identified exiting the underground terror infrastructure in eastern Rafah\", an area in Gaza where Israeli forces are deployed under the October agreement.The IDF said it had, together with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), struck targets in various locations including \"four commanders and additional terrorists\" as well as a weapons storage facility, a weapons manufacturing site and \"two launch sites belonging to Hamas in the central Gaza Strip\".Hamas has condemned the strikes and urged the US to take immediate action, adding that \"these ongoing violations\" confirm that the Israeli government \"continues its brutal war of genocide against the strip\".It said that seven of the victims were from one displaced family in Khan Younis, with a civil defence spokesman adding that the strikes hit residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station.Officials at Gaza City's Shifa hospital said an air strike on the city hit a residential apartment, killing three children and two women.\"We found my three little nieces in the street. They say 'ceasefire' and all. What did those children do? What did we do?\" said Samer al-Atbash, an uncle of the three dead children, according to Reuters news agency.Video footage and images from across Gaza showed several bodies being lifted out of rubble and a number of buildings destroyed.ReutersA police station was also hit in Gaza City, local authorities say, killing at least 12Egypt's foreign ministry condemned the strikes in a statement seen by AFP news agency, and urged all parties to \"exercise the utmost restraint\".Qatar, one of the key mediators during ceasefire talks, also denounced the \"repeated Israeli violations\", its foreign ministry said.The war between Israel and Hamas began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.The health ministry's figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media. Israel does not allow news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza to report independently.",

    "body": "1 day agoMaia DaviesandImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentGetty ImagesAntónio Guterres said the organisation's money could run out by JulyThe United Nations is at risk of \"imminent financial collapse\" due to member states not paying their fees, the body's head has warned.António Guterres said the UN faced a financial crisis which was \"deepening, threatening programme delivery\", and that money could run out by July.He wrote in a letter to all 193 member states that they had to honour their mandatory payments or overhaul the organisation's financial rules to avoid collapse.It comes after the UN's largest contributor, the US, refused to contribute to its regular and peacekeeping budgets, and withdrew from several agencies it called a \"waste of taxpayer dollars\". Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay.Though the UN General Assembly did approve a partial change to its financial system in late 2025, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis compounded by a rule that means it is refunding money it never received.At its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down.Guterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was \"categorically different\".\"Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced,\" the secretary general said, without naming specific members.He said the \"integrity of the entire system\" depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their \"assessed contributions\" - adding that 77% of the total owed had been paid in 2025, leaving a record amount unpaid.Guterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a \"double blow\" in which it was \"expected to give back cash that does not exist\".\"I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received.\"As a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars it never actually had. The letter reads: \"Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m [£165m]  – funds we have not collected.\"\"The bottom line is clear,\" Guterres wrote. \"Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse.\"UN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult. The US is the UN's largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its \"great potential\" and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts.The US did not pay its contribution to the UN's regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations.Other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN's work.Guterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a \"race to bankruptcy\".Trump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza.The US president has said its work would happen \"in conjunction with the United Nations\" - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN's place, he replied: \"Well, it might.\"The US officially left the UN's World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so.Other agencies are also making huge cuts. The UN's human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity.In Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.",

    "body": "Healthcare, visas and whisky: What did UK and China get from Starmer's visit?1 day agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesChina and the UK have called for a reset in economic relationsSir Keir Starmer's visit to China this week is the clearest sign yet the two countries are seeking to end the diplomatic \"ice age\" that has defined their relationship.Both leaders face economic pressures at home and are seeking new opportunities for trade and investment.For Sir Keir, the first UK prime minister to visit China since Theresa May in 2018, the trip was a chance to highlight the strength of British firms in finance, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, clean energy and car making.President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, aimed to show that China can be a reliable partner for Western economies, as US President Donald Trump continues to rattle the global trading system.Although no sweeping free trade deal was reached, the visit marked a cautious but tangible reset of UK–China economic ties.Agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green technology and finance, combined with revived dialogue, might lead to better access for British firms to Chinese markets and greater Chinese investment in the UK.What deals were agreed?The biggest commercial announcement came from AstraZeneca, which promised to invest $15bn (£11bn) in China over the next four years, to expand research and the manufacturing of medicines – the company's biggest investment in China to date.In the energy sector, British firm Octopus Energy is entering the Chinese market for the first time through a partnership with local company PCG Power to develop a digital platform for trading electricity.The project aims to improve efficiency in the power system and support China's efforts to increase the use of renewable energy.For Octopus, which has grown quickly in the UK, the deal allows entry into China's large and growing energy market, where demand for clean energy and digital trading is rising.Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy who was part of the UK's business delegation to China flagged that the country's scale and innovation have made solar, wind energy and batteries cheaper. \"Now there's a huge opportunity for Britain to succeed as we build the solutions that use these products to cut the cost of electricity,\" he added.China also agreed to halve tariffs on Scotch whisky, a deal the UK government said could generate £250m for the British economy over the next five years.\"Our whisky distilleries are the jewel in Scotland's crown,\" Sir Keir said. This is \"proof that our pragmatic, hard-headed international engagement brings benefits at home\", he added.Scotch whisky is a key export for Britain's drinks sector, with more than £5bn in annual exports. In recent years, China has been one of its fastest-growing markets.Industry groups welcomed the move, saying it would help Scottish distillers compete in a crowded market where US, European and Japanese firms are also vying for customers.Another outcome of the trip was visa-free travel for British citizens visiting China for up to 30 days for holidays and business, putting the UK on par with around 50 other countries, including France, Germany, Australia and Japan.Both sides also agreed to cooperate on disrupting migrant-smuggling networks, a top priority for Sir Keir's government. For Beijing, renewed ties with the UK - a major European economy and close US ally - signal that China remains a dependable partner for the West despite Trump's trade tensions.Economically, the reset secures access for Chinese exporters of high-value goods such as electric vehicles, solar panels and clean energy, while creating opportunities for Chinese investment in British services, finance and green tech.Chinese state media framed the visit as a step toward turning the \"potential of China–UK cooperation into real achievements that benefit both peoples and the world\".British firms were also quick to emphasise the benefits for both countries through the expanded partnerships.\"The prime minister's visit, the first in eight years, is a significant moment, signalling the importance of the economic relationship between the UK and China,\" Chris Fitzgerald, group director for international affairs at Octopus Energy told the BBC from China.\"Such partnerships mean we can bring affordable, secure, clean energy to British customers... And we can use our technology and know-how to bring some of the same benefits to Chinese customers.\"What challenges remain?Foreign businesses have long complained about the difficulties of doing business in China, flagging red tape, complex regulations, and a lack of transparency.These can complicate investment decisions and create uncertainty for companies.\"Any market has its own challenges, so of course we've got to be clear eyed and seek expert advice,\" Fitzgerald said.\"We have had good discussions with the Chinese officials who have welcomed our entry. And we have been careful to choose an excellent partner... So we are excited to take the immense opportunity that the world's largest renewable energy market offers.\"Sir Keir's Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, making the China visit a high-stakes test.Despite scrutiny at home, improving relations with the world's second-largest economy has been a priority for the British prime minister.The move, however, requires a delicate diplomatic balancing act.US President Trump recently warned that Canada could face 100% tariffs over deals struck with China during Mark Carney's visit, and he has warned the UK about deepening its commercial ties with Beijing.Sir Keir has insisted that Britain does not need to choose between Washington and Beijing, framing the reset as a pragmatic way to support growth at home while managing geopolitical risk.At the UK–China Business Forum in Beijing on Friday, he described meetings with Xi as \"very warm\" and highlighted the significance of agreements on visa-free travel and whisky tariffs.These offer British firms \"really important access\" and are \"symbolic of what we're doing with the relationship\", he said. \"That is the way that we build the mutual trust and respect that is so important.\"Sir Keir's visit is one of a flurry of trips to Beijing, as leaders from France, Canada and Finland seek to hedge against an increasingly unpredictable United States.With Washington pursuing aggressive tariff policies and even making threats over Greenland, these so-called middle powers are looking to diversify trade and investment partners while securing new markets.At the same time, these countries will be watching closely the deals that the UK, Canada, France and others are striking with China.They will all need to remain competitive in attracting Chinese investment and accessing the world's second largest economy.",

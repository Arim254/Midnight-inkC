    "body": "An explosion has killed at least eight people and injured 18 others during Friday prayers inside a mosque in the Syrian city of Homs, the health ministry has said.Pictures from Syria's state-run news agency, Sana, show the inside of the Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque with black, scorched walls, smashed windows and blood on the carpet.Officials believe that an explosive was detonated inside the building, Sana reports, citing a security source. While authorities are still searching for the perpetrators, jihadist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah said it was behind the explosion.The mosque is in the Wadi al-Dhahab neighbourhood, where most people are part of the Alawite ethnoreligious group. Syria's Foreign Ministry condemned the \"terrorist crime\", writing in a statement on X that the \"cowardly act is a blatant assault on human and moral values\" designed to \"undermine the security and stability\" of the country.Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah, a Sunni extremist group, has said it carried out the attack in collaboration with another unidentified group, using explosives planted at the site.The group's vague origins and opaque affiliations, which came to prominence in June when it said it was behind a deadly church bombing in Damascus, have raised questions about its true links and authenticity. Some observers have speculated that it could be a front for Islamic State group (IS) given the similarity in their messaging and type of targets.The latest claim follows a months-long lull in Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah's claimed attacks, which have largely taken the form of alleged targeted killings of minorities and what the group describes as \"remnants\" of the former Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.The blast comes a year after Syrian rebel forces overthrew Assad, who is Alawite. The sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam whose members make up one of the country's biggest religious minorities.Since then, Syria has seen several waves of sectarian violence, with Alawites fearing reprisals and being subject to crackdowns. Assad fled to Russia, an ally of his regime, where he and his family have been given asylum.In March, security forces were accused of killing dozens of Alawites in the coastal province of Latakia, war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring ",

    "body": "Thailand carried out air strikes on a disputed border area with Cambodia on Friday, as officials from both sides continued talks to try to end fighting.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry accused Thailand of \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses and injuring several people.Fighting broke out again earlier this month after a fragile ceasefire in July halted five days of intense border clashes. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the hostilities resumed.Both countries have blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.Since then, fighting has spread to nearly every province along the 500-mile (800km) border.Cambodia's defence ministry said Friday's attacks were in the north-western Banteay Meanchey province. Up to 40 bombs were dropped by F-16 fighter jets, the ministry said in a Facebook post.Thailand said the action was aimed at controlling Nong Chan village, and was \"carried out efficiently and successfully\".It came as Thai and Cambodian negotiators held their third day of talks at a border checkpoint. Defence ministers from both sides are due to join the discussions on Saturday.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Friday that once both sides agreed to each other's conditions, a ceasefire agreement could be signed.\"I hope this time will be the last one we'd have to sign, so that peace can occur in the area,\" he said, \"[and] people can return to their homes.\"The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years.But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on 24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.",

    "body": "Tarique Rahman, the front-runner to be the next prime minister of Bangladesh, has returned to the country after 17 years in exile ahead of landmark general elections.The 60-year-old is the figurehead of the influential Zia family and the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. The party he leads, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is eyeing a return to power when Bangladesh goes to the polls in the new year.Rahman, who has lived in London since 2008, is expected to become the country's new leader if the BNP emerges as the largest party. Rahman's return comes in the wake of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year.He had been the subject of various criminal investigations launched while her Awami League party was in power but was cleared of all charges when her regime fell. Hasina is living in exile in India and her party is unlikely to be permitted to take part in the elections, which many view as among the most consequential in Bangladesh's history.Last month, Hasina was sentenced to death for her role in suppressing anti-government protests. According to UN investigators, up to 1,400 people died in the student-led unrest.Hasina, who was put on trial in absentia, has denied committing crimes against humanity. ",

    "body": "Turkish authorities say they have disrupted planned attacks on Christmas and New Year's events after detaining more than 100 suspected members of the so-called Islamic State group.Mass raids were carried out at 124 addresses across Istanbul, the city's chief prosecutor said, with firearms, ammunition and \"organisational documents\" seized.Officials said IS supporters had been actively planning attacks across Turkey this week, particularly against non-Muslims. Police detained 115 suspects but efforts are ongoing to trace a further 22, an official statement read.The prosecutor's office said the suspects were in contact with IS operatives outside Turkey. The announcement comes two days after Turkish intelligence agents carried out a raid against the group on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.A Turkish national who is alleged to have held a senior role with the IS wing operating in the region was detained and accused of planning attacks against civilians. Turkey's security services regularly target people with suspected links to IS.The country shares a 900km (560 mile) border with Syria, where the group continues to operate in parts of the country.Syria's president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has close ties to the Turkish government, has vowed to work with the US and Europe to root out surviving elements of IS. The US launched a wave of air strikes against the group's positions across Syria on Friday in response to the killing of three Americans.Two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed by IS gunmen during an ambush earlier this month.

The suspect was eventually shot and wounded by a civilian outside the city of Afula, according to police.Shimshon Mordechai, a 68-year-old man, was killed and a 16-year-old boy was hurt in Friday's ramming, officials said, while the stabbing victim was Aviv Maor, aged 18.A day before the attack, an Israeli reservist was fired after video emerged of him ramming a praying Palestinian with a quad bike. The suspect in the attack came from the village of Qabatiya, in the northern occupied West Bank, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.Following the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was preparing to carry out an operation in the Qabatiya area. Katz said he had instructed the IDF to act \"forcefully and immediately\". The IDF said the suspect had \"infiltrated into Israeli territory several days ago\".Israel's Kan News public broadcaster said the 37-year-old man had been working illegally in Israel and had used his employer's vehicle in the attack.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed \"deepest condolences\" to the victims' families.In a post on X, he also praised \"the heroic citizen who neutralised the terrorist\".The incident comes a day after the army reservist drove a quad bike into a Palestinian man who was praying on a roadside in the West Bank.Video shows the man, dressed in civilian clothes but with a firearm, ramming the victim with the vehicle. Reports say the victim was unhurt. The Israeli military said the soldier - who had earlier opened fire in a nearby village - had been fired and his weapon confiscated.Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians have surged in the West Bank in recent years, according to the United Nations, with more than a thousand killed since the Hamas attacks on Israel of 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.More than 70,600 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Additional reporting by Tom McArthur",

    "body": "The jailed ex-president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a successful surgery for a double hernia, his wife Michelle says. The former leader is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazil's Supreme Court granted permission for the 70-year-old to be transferred from the room in the federal police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to a hospital in the capital, Brasília, for the procedure. Ahead of the surgery, Jair Bolsonaro endorsed the candidacy of his eldest son, Flávio, for the 2026 presidential race. The former president made his decision known in handwritten letter that was read out by Flávio Bolsonaro outside the hospital were his father is being treated.\"During my life, I have fought tough battles, paying a high price with both my health and my family, to defend what I think is best for our country,\" Bolsonaro wrote.\"I hand over what is most important in the life of a father - my own son for the mission of rescuing our country, Brazil.\"Flávio Bolsonaro, a 44-year-old senator, had already announced his decision to run for president for his father's Liberal Party.Ealier this month, he said his father had entrusted him \"with the mission of continuing our national project\". But Jair Bolsonaro's letter, which has been published by Brazilian media, is confirmation the senator has his father's backing.The incumbent, President Lula, has already announced he plans to run again in the presidential election scheduled for October 2026. In 2022, the presidential election went into a run-off, which saw the older Bolsonaro take on ex-President Lula. When Lula narrowly won, Jair Bolsonaro refused to accept the result and plotted with top military leaders to prevent Lula from taking up office. While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023.Bolsonaro was found guilty of coup-plotting and sentenced in September this year. Despite the guilty verdict, the older Bolsonaro still wields considerable political influence.Brazil's Congress passed a bill last week to significantly shorten Bolsonaro's sentence but President Lula said he would veto it.  Jair Bolsonaro is expected to be transferred back to federal police headquarters as soon as doctors give the go-ahead. ",

    "body": "Pope Leo has urged Ukraine and Russia to find the \"courage\" to hold direct talks to end the war during his first Christmas remarks to crowds in St Peter's square.He called for an end to conflicts around the world during his Urbi et Orbi address, which is traditionally delivered by the pontiff on Christmas Day to worshippers gathered in Vatican City. Speaking about Ukraine, the Pope said: \"May the clamour of weapons cease, and may the parties involved, with the support and commitment of the international community, find the courage to engage in sincere, direct and respectful dialogue.\"His plea comes as US-led negotiations on a deal to end the fighting continues. The US has sought to put together an agreement acceptable to both sides, but direct talks between Russian and Ukraine have not taken place during this latest round of diplomatic efforts.Pope Leo also decried turmoil and conflict plaguing other parts of the world, including Thailand and Cambodia where deadly border clashes have flared up despite a ceasefire in July.He asked that the South East Asian nations' \"ancient friendship\" be restored and \"to work towards reconciliation and peace\".During an earlier Christmas Day sermon in St Peter's Basilica, Pope Leo lamented conditions for homeless people the world over, and the damage caused by conflicts.\"Fragile is the flesh of defenceless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds,\" he said.He said the story of the birth of Jesus showed that God had \"pitched his fragile tent\" among the people of the world. \"How, then,\" he asked, turning his attention to the conditions of Palestinians, \"can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?\"Gaza has been devastated by Israeli bombardment in a two-year war, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.Winter storms have compounded the plight of the territory's 2.1m population, nearly all of whom have been displaced and their homes damaged or destroyed.Aid agencies have called for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza. Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's border crossings, has dismissed claims of deliberate aid restrictions, saying almost 310,000 tents and tarpaulins had been delivered since the start of the ceasefire in October.",

    "body": "6 hours agoMadeline HalpertEric Thayer via Getty ImagesCars were buried in debris in Wrightwood, CaliforniaRainstorms are tapering off across southern California, but even modest additional rainfall could trigger floods and mudslides in saturated areas, forecasters warn.Officials say at least three people have died in the catastrophic flooding over the Christmas period.The storms - which continued into Friday - brought 6 inches (15 cm) of rainfall to Los Angeles County, with up to 18 inches recorded in the mountains, prompting evacuations and closing major roads.More than 50,000 people in the state are still without power as efforts to restore service continue on Friday.The US National Weather Service warned  on Friday  that \"the potential for flooding will be high\", though showers will taper off as the day goes on.\"Flood watches and advisories remain in effect as it won't take much additional rain to create flooding issues today, especially in the mountains where some areas have received close to 18 inches of rain since Tuesday,\" the NWS said in its latest forecast.The storms came from multiple atmospheric rivers - invisible ribbons of water vapour that form over oceans and transport huge amounts of moisture, bringing intense rainfall and snow - during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.Emergency responders have had to perform several rescues, including people stuck in vehicles as flood waters rose. On Wednesday morning, a 64-year-old man from San Diego was killed by a fallen tree, the police department told US media.Another person, a 74-year-old, died from flood waters over the weekend as police tried to rescue him from inside a vehicle in Redding, the town's mayor told local news.Watch: Powerful storm batters southern CaliforniaAnd on Monday, a woman in her 70s died after she \"was knocked off a rock by a large wave and swept into the ocean\" at MacKerricher State Park in Mendocino County, the sheriff's office said.In a statement on Thursday night, Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said that a limited number of evacuation orders remained in effect.Friday's rain is expected to be lighter and briefer than the earlier waves, with improving conditions anticipated by the evening,\"Our overall picture is that there's just one more day of this mess, mostly across Southern California, specifically in the LA area,\" Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, told Reuters on Friday. \"We still have some issues today with bouts of heavy rain, but this weekend is mainly dry, thankfully.\"Heavy rain threatens US west coast",

    "body": "Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been jailed for 15 years for abuse of power and money laundering, in his second major trial for a multi-billion-dollar state funds scandal.Najib, 72, was accused of misappropriating nearly 2.3 billion Malaysian ringgit ($569m; £422m) from the nation's sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).On Friday afternoon a judge found him guilty in four charges of abuse of power and  21 charges of money laundering. The former PM is already in jail after he was convicted years ago in another case related to 1MDB.Friday's verdict comes after seven years of legal proceedings, which saw 76 witnesses called to the stand.The verdict, delivered in Malaysia's administrative capital Putrajaya, is the second blow in the same week to the embattled former leader, who has been imprisoned since 2022.He was handed four 15-year sentences on abuse of power charges, as well as five years each on 21 money laundering charges. The jail terms run concurrently under Malaysian law. On Monday, the court rejected his application to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. But the former prime minister retains a loyal base of supporters, who claim that he's a victim of unfair rulings and who have showed up at his trials calling for his release.On Friday, dozens of people gathered outside the court in Putrajaya in support of Najib.The 1MDB scandal made headlines across the world when it came to light a decade ago, embroiling prominent figures from Malaysia to Goldman Sachs and Hollywood.Investigators estimated that $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private pockets, including Najib's.Najib's lawyers claim that he had been misled by his advisers - in particular the financier Jho Low, who has maintained his innocence but remains at large.But the argument has not convinced Malaysia's courts, which previously found Najib guilty of embezzlement in 2020.That year, Najib was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust over 42 million ringgit ($10m; £7.7m) transferred from SRC International - a former unit of 1MDB - into his private accounts.He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but saw his jail term halved last year.The latest case concerns a larger sum of money, also tied to 1MDB, received by his personal bank account in 2013. Najib said he had believed the money was a donation from the late Saudi King Abdullah - a claim rejected by the judge on Friday.Separately Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, was sentenced to ten years in jail in 2022 for bribery. She is free on bail pending an appeal against her conviction.The scandal has had profound repercussions on Malaysian politics. In 2018 it led to a historic election loss for Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition, which had governed the country since its independence in 1957.Now, the recent verdicts has highlighted fissures in Malaysia's ruling coalition, which includes Najib's party United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).Najib's failed house arrest bid on Monday was met with disappointment from his allies but celebrated by his critics within the same coalition.Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim called for politicians on all sides to respect the court's decisions.Former Malaysian lawmaker Tony Pua told the BBC's Newsday programme that the verdict would \"send a message\" to the country's leaders, that \"you can get caught for corruption even if you're number one in the country like the prime minister\".But Cynthia Gabriel,  founding director of Malaysia's Center to Combat Corruption and Cronyism, argued that the country has made little headway in anti-corruption efforts despite the years of reckoning after the 1MDB scandal.Public institutions have not been strengthened enough to reassure Malaysians that \"the politicians they put into power would actually serve their interests\" instead of \"their own pockets\", she told Newsday.\"Grand corruption continues in different forms\", she added. \"We don't know at all if another 1MDB could occur, or may have already occurred.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA US judge has temporarily blocked the detention of British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed, who took legal action against the US government over having his visa removed.The Center for Countering Digital Hate founder was among five people denied US visas after the Trump administration accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" tech platforms into censoring free speech.The move brought a backlash from European leaders defending the work of organisations monitoring online content.Mr Ahmed, a US permanent resident, had warned that being detained and possibly deported would tear him away from his American wife and child. Praising the judge's decision, he told BBC News he would not be \"bullied\".Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said online that the individuals were blocked over concerns that they had organised efforts to pressure US platforms to censor and \"punish American viewpoints they oppose\".Mr Ahmed filed a legal complaint on Wednesday against officials including Rubio and US Attorney General Pamela Bondi over the decision to have him sanctioned.In court documents seen by the BBC, US District Judge Vernon S Broderick said on Thursday he had granted Mr Ahmed's request for a temporary restraining order.The judge also temporarily blocked the officials from detaining Mr Ahmed without the chance for his case to be heard.The BBC has contacted the state department and White House for comment.When approached by AFP news agency, a state department spokesperson was quoted as saying: \"The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here.\"Mr Ahmed said: \"I will not be bullied away from my life's work of fighting to keep children safe from social media's harm and stopping antisemitism online.\"His lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said the speed of the judge's decision was telling. \"The federal government can't deport a green card holder like Imran Ahmed, with a wife and young child who are American, simply because it doesn't like what he has to say,\" she said.In 2023, Mr Ahmed's centre was sued by Elon Musk's social media company after it reported on a rise in hate speech on the platform since the billionaire's takeover of the firm, now called X.The case was dismissed but an appeal is pending. Speaking to the BBC News Channel on Friday evening, Mr Ahmed said: \"We were sued by Elon Musk a couple of years ago, unsuccessfully; a court found that he was trying to impinge on our First Amendment rights to free speech by using law to try and silence our accountability work.\"Mr Ahmed said the last few days have been \"rather confusing\". He said the Center for Countering Digital Hate \"has worked with administrations both Republican and Democrat\" and feels he is now being targeted because the organisations his group researches do not like being called out.\"This does seem to be...  perhaps even an error, goaded on by some of the tech companies, the social media platforms, the AI platforms that the Center for Countering Digital Hate studies and holds accountable\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoTom McArthurandAbdirahman Ali DhimbilGetty ImagesSomaliland's president Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi called the declaration \"historic\"Israel has become the first country to formally recognise Somalia's breakaway region of Somaliland as an independent nation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel intended to immediately expand cooperation in agriculture, health, and technology. Somaliland's president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, called the development \"a historic moment\".Recognition by Israel could encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing the region's diplomatic credentials and access to international markets.Somalia's prime minister, Hamza Abdi Barre, said his country categorically and unequivocally rejected what he called a deliberate attack by Israel on its sovereignty.Abdullahi said in a statement that Somaliland would join the Abraham Accords, in what he called a step toward regional and global peace.Somaliland was committed to building partnerships, boosting mutual prosperity and promoting stability across the Middle East and Africa, he added.The decision has been condemned by the foreign ministers of Somalia, Egypt, Turkey and Djibouti, who in a statement affirmed their \"total rejection\" of Israel's announcement.The two countries had agreed to establish \"full diplomatic ties, which will include the appointment of ambassadors and the opening of embassies\", Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said in a statement on X.\"I have instructed my ministry to act immediately to institutionalise ties between the two countries across a wide range of fields,\" he said.Meanwhile, Egypt's foreign minister held separate phone calls with his counterparts in Somalia, Turkey and Djibouti to discuss issues including Israel's declaration.In a statement, Egypt's foreign ministry said the four countries reaffirmed their support for Somalia's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and warned against unilateral steps that could undermine stability or create what they called \"parallel entities\" to Somalia's state institutions.They also argued that recognising the independence of parts of sovereign states would set a dangerous precedent under international law and the United Nations Charter. The statement added that the ministers reiterated their rejection of any plans to displace Palestinians outside their homeland.Israel has for years been trying to bolster relations with countries in the Middle East and Africa, but recent wars including in Gaza and against Iran have been seen as a hindrance to democracy.Historic deals struck late in Trump's first term in 2020, known as the Abraham Accords, saw several countries including Muslim-majority United Arab Emirates and Morocco normalise relations with Israel, with other countries joining later. Somaliland has a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden, and has its own money, passports and police force. Born in 1991 after a war of independence against former dictator General Siad Barre, it has grappled with decades of isolation ever since.With a population of almost six million, the self-proclaimed republic has recently been at the centre of several regional disputes involving Somalia, Ethiopia and Egypt.Last year, an agreement between landlocked Ethiopia and Somaliland to lease a stretch of coastline for a port and military base angered Somalia.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJaroslav LukivandMakuochi OkaforBBCOne strike hit a field near a village in Sokoto stateThe US has launched strikes against militants linked to the Islamic State group (IS) in north-western Nigeria, where militants have sought to establish a foothold. Camps run by the group in Sokoto state were hit near the border with Niger, the US military said. Casualty numbers are unclear, but both US and Nigerian officials say militants were killed.US President Donald Trump said the Christmas Day strikes had been \"deadly\" and labelled the group \"terrorist scum\", saying they had been \"targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians\".Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC it was a \"joint operation\" and had \"nothing to do with a particular religion\".Tuggar said the strikes had been planned \"for quite some time\" using intelligence provided by Nigeria. He also did not rule out further strikes. Referencing the timing of strikes - which took place late on Thursday - he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas\".The US military said an \"initial assessment\" suggested \"multiple\" fatalities in Sokoto state.A local official in the Tangaza area of Sokoto state, Isa Salihu Bashir, told the BBC the strikes had \"hit some Lakurawa terrorist camps\". He said many fighters had been killed but the death toll was unclear.The BBC has been unable to independently confirm casualty figures.Bashir added that border patrols on the Niger side reported seeing Lakurawa fighters fleeing the targeted areas.The Nigerian government has long been fighting an array of jihadist groups, including Boko Haram and IS-linked factions, but largely in the north-east. But in recent years a smaller group - known locally as Lakurawa - has sought to establish a base in north-western Sokoto state.Nigerian authorities say the group has links to jihadist networks in Mali and Niger. They add that its members have settled in border communities, recruited young people, and imposed harsh controls.Tangaza is made up of remote villages, whose residents are mostly moderate practising Muslims. In a statement late on Friday, Nigeria's information ministry said \"precision strike operations\" had been carried with the \"explicit approval\" of President Bola Tinubu and with \"the full involvement of the armed forces of Nigeria\".It also said that during the operation debris from munitions fell in two communities – the village of Jabo, also in Sokoto state, and Offa in Kwara state, about 600km (370 miles) to the south. No civilian casualties were reported in either location.An eyewitness in Jabo, Umar Jabo told the BBC: \"Something that looked like a plane flashed and crashed... in fields.\" He said there was no issue with IS in the area: \"We live peacefully, and there is no conflict between us and Christians.\"The Trump administration has previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks and has claimed a \"genocide\" is being perpetrated.Trump has labelled Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\", a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".The US military was ordered to prepare to intervene in Nigeria in November.US Department of DefenseThe US defence department posted a short video that appears to show a missile being launched from a military vesselIn a social media post late on Christmas Day confirming the strikes, Trump said that he would \"not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\". The Pentagon later posted a short video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a ship.Militants allied to IS have sought to establish a presence in two north-western states, while a separate IS-linked group has a stronghold in north-eastern BornoNigeria is Africa's most populous country, with about 220 million people, divided roughly evenly between Christians and Muslims.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and IS-linked offshoots have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people.Most victims have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group that analyses political violence around the world.The strikes are the second major US intervention targeting IS in recent weeks.Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria.US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery had struck more than 70 targets. Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.Those strikes were launched in retaliation for the killing of three Americans - two soldiers and a civilian interpreter - in an ambush. ",

    "body": "1 day agoNikita Yadav AFP via Getty ImagesIndia gets plenty of sunlight throughout the year, which makes solar power highly efficientIndia's rapid solar energy expansion is widely hailed as a success. But without a plan to manage the waste it will generate, how clean is the transition?In just over a decade, India has become the world's third-largest solar producer, with renewables now central to its climate strategy. Solar panels are everywhere - from vast solar parks to blue rooftops across cities, towns and villages.Alongside large solar parks, millions of rooftop systems now feed power into the electricity grid. Government data show nearly 2.4 million households have adopted solar under a subsidy scheme.Solar growth has cut India's reliance on coal. Though thermal and other non-renewables still supply over half of installed capacity, solar now contributes more than 20%. Yet the achievement carries a challenge: while clean in use, solar panels can pose environmental risks if not properly managed.Solar panels are mostly recyclable, made of glass, aluminium, silver, and polymers - but trace toxic metals like lead and cadmium can pollute soil and water if mishandled.Solar panels typically last about 25 years, after which they are removed and discarded. India currently has no dedicated budget for solar-waste recycling and only a few small facilities to process old panels.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThermal power plants continue to dominate India's energy generation capacityIndia has no official data on solar waste, but a study estimated around 100,000 tonnes by 2023, rising to 600,000 tonnes by 2030. For now, the volume is small, but experts warn the bulk is yet to come - and without rapid recycling investment, India could face a growing waste crisis.A new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) estimates that India could generate more than 11 million tonnes of solar waste by 2047. Managing this would require almost 300 dedicated recycling facilities and an investment of $478 (£362m) over the next two decades.\"Most of India's large solar parks were built in the mid-2010s, so the real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,\" says Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray.India's solar-waste projections mirror global patterns: the US may generate 170,000–1 million tonnes and China nearly one million tonnes by 2030, following rapid solar expansion in the 2010s.The policy landscape, however, differs significantly.In the US, solar-panel recycling is mostly market-driven under a patchwork of state rules. China's system, like India's, is still developing and lacks a dedicated regulatory framework.In 2022, India brought solar panels under e-waste rules, making manufacturers responsible for collecting, storing, dismantling and recycling them at end of life.Experts say enforcement is uneven, especially for home and small-scale panels, which make up 5–10% of installations. Though modest, these panels can still generate substantial waste, as they are harder to track, collect, and recycle.Damaged or discarded panels often end up in landfills or with unauthorised recyclers, where unsafe methods can release toxic materials. The BBC has contacted India's renewable energy ministry for comment.Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesDamaged and ageing rooftop panels are rarely recycled\"Solar power gives an illusion of clean energy for two decades, but without a serious plan for recycling panels it risks leaving behind a graveyard of modules and not much of a legacy,\" says environment expert Sai Bhaskar Reddy Nakka.Despite the challenges, experts say the problem is not without opportunities.  \"As waste rises, so will the demand for companies that know how to process it,\" Mr Pahwa says. Efficient recycling could reclaim 38% of materials for new panels by 2047 and prevent 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions from mining, says CEEW.India already has markets for glass and aluminium, and metals found in solar cells - silicon, silver, and copper - can be recovered for new panels or other industries, says Akansha Tyagi, co-author of the study.Currently, most solar waste is processed with basic methods that recover only low-value materials like glass and aluminium, while precious metals are lost, damaged or extracted in tiny amounts.Experts say the next decade will be decisive for India's solar goals. The country must act fast - building a regulated, self-sustaining recycling system, raising household awareness, and integrating waste collection into solar business models.Companies that profit from solar power should also be responsible for what happens to panels once they stop working, says Mr Nakka. \"Without proper recycling, clean energy today could mean more waste tomorrow,\" he warned.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "Zelensky plans to meet Trump on Sunday for talks on ending Russian war3 hours agoSean SeddonEPA/ShutterstockUkraine's president last met President Donald Trump at the White House in OctoberUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida at the weekend, as talks continue on ending Russia's full-scale war.Zelensky said he expected the meeting to take place on Sunday and to focus on a US-brokered 20-point peace plan, as well as separate proposals for US security guarantees.However, in a sign of the gulf between Moscow and Kyiv, a senior Russian official said that plan was \"radically different\" to the one it was negotiating with Washington.Russia has spoken of \"slow but steady progress\" in talks but has not commented on Zelensky's offer to withdraw troops from the eastern Donbas, if Russia pulls back too.Ukraine has sought to secure guarantees from the US as part of a deal, and Zelensky has suggested that a demilitarised \"free economic zone\" is a potential option for areas of Donbas that Russia has failed to take by force.On Friday, Zelensky told reporters that the 20-point plan was 90% complete: \"Our task is to make sure everything is 100% ready.\"He wrote on social media: \"We are not losing a single day. We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the new year.\"But in an interview with Politico published on Friday, Trump said his Ukrainian counterpart \"doesn't have anything until I approve it\".\"I think it's going to go good with him. I think it's going to go good with [Vladimir] Putin,\" Trump said.He also said he expects to speak with the Russian leader \"soon\".Trump also told Politico that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would visit him in the coming days.Putin's senior aides have held further talks with US officials over the phone, after Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev returned from a meeting in Florida last weekend.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov was positive about latest developments, but accused Ukraine of trying to \"torpedo\" talks on the US plan.\"I think December 25, 2025, will remain in all our memories as a milestone when we truly came close to a solution. But whether we can make the final push and reach an agreement depends on our work and the political will of the other side,\" he said in comments to Russian state TV on Friday.Shortly after details of Zelensky's imminent visit to Florida emerged, the mayor of Ukraine's major northeastern city, Kharkiv, said two people had been killed and several others wounded in a Russian air strike.ReutersUkrainian soldiers were pictured eating a Christmas meal together as fighting continued along the front line Zelensky has met Trump several times this year, since an initial White House meeting in February descended into a hostile shouting match. Their most recent meeting at the White House in October was far more amicable.Confirmation of planned top-level talks came after the Ukrainian leader said he had spoken to Trump's chief negotiators, special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, for an hour over the phone on Christmas Day.He said the latest round of negotiations had generated \"new ideas\" on how to end the war, and described it as a \"really good conversation\". The White House has proposed establishing what would in effect be a demilitarised zone in eastern Ukraine where both sides agree not to deploy troops - a compromise that would avoid settling the intractable question of legal ownership over the contested territory. Zelensky signalled on Wednesday that if Ukraine were to pull back by up to 40km (25 miles) from the front line in the east to create an economic zone, then Russia would have to do the same from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine's industrial heartland in the Donbas.Ukraine has secured a number of changes to an earlier 28-point draft plan, which was formulated by Steve Witkoff but widely seen as being favourable to Russia.Zelensky told reporters on Friday that the weekend talks in Florida would focus on several documents, including US security guarantees and a separate economic agreement.However, Zelensky has repeatedly said the question of territory has proved to be the most difficult issue to resolve, along with the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.The White House has proposed Ukraine and Russia split the energy generated by the plant, the largest in Europe. Russian troops currently control it.Russia is unlikely to agree to a number of points in the updated US plan, especially its territorial proposals. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused \"groups of states, primarily Western European\" of seeking to derail the diplomatic progress that had been made.Putin has demanded full control of Donbas, including 25% of the Donetsk region that it has not occupied.Zelensky outlined the latest version of the plan this week, the first time since the original 28-point draft was leaked in November.Latest proposals commit the US and Europe to providing security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5, committing allies to providing military support in the event Russia launches a renewed invasion. The deal would also see Ukraine's military maintained at 800,000 personnel, a level the Kremlin has demanded be cut.Meanwhile, fighting and aerial strikes have continued, with casualties in the central city of Uman as well as Ukraine's second biggest city Kharkiv.Ukraine's air force said on Friday it had shot down 73 drones overnight.Russia also said it had shot down Ukrainian drones and missiles, including British Storm Shadows. Ukraine's air force said it had struck oil and gas refineries in Rostov and Krasnodar. ",

Zattara, who has been held in detention awaiting trial since 2021, has admitted 10 rape charges.The trial is being held behind closed doors in the city of Aix-en-Provence at the request of one of the alleged victims, and is due to last at least two weeks. Others had sought open proceedings, saying they wanted their voices to be heard by as many people as possible. Zattara would allegedly slip sleeping pills into women's drinks before sexually assaulting them, a police investigation found. He allegedly often targeted women he was friends with or in intimate relationships with. Investigators found photos and videos on Zattara's computer that showed the alleged victims in a lethargic state during sex.One woman, who filed a complaint against the defendant in 2019 after attending one of his hypnosis sessions, said she had drunk some wine he had offered her and later woke up, recalling in fragments that she had been raped by Zattara and that she had been vomiting.His DNA was found under her fingernails and on her underwear, while toxicology results showed powerful sleep-inducing drugs in her system.The Zattara trial follows the high-profile case of Dominique Pelicot, who was jailed for 20 years after drugging and raping his ex-wife Gisèle and inviting dozens of strangers to also abuse her over nearly a decade.If you have been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "Just nowOlivia IrelandWatch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor saysThe Swiss bar that was the scene of a fire which killed 40 people and injured 116 had not undergone safety checks for five years, authorities have said.The mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, told a Tuesday news conference that he could not explain why Le Constellation bar had not been checked in so long, but that the council was \"profoundly sorry\". The venues should have been checked annually.\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019.Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: \"I have no answer for you today.\"\"We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families.\" \"I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to,\" he later added. Feraud said it would be \"down to the judges\" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors.ReutersPeople in the area have been leaving tributes to the victims of the deadly New Year's Day fireWhen the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate.Feraud said the maximum capacity was 200 people, with emergency exits designed to cater for 100 people on each side of its two levels. However he did not know if the exit on the basement level was working.Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers under criminal investigation, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said.Prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar. Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. Swiss national broadcaster RTS has shown footage from 2019 of partygoers holding bottles with sparklers. An employee warns them to be careful of the \"mousse\" - the French word for the acoustics foam panelling. Questioned on the video, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images and he wished it had been brought to his attention at the time as he would have investigated. More on this storyFeraud said while inspections of the facility were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2019, there were none from 2020 to 2025. He told the press conference in 2015 the owners renovated the bar and it did not require a permit, which was when the sound insulation foam was stuck on the ceiling. \"There were never any checks on this soundproofing foam. Our security agents did not consider it necessary,\" Feraud said. Investigators will be assessing several elements, including the nature of the foam, compliance with standards for access and emergency exits in the basement. Accounts from reported scenes include that people pushed and shoved, notably on the staircase leading to the basement. Under Swiss regulations, doors are required to open in the direction of the exit and be clearly signposted. Under Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities. The Crans-Montana's failure to adhere to fire safety regulations by not inspecting Le  Constellation from 2020 to 2025 may point to a potential fault with the system. ",

    "body": "6 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondentNvidia has unveiled a new tech platform for self-driving cars as the world's leading chip-maker seeks more physical products to embed AI into.Speaking at the annual CES technology conference in Las Vegas, boss Jensen Huan said the system - called Alpamayo - would bring \"reasoning\" to autonomous vehicles.That would allow cars to \"think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,\" Huang claimed.He said Nvidia was working with Mercedes to produce a driverless car powered by the tech, which would be released in the US in the coming months before being rolled out in Europe and Asia.Nvidia's chips have helped power the AI revolution, though so far attention has mostly been focussed on the software it powers, such as ChatGPT.However, leading tech firms are now increasingly looking for hardware - meaning physical products such as cars - that AI could be used in.Wearing his trademark black leather jacket, Huang told an audience of hundreds that the project has taught Nvidia \"an enormous amount\" about how to help partners build robotic systems. \"The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is almost here,\" Huang said.\"NVIDIA's pivot toward AI at scale and AI systems as differentiators will help keep it way ahead of rivals,\" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, from Las Vegas.\"Alpamayo represents a profound shift for NVIDIA, moving from being primarily a compute to a platform provider for physical AI ecosystems.\"Shares of the AI chip designer rose slightly in after-hours trading following Huang's presentation.It featured a video demonstration of the AI-powered Mercedes-Benz driving through San Francisco while a passenger, sat behind the steering wheel, kept their hands in their lap.\"It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,\" Huang said, \"but in every single scenario... it tells you what it's going to do, and it reasons about what it's about to do.\"Alpamayo is an open-source AI model, with the underlying code now available on machine learning platform Hugging Face, where autonomous vehicle researchers can access it for free and retrain the model, Huang said. \"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" he told the audience.The project could pose a threat to companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, which offers driver assistance software called Autopilot.\"Well that's just exactly what Tesla is doing,\" Musk posted on social media following the Alpamayo announcement. \"What they will find is that it's easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.\"Like Tesla, Nvidia also has plans to launch a robotaxi service by next year in collaboration with a partner, but has declined to name the partner or say where it will be.Nvidia is the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of more than $4.5tn (£3.3tn). It became the first company to reach $5tn in October, but has lost value over concerns about whether demand AI is overhyped.The company also revealed that its Rubin AI chips are currently being manufactured and are due for release later this year.The highly-anticipated hardware can compute using less energy than Nvidia's current line of AI chips, and could drive down the cost of developing the technology.",

    "body": "Tomorrowland, the hugely popular European electronic dance music or EDM festival, will stage its first-ever full-fledged Asia edition in Thailand this December.Thailand was chosen for its \"growing influence on the global stage of music, innovation, and experience-driven tourism\", Tomorrowland said on Tuesday.Founded 20 years ago by Belgian brothers Manu and Michiel Beers, Tomorrowland has become one of the world's most iconic celebrations of EDM. Its annual Belgian edition often features ambitious, creative stages and wild parties that draw music lovers from across the world.Organisers are expecting more than 50,000 attendees each day in the Thai beach town Pattaya from 11 to 13 December. Pre-registration for tickets begins on 8 January. A \"full madness pass\" covering all three days of the festival will cost 12,500 baht ($400; £300) while a single-day pass is going at 5,100 baht.More details on the festival's theme and line-up will follow soon, organisers said. Although the Tomorrowland group has held events in some Asian cities, this is the first time it will be holding an entire festival in the continent, and one that is similar to the scale of what it does in Belgium.  Thailand finalised an agreement with Tomorrowland to host the event for five years and expects it to generate 21bn baht ($673m; £497m) over the period, Thai media reported.\"Expanding Tomorrowland to a new continent is a milestone we approach with great respect and excitement... This is the beginning of a long-term story,\" said Tomorrowland's chief executive officer Bruno Vanwelsenaers.In recent years, Thailand has become a strong contender in the live music scene. Last year, it played host to international music festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival and Creamfields. Bangkok was also a stop on K-pop band Blackpink's world tour last October. And the country's homegrown music and arts festival Wonderfruit is emerging as a hot destination on the festival circuit, drawing tens of thousands of people each year.",

    "body": "Canada's former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland has said she will leave parliament to accept a job as adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Freeland said her role as an economic development adviser for Ukraine would be unpaid. In July, she will also take on a position to lead the Rhodes Trust, an educational charity, in the UK. She was elected in 2013, and served in key roles such finance, foreign affairs and international trade minister under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.She broke from Trudeau in late 2024, accusing him in a public resignation letter of failing to take the threat of US tariffs seriously, which helped force his political exit.Freeland posted on X on Monday: \"Ukraine is at the forefront of today's global fight for democracy, and I welcome this chance to contribute on an unpaid basis as an economic adviser to [Zelensky].\"In the coming weeks I will also leave my seat in Parliament. I want to thank my constituents for their years of confidence in me. I am so grateful to have been your representative.\"As well as stepping down as an MP for Toronto's riding of University-Rosedale, a Liberal safe seat, she said she would quit her other role as Canada's special representative for the reconstruction of Ukraine.Earlier on Monday, Zelensky announced on X that Freeland would be taking on the role as adviser.The Ukrainian president said she had \"extensive experience in attracting investment and implementing economic transformations\". Zelensky's announcement had spurred calls from opposition politicians for her to step down.Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said \"one cannot be a Canadian MP and an adviser to a foreign government\".  \"She must do one or the other,\" he added.In November it was announced that this summer Freeland would become CEO of the Rhodes Trust, which administers Rhodes scholarships to Oxford University.In September, she stepped down as Carney's minister of transport and internal trade to take on the new role as Canada's special envoy to Ukraine, and announced she would not be running in the next federal election. A former journalist who is of Ukrainian heritage, Freeland has long been a vocal supporter of Kyiv in its war with Russia. In 2014, she was placed on a Kremlin list of Westerners banned from entering Russia in retaliation for sanctions against Moscow.In 2020, Freeland became the first woman to be appointed as finance minister in Canada's history, where she managed Canada's financial response to the Covid pandemic.She is also credited with helping renegotiate the current free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico during President Donald Trump's first term in 2018. Trump later called her \"toxic\".The USMCA trade deal - or CUSMA in Canada - has been credited with helping the country largely avoid a stiff 35% tariff rate imposed by Trump, who granted Canada an exemption for goods covered by the free trade agreement.That deal is now up for another round of renegotiations this year.

    "body": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has reshuffled the leadership of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), replacing influential Vasyl Malyuk and nominating Maj-Gen Yevhenii Khmara as acting head.The SBU is primarily concerned with internal security and counter-intelligence and, since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, it has also played a prominent role in assassinations and sabotage attacks deep inside Russia.Malyuk, who had run the SBU since 2022, gained a reputation for overseeing successful operations against Russia and for purging the SBU from alleged Russian double agents.The latest reshuffles are the latest in a long series made by Zelensky since the start of the war.Malyuk's name is known across Ukraine. After all, last June he co-ordinated the daring \"Spider Web\" attack, which saw more than 100 Ukrainian drones struck air bases deep inside Russian territory. Khmara, his replacement, was also involved in the preparation of that operation.So it did not come as a surprise that Malyuk's dismissal earlier this week was widely criticised within Ukraine, including by several high-profile military commanders. The impression that the decision made by President Zelensky was short-sighted was cemented by reports that Malyuk had initially refused to step down voluntarily.Although he has been dismissed from the position of SBU chief, he has been asked  to continue leading special operations against Russia. Ukraine needed more \"asymmetric operations against Russian forces\", Zelensky said, adding that Malyuk was \"best at this\".Khmara's appointment has gone some way in quelling fears about the SBU's future effectiveness. But former SBU operative Ivan Stupak argues his reputation - though solid - is limited to a certain sphere and that it is unclear whether he will be able to translate his experience to running the wider SBU.Stupak also believes that Malyuk's dismissal is connected with the appointment of former spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as Zelensky's new chief of staff.\"Malyuk and Budanov are at loggerheads,\" he told the BBC, implying that Budanov had heavily influenced Zelensky's decision and that Khmara would now be \"in the hands\" of Budanov.Other analysts disagree. Oleksandr Notevskyi, political analyst for Ukrainian media outlet Grunt, praised Khmara's appointment, pointing out his successes in heading Alpha, one of the top elite divisions of the SBU: \"He's young, he's experienced, he is one of the authors of the Spider Web operation.\"In a statement, the SBU described Khmara as a decorated and \"experienced special-purpose officer\" who was involved in liberating the Kyiv region in 2022 and fighting the Russians in the occupied region of Donetsk.Khmara's appointment will need to be confirmed by the Ukrainian parliament, which may yet reject it. Other options are on the table, Notevskyi said. After nearly four years of war, Ukraine is struggling to push back Russian forces in the conventional way - on the battlefield and along the long front line in the east of the country. It has had more success targeting oil fields, weapons factories and - as in the case of the Spider Web attack - air bases and valuable aircraft.At this particular juncture of the war with Moscow, Notevskyi argued, \"whoever leads the security service should be someone who is specialised in eliminating Russia's military capacities on the territory of Russia\". Last week, Zelensky announced significant changes to his top team. Mikhaylo Fedorov was nominated as new defence minister, while foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko replaced Budanov. Many of Zelensky's reshuffles have been criticised by commentators as damaging to the country at a time of crisis. Using a football analogy, Stupak argued that Zelensky was like a manager going to the substitute bench for replacements. \"But his bench is quite short, and he's running out of people to use again and again,\" he said.Additional reporting by Volodymyr Lozhko and Anastasiia Levchenko",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaulin KolaEPARussia has intensified attacks - particularly against Ukraine's energy sectorFrench President Emmanuel Macron is hosting Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky and other key allies of the country as efforts intensify to agree security guarantees for Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.Heads of state and top officials from more than 30 countries - part of the so-called Coalition of the Willing - are meeting in Paris, including US mediators in peace talks Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Zelensky met Trump recently and said his plan to end the war with Russia was 90% agreed.However, the proposals have yet to be presented to Russia, whose response so far has been far from encouraging.The outstanding 10% of the agreement that's yet to be decided concerns territorial concessions Kyiv is being asked to agree to.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress on the ground recently and, therefore, is unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas.Russia has also consistently opposed any idea of a temporary ceasefire and has intensified its attacks in Ukraine, particularly aimed at paralysing its power supplies in the middle of a harsh winter.Ukraine has also hit back with drones - the latest target being an oil depot in the Lipetsk region of western Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte are among the participants at the Paris meeting. Leaders are expected to seek agreement on details that include a multi-national force to reassure Ukraine after a peace deal, what security guarantees to offer Ukraine in the event of a renewed Russian attack - as well as helping Ukraine's armed forces and its economy.For months, the so-called \"backstop\" has been on the agenda - the desire among Ukraine's European allies to secure a pledge from the US that it will be involved in responding to Russia should it violate the terms of a peace deal.Following talks between Zelensky and Trump in Florida last month, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.The talks in Paris are being overshadowed by the aftermath of the US's military action in Venezuela, where elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York.Following the raid, Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time.He also said the US was returning to last century's policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. Looming larger over the Paris talks is Trump's subsequent insistence that the US wants to annex Greenland - the semi-autonomous territory that is part of Denmark, a Nato ally.The repeated threat prompted Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to say any such move from the US would be the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance. European leaders have been reluctant to criticise Trump's intervention in Venezuela and its perceived implications for the world order.But many, including Starmer and Macron, have sided with Denmark over Greenland.As host of the talks, Macron will be keen not to have the issue derail the focus on Ukraine.",

    "body": "7 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC Correspondent, DelhiThe survivor of a gang rape in the northern Indian state of Haryana has been discharged from hospital a week after her horrific assault, a police official told the BBC.The 26-year-old mother-of-two was taken to hospital in Faridabad city on the morning of 30 December with serious head and facial injuries and several fractures.Her sister said she was out visiting a friend and was waiting for transport just after midnight when two men in an ambulance offered her a lift. They drove her to a deserted place where they raped her and then threw her out of the speeding vehicle.A police spokesman said they had acted swiftly and arrested the two men and seized the vehicle.The woman was discharged by the hospital on Monday night following treatment and surgeries.Senior police official Mukesh Kumar told the BBC that they have approached the court to allow her to visit the prison for an \"identification parade\". Once the court order comes, she would be asked to pick out the two suspects from a crowd of men.The police said the crime took place on the intervening night of 29th and 30th December.\"The incident took place between 12.30 and 02:00. One stood outside the van and kept an eye on the surroundings while the other raped the woman inside the van,\" Yashpal Yadav, public relations officer of Faridabad police, said.Police had questioned the suspects, who were later produced in court and sent to prison, he added.A doctor at the hospital where the survivor was treated had said that the woman was brought in \"at around 05:30 on 30 December... she had a lot of injuries\".Shalini Chopra, a social worker and an opposition politician, who spoke to the survivor after she was discharged from the hospital told the BBC that the woman was \"better but still in pain\".The case has provoked anger and outrage in India and drawn comparisons with the horrific gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi in December 2012.Delhi Nirbhaya rape death penalty: What do hangings mean for India's women?Hyderabad case: Why Indians are celebrating the killingsWas Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment?That crime had made global headlines, led to huge protests in Delhi and several other cities and forced the government to introduce tough new anti-rape laws that included the death penalty for the most gruesome attacks.Four men convicted of the gang-rape and murder were hanged in 2020. One of the rapists died in prison while a juvenile was freed after spending time in a reform centre. But despite the heightened scrutiny of sexual crimes since then, tens of thousands of rapes and sexual assaults continue to be reported every year.According to latest police records, 29,670 rapes and 2,796 attempted rapes were reported in 2023. In addition, police also recorded 849 cases of child rapes and 94 cases of attempted rapes of children.",

    "body": "At least 22 migrants have been killed and 65 others injured after a lorry they were travelling in overturned in Ethiopia's north-eastern Afar region, authorities say.About 85 Ethiopian migrants were travelling along the eastern migration route when the lorry overturned in the town of Semera on Tuesday morning, a senior Afar official Mohammed Ali Biedo said in a statement.Their final destination was unclear but the route typically runs from Ethiopia through Djibouti, across the Red Sea to Yemen, and onward to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries.Yemen is a major pathway for migrants from the Horn of Africa travelling to Gulf states in search of work. Biedo said that 30 of the injured are in a critical condition.\"The accident occurred when a lorry transporting migrants, misled by illegal brokers and unaware of the dangers of their journey, overturned,\" Biedo said in the statement. The Afar regional government said it was \"doing all the necessary life saving operations\" on the injured migrants following the \"horrific\" accident. It cautioned Ethiopians, particularly the youth, against the dangers of human trafficking driven by false promises.\"We will ensure that the law enforcement work will continue with the concerned authorities to prevent such tragic events from repeating,\" the regional government added.The International Organization for Migration (IOM) describes the journey from the Horn of Africa - composed of Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Eritrea - to Yemen as \"one of the busiest and most perilous mixed migration routes\". Despite the risks, more than 60,000 migrants arrived in Yemen in 2024 alone, many ultimately bound for Saudi Arabia, according to IOM. Additional reporting by Wycliffe Muia",

    "body": "Central African Republic (CAR) President Faustin-Archange Touadéra has won a third term after securing an outright majority in last month's presidential election, provisional results show. The 68-year-old mathematics professor was widely expected to win after the main opposition coalition boycotted the poll, citing concerns about electoral fairness. Touadéra campaigned on his security record in the chronically unstable nation after rebels seized power in 2013, a crisis that led the government to enlist support from Russian mercenaries and Rwandan soldiers.He has faced heavy criticism after a 2023 constitution removed term limits, allowing him to keep running for office.More than 2.4 million people registered for the 28 December general election, which observers described as largely peaceful despite delays caused by the late arrival of voting material and problems with the electoral register.Touadéra secured 76% of the vote, according to preliminary results announced late on Monday by the election agency.His closest challengers, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé and Henri-Marie Dondra, both former prime ministers, received 15% and 3% of the vote respectively.Both have called for the results to be annulled, alleging widespread irregularities and fraud.On Friday, Dologuélé said there had been \"a methodical attempt to manipulate\" the outcome.The main opposition coalition, known by its French acronym BRDC, boycotted the election, saying it was unlikely to be fair.The government has denied the claims. The Constitutional Court has until 20 January to rule on any challenges and declare the final results.The CAR is one of Africa's poorest and most unstable countries, even though it is rich in resources such as diamonds and uranium. The UN estimates that about half the population is dependent on humanitarian aid.Since 2013, the landlocked country has been mired in conflict after rebels seized power, ousting then-President François Bozizé. A 2019 peace deal between the government and 14 armed groups helped ease tensions, though six of the groups later withdrew from the agreement.Analysts say Touadéra's win could bolster the interests of Russia, which has provided security assistance in exchange for access to resources such as gold and diamonds.The CAR was one of the first African countries where Wagner, a Russian mercenary group, became active, providing security to Touadéra.",

It was able to show that tennis can be really huge,\" she said.\"That exhibition, it was fun. It was a great challenge.\"Sabalenka, who received a first-round bye in Brisbane, will face Romania's Sorana Cirstea in round three.The Australian Open starts on 18 January.GB's Boulter and Kartal win in AucklandBritish number four Katie Boulter started her season with victory over Ukraine's Yuliia Starodubtseva at the ASB Classic in Auckland.Playing her first match since October - and her first under new coach Michael Joyce - Boulter triumphed 6-3 6-3 in the first round.Given a main draw wildcard for the WTA 250 tournament, she will face top seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine next.Boulter missed out on a place in the main draw of the Australian Open after falling out of the world's top 100.She is currently the third alternate and, without sufficient withdrawals, will need to win through qualifying at Melbourne Park.Compatriot Sonay Kartal beat Indonesia's Janice Tjen 6-1 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 in the first round in Auckland.World number Kartal 68, who reached the last 16 of Wimbledon in 2025, will play Germany's Ella Seidel in round two.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAlice Cuddy,reporting from Cúcuta, on the Colombia-Venezuela borderandVanessa Buschschlüter,Latin America editor, BBC News OnlineReutersPolice guarded the National Assembly where Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in MondayAt least 14 members of the press were detained in Venezuela on Monday as they were covering the aftermath of the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro by US forces. The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organisations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter deported. Foreign news media have long faced restrictions in Venezuela, with very few being granted visas to work in the country. Their detention came as Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president and shortly after she said that she was willing to co-operate with the Trump administration, which has said it would \"run\"  Venezuela.The union said the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, and in the neighbourhood of Altamira - all in the capital, Caracas.At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service.They said they had their equipment searched, their phones checked and their social media posts and messages read, the union statement added. A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta.The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, the statement said. The union called the incidents \"alarming\" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country. The repression has not been confined to media workers.One community leader in the neighbourhood of Petare, in Caracas, told BBC Mundo that there were \"hooded men with guns patrolling, checking people's WhatsApp statuses\".Caracas resident José, 60, said that people were not able to talk freely about what was happening, with a heavy police and military presence on the streets, as well as pro-Maduro armed groups, known as \"colectivos\", wearing masks.A 33-year-old masseuse, who did not want to be named, said there was \"so much fear in the streets and in our homes\".Members of the government appeared keen to show that the security forces were visible in communities, with the Interior Minister, Diosdado Cabello, posting a photo of himself on Monday night posing with armed police.Their presence has struck fear in people critical of the government. One woman described how there are \"military people on every corner and groups of armed civilians supporting the government who are causing fear among the population\".Another person who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC that \"the regime is not allowing news to come out of here.\" They added that \"there are uniformed personnel on the streets stopping people and checking their phones\".Instagram/@Minsjustice_VEInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello (shown right-of-centre wearing a black cap with red writing) posted this photo on InstagramThe journalist detentions come at a volatile time in Venezuela, where just days ago the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife were seized by US forces in a pre-dawn raid in which dozens of his bodyguards and security detail were killed.While the seizure prompted celebrations among Venezuelans who oppose Maduro and who have left the country, there were no public displays of joy in Venezuela.Opposition Venezuelans have long denounced the repression they face if they speak out against the Maduro government. More than 2,000 people were arrested during protests in the wake of the 2024 presidential election.The government-dominated electoral council declared Maduro the winner of that election but voting tallies collected by the opposition and verified by independent media suggest that it was won by the opposition candidate. In the crackdown which followed the election, members of the security forces checked people's phone for messages critical of Maduro, prompting many Venezuelans to erase their social media accounts and message history. Many of those arrested at the time were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences after being sentenced for \"treason\".According to pressure group Foro Penal, there are more than 800 political prisoners being held in Venezuela as of 5 January.",

    "body": "8 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesNestle has issued a global recall of some baby formula products over concerns they contain a toxin which can cause food poisoning.The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies.The batches were sold across the world, Nestle said, and they potentially contain cereulide, which can trigger nausea and vomiting when consumed.The company said there had been no confirmed reports of illness associated with the products, but was recalling them \"out of an abundance of caution\".\"The safety and wellbeing of babies is our absolute priority,\" Nestle said. \"We sincerely apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused to parents, caregivers, and customers.\"The company confirmed to the BBC that the recall was global. Affected products were sold in several European countries, including France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy and Sweden.It stressed that all other Nestle products and batches of the same products that have not been recalled are safe to consume.Nestle promised refunds for customers and said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers.Nestle France said it was carrying out a \"preventive and voluntary recall\" of certain batches of its Guigoz and Nidal infant formulas.In Germany, the formula products are called Beba and Alfamino.Batch numbers of the affected products in the UK can be found on Nestle's UK website, or through food.gov.uk.Customers are advised to look for the corresponding code on the base of the tin or box for powdered formulas or the base of the outer box and on the side or top of the container for ready-to-feed formulas.NestleNestle has recalled some batches of its SMA infant and follow-on formulaCereulide is a toxin produced by some strains of the Bacillus cereus bacteria that can cause food poisoning symptoms, which can be quick to develop and include vomiting and stomach cramps.It is unlikely to be deactivated or destroyed by cooking, using boiling water or when making the infant milk, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned.The FSA's head of incidents, Jane Rawling, said parents, guardians and caregivers should not feed infants or young children the affected products.She added: \"I want to reassure parents, guardians and caregivers that we are taking urgent action, helping to ensure all of the affected product is removed from sale as a precaution.\"If you have fed this product to a baby and have any concerns about potential health impact, you should seek advice from healthcare professionals by contacting your GP or calling NHS 111.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoAbdirahman Ali Dhimbil,BBC SomaliandWedaeli ChibelushiIsrael's foreign minister has arrived in the breakaway state of Somaliland, marking the first official visit since Israel controversially recognised Somaliland as an independent country.Gideon Saar landed in capital city Hargeisa on Tuesday and met with Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, government sources there told the BBC.Last month Israel became the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland, which declared independence from Somalia more than 30 years ago.Somaliland's president called Israel's move \"a historic moment\", but Somalia furiously rejected the development as an attack on its sovereignty.The Israeli foreign ministry has not publicly commented on Saar's trip, but a diplomatic source in Somaliland told the BBC that the visit is intended to advance political and strategic partnerships.The Somaliland government confirmed Saar's arrival in a post on X.Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991, after the overthrow of Somali military dictator Siad Barre. However, the region has remained largely unrecognised on the global stage and Somalia considers Somaliland to be an integral part of its territory.Israel's recognition of Somaliland last month came as a surprise, with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu citing Somaliland's \"right to self-determination\".This move sparked international condemnation and prompted an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. China, Turkey and the African Union were among those criticising Israel's step, while the European Union said Somalia's sovereignty should be respected.The US defended Israel, accusing its critics of double standards.In a statement following Israel's announcement, Saar said: \"Somaliland was not created this past weekend. It has existed as a functioning state for more than 34 years. \"The attacks on Israel's recognition of Somaliland are hypocritical. Only Israel will decide who to recognise and with who to maintain diplomatic relations.\"President Abdullahi has said Somaliland would join the Abraham Accords, a deal brokered by the Trump administration in 2020, which saw a number of Arab states establish ties with Israel.Israel has pledged to cooperate with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy.Analysts say there are strategic reasons for Israel's declaration.\"Israel requires allies in the Red Sea region for many strategic reasons, among them the possibility of a future campaign against the Houthis,\" Israeli think tank the Institute for National Security Studies said, referring to Yemen's Iran-backed rebels, in a paper last month.",

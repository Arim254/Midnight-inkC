    "body": "19 hours agoDaniela Relph,Royal correspondentandAmy WalkerThe Duchess of Sussex has attempted to contact her estranged father, Thomas Markle, who is reported to be seriously ill in hospital in the Philippines.A spokesman for Meghan said: \"I can confirm she has reached out to her father.\"Mr Markle is reported to have had his leg amputated during surgery. The BBC understands that Meghan tried to contact him earlier today, but it is not clear whether the attempt was successful. The relationship between Meghan and her father broke down in the run-up to her wedding to Prince Harry in 2018.During the couple's engagement, the media interest in Thomas Markle and his family was intense. Mr Markle was found to have colluded with photographers who paid him for photos appearing to show the father of the bride preparing for the wedding.The fallout saw him pull out of his daughter's wedding just days before the ceremony in Windsor, citing health problems.King Charles III - who was then the Prince of Wales - walked Meghan down the aisle instead.It is not clear if Meghan ever resumed any proper relationship with her father following her marriage. Thomas Markle is not believed to have met Harry and Meghan's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.He was critical of his daughter and son-in-law's decision to step back from public duty in the UK and criticise the royal family. In one media interview he said: \"I think they're both turning into lost souls at this point.\"\"I don't know what they're looking for,\" he added. \"I don't think they know what they're looking for.\"",

    "body": "At least 11 people have been killed in a mass shooting at a hostel in South Africa.Fourteen others were wounded when gunmen stormed the venue in Saulsville township, west of the capital Pretoria, early on Saturday. A three-year-old is among the dead.\"At least three unknown gunmen entered this hostel where a group of people were drinking and they started randomly shooting,\" police spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said.The motive of the shooting is unknown and no arrests have been made. It is the latest in a string of mass shootings that have rocked the crime-ridden country in recent years.The gunmen reportedly entered the premise at 04:30 local time (02:30 GMT) and opened fire on a group of men who were drinking. A 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl were among those killed in the attack.\"I can confirm that a total of 25 people were shot,\" Mathe said. Describing the hostel as an \"illegal shebeen\", she added: \"We are having a serious challenge when it comes to these illegal and unlicensed liquor premises,\" where she said the majority of mass shootings occur.\"Innocent people also get caught up in the crossfire,\" she told public broadcaster SABC.In a major crackdown, police shut down 12,000 such premises outlets between April and September this year and arrested more than 18,000 people across the country.South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, at 45 people per 100,000 according to 2023-24 figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Some 63 people were killed every day between April and September, according to police data.",

    "body": "Border clashes have erupted again between Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban forces, with each sides accusing the other of breaking a fragile ceasefire.Residents fled the Afghan city of Spin Boldak overnight, which lies along the 1,600-mile (2,600 km) border between the two countries.A medical worker in the nearby city of Kandahar told BBC Pashto that four bodies had been brought to a local hospital. Four other people were wounded. Three were reportedly wounded in Pakistan.There has been sporadic fighting between the two countries in recent months, while Afghanistan's Taliban government has also accused Pakistan of carrying out air strikes inside the country.Both sides have confirmed they exchanged fire overnight but each blamed the other for initiating the four hours of fighting. Mosharraf Zaidi, a spokesperson for Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accused the Taliban of \"unprovoked firing\".The statement continued: \"An immediate, befitting & intense response has been given by our armed forces. Pakistan remains fully alert & committed to ensuring its territorial integrity & the safety our citizens.\"Meanwhile, a Taliban spokesperson said Pakistan had \"once again initiated attacks\" and said it was \"forced to respond\".Residents on the Afghan side of the border said the exchange of fire started at around 22:30 (18:00 GMT) on Friday.Footage from the area showed a large number of Afghans fleeing on foot and in vehicles. Ali Mohammed Haqmal, head of Kandahar's information department, said Pakistan's forces had attacked with \"light and heavy artillery\" and civilian homes had been hit by mortar fire.The latest clashes came less than two months after both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey.It ended more than a week of fighting in which dozens were killed - the worst clashes between Pakistan and the Taliban since the group returned to power in 2021 - though tensions have remained high.The government in Islamabad has long accused Afghanistan's ruling Taliban of giving shelter to armed groups which carry out attacks in Pakistan.The Taliban government denies the accusation and has accused Pakistan of blaming others for their \"own security failures\".The Pakistan Taliban have carried out at least 600 attacks on Pakistani forces over the past year, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.Last week delegations from both sides met in Saudi Arabia for a fourth round of negotiations on a wider peace settlement, but did not reach an agreement.Sources familiar with the talks told BBC News that both sides had agreed to continue with the ceasefire.",

    "body": "A US judge has ordered the unsealing of grand jury transcripts from the 2005 and 2007 investigation into convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The Florida judge granted the justice department's request for the material following Congress' passage last month of a bill ordering the release of all files on the disgraced financier. The law \"applies to unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" that relate to Epstein and his accomplice-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, the court order said.A similar Department of Justice request was rejected in August because it violated a federal rule on grand jury materials, which the newly signed law overrides.US District Judge Rodney Smith granted the government's expedited motion to unseal the typically secret grand jury transcripts and modify a protective order that previously barred the release of the materials. In Friday's order, reviewed by the BBC, Judge Smith noted \"the later-enacted and specific language of the Act trumps prohibition on disclosure\".The justice department is also requesting the unsealing of documents in New York from Epstein's 2019 sex-trafficking case and Maxwell's 2021 sex-trafficking case.The documents at issue in Friday's ruling in Florida relate to a case investigating whether Epstein abused underage girls. Epstein's struck a controversial non-prosecution agreement in 2008 and pleaded guilty to lesser state prostitution charges.Questions have swirled ever since about how the well-connected financier was allowed to avoid federal sex-trafficking charges.US President Donald Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law last month after previously rejecting calls to release the files. A bipartisan push to release all the records has dogged the president during his second term in office. The newly enacted law compels the justice department, FBI and federal prosecutors by 19 December to disclose the tranche of materials amassed during investigations into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, was moved from a Florida prison to a new minimum-security facility in Texas in August. On Wednesday, Maxwell's attorney filed a letter in Manhattan federal court asking to be released early. While the transparency law gives the justice department 30 days to release the files, the law also allows it to withhold material related to an active criminal investigation that could identify victims of Epstein's abuse, invade their privacy, or contain images of physical and child sex abuse.Material that could jeopardise an active federal investigation, is classified or that pertains to national defence or foreign policy is typically not made public, under justice department policy.Earlier this week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released images of Epstein's infamous island.The photos showed several bedrooms in the US Virgin Islands home, as well as a room with masks on a wall and a phone with the names Darren, Rich, Mike, Patrick, and Larry written on speed-dial buttons.",

    "body": "1 hour agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, BethlehemEPAFor two years during the Gaza war, all public celebrations for Christmas were cancelled in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank – where Christians believe Jesus was born.But after the recent ceasefire, the holy city decided that this year the festivities would return as symbolised by the lighting of its traditional, giant Christmas tree in front of the historic Nativity Church.\"It's been a bad two years of silence; no Christmas, no jobs, no work,\" says Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati. \"We're all living here from tourism and tourism was down to zero.\"The mayor accepts that the idea of resuming celebrations was not without controversy, as suffering continues in Gaza – including for those in its tiny Christian community, many of whom have relatives in Bethlehem.\"Some may say it's not appropriate and others say it's appropriate,\" Mr Canawati tells me. \"But deep inside my heart, I felt that this was the right thing to do because Christmas should never be stopped or cancelled. This is the light of hope for us.\"Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to BethlehemOne tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin American and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare systemAlaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurantThe grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.",

    "body": "18 hours agoBrandon Drenon,Washington DC andMadeline HalpertThe US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on whether some children born in the US have a constitutional right to citizenship.On his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump signed an order to end birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are in the country illegally, but the move was blocked by multiple lower courts.No date has been set yet for the Supreme Court arguments, and a ruling is months away.Whatever the court decides could have major implications for Trump's immigration crackdown and for what it means to be an American citizen.For nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces.The language of the amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"Trump's executive order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or are in the country on temporary visas. It is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reform the nation's immigration system and combat what they have called \"significant threats to national security and public safety\".The administration has argued the 14th Amendment clause \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the amendment excludes children of people who are not in the country permanently or lawfully.Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, told the BBC's news partner CBS that no president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,\"  Ms Wang said in a statement. \"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term,\" she added.The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.After legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal  court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.Trump then went to the Supreme Court to fight the injunctions. In a win for Trump, the court ruled in June that the injunctions issued by the lower courts exceeded their authority, though it did not address the issue of birthright citizenship itself. The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.US Solicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the amendment was adopted \"to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens\".He has said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on US soil confers citizenship and has argued that that understanding has had \"destructive consequences\"About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2016 - a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007, according to The Pew Research Center.By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.A study published in May by the thinktank Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University's Population Research Institute suggested that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the size of the unauthorized population in the US by an additional 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.",

    "body": "1 day agoVikas Pandey,DelhiandRuth ComerfordRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide \"uninterrupted shipments\" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil.Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow.President Donald Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on most Indian products, arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies.Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a \"peaceful solution\" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas or Russia would seize it.\"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on \"the side of peace\", welcoming efforts to find a \"lasting\" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the \"connectivity\" of Russia and India was a \"major priority\" for India.In recent months, India-US ties have hit an all-time low as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable\" at the time.  In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US.\"The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,\" he asked.Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, Bloomberg reported in September - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May.  The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture.Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia.Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said.No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals.India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry.Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years.Modi said that \"energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership\", but made no specific reference to oil.India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions.Putin also referenced a \"flagship project\": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with.In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being \"reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms\".Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a \"more just\" and \"multi-polar\" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations.",

    "body": "North American leaders take stage together for the first time17 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,at the White HouseandNadine Yousif,in Toronto Watch: World Cup hosts Trump, Sheinbaum and Carney take stage togetherIt was all smiles at Washington DC's Kennedy Centre as the leaders of the US, Mexico and Canada took the stage for the 2026 World Cup draw, even as trade tensions simmered in the background.For Donald Trump, the brief interaction marked his first meeting with Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum, who leads the largest trading partner for the US. While Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has already met with Trump several times, trade talks have been halted. Trump this week signalled that the US is still weighing whether it will leave in place a single long-standing free trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico or look at separate bilateral deals.The agreement - known as the USMCA - is up for a mandatory review next year. Carney has credited it with shielding Canadian businesses from the bulk of US-imposed tariffs on Canada. Those underlying tensions seemed distant on Friday, when the leaders took the stage together to select the balls of their own countries from bowls, marking the beginning of a process to select groups for the initial stage of the jointly-hosted tournament. The leaders' body language appeared cordial and warm. Collectively, they posed for a selfie with Fifa President Gianni Infantino on stage. Reporters later saw Trump sitting with Sheinbaum, who had said earlier in the week that she planned to have a brief one-on-one with Trump to discuss trade matters, including steel, aluminium and automobile tariffs, on the sidelines of the event.The Trump administration has largely backed away from threats to impose steep tariffs as negotiations continue. Carney was sitting beside Sheinbaum. Both have expressed an interest in securing the future of the USMCA, which has been in place in some form since 1994. Its fate is uncertain pending the outcome of the mandatory review due to be completed in the summer of 2026.Trump also met for a brief 45 minutes with Sheinbaum and Carney on Friday.In a statement, Sheinbaum said they talked about the World Cup and separately  \"agreed to continue working together on trade issues with our teams\".Carney's office said the three agreed to keep working together on the USMCA. Getty ImagesThe US, Mexico and Canada are jointly hosting next year's Fifa World Cup. Trump told reporters in the White House on Wednesday that the US will \"either let it expire, or we'll maybe work out another deal with Mexico and Canada\".He added that he believed both Canada and Mexico had \"taken advantage\" of the US.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told news outlet Politico on Thursday that Trump is considering dividing the agreement into two parts.\"Our relationship with the Canadian economy is totally different than our relationship with the Mexican economy,\" Greer said, adding: \"It actually doesn't make a ton of economic sense why we would marry those three together.\"The current USMCA deal was signed by Trump during his first term. At the time, he praised it as \"the best agreement we've ever made\".American businesses have so far signalled that they want the trade agreement to remain in place.At a three-day public hearing about the coming review of the agreement in Washington this week, speakers from agriculture, business and policy groups said it has allowed them to access Canadian and Mexican markets.The World Cup draw also saw President Trump receive the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize, which Infantino said was \"in recognition of his exceptional and extraordinary actions to promote peace and unity around the world\".In brief remarks, Trump said that award was \"one of the honours\" of his life.

    "description": "A US panel of vaccine advisers has voted to end the longstanding recommendation for vaccinations against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) right after birth",
    "body": "A US panel of vaccine advisers has voted to end the longstanding recommendation for vaccinations against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) right after birth. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip) voted 8-3 to back \"individual-based decision-making\" on whether to vaccinate babies born to mothers who have tested negative for the liver infection.  In June, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, fired all the members of the Acip and replaced them with others who are critical of vaccines.The US has recommended vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B since 1991, and data suggests that since then, the shots have prevented an estimated 90,000 deaths.Hours after the decision, President Donald Trump ordered his top health officials to review all childhood vaccination recommendations in the US. In a White House memo, he requested that they \"review best practices from peer, developed countries for core childhood vaccination recommendations\".  If they find other countries' practices are superior, then Trump directs them to change the US schedule.He noted in the memo that some other countries recommend fewer immunisations for children.Trump also praised the advisory committee for their Friday decision, calling it \"very good\" in a social media post. The Acip is responsible for making recommendations to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on when and who should be vaccinated. The acting director of the CDC has the final sign-off on the recommendation. The new guidance also suggests that babies who do not receive a birth dose of the vaccine should get their initial dose of the shot \"no earlier than two months of age\", a recommendation that several members of the group opposed. Public health experts worry the vote could raise unfounded safety concerns about the vaccine and encourage some people to opt out, leading to more sickness.The concern was shared by some members of the Acip panel.\"The hepatitis B vaccine recommendation is very well established,\" Dr Cody Meissner said before voting no. \"We know it's safe and we know it's very effective. And to make the changes that are being proposed, we will see more children and adolescents and adults infected with hepatitis B.\"The panel continues to recommend that babies born to mothers who have tested positive for hepatitis B be given a birth dose of the vaccine. The move is not expected to affect insurance coverage of the shot. Hepatitis B is a liver infection that spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids, and can lead to dangerous liver conditions including cancer, liver failure and cirrhosis. Pregnant people who have hepatitis B also can transmit the virus to newborns during delivery, which can lead to chronic infections that can damage the liver.People infected with HBV do not always have symptoms, meaning they may not even be aware they are carrying the virus and can spread it while caring for children and infants.Friday's decision came after a tense two-day meeting on the issue, after the Acip decided to postpone a vote on the hepatitis B shots two times.  On Friday, several members of the panel voiced their objections to the new guidelines, and in particular, that shots be recommended no sooner than two months of age. The voting choices are \"incredibly problematic\", Dr Joseph Hibbeln said, while Dr Meissner said members were acting on \"baseless sceptisicm\".One committee member in favour of the change, Retsef Levi, said the US hepatitis B vaccine policy was \"misaligned\" with other countries around the world.The World Health Organization recommends vaccinating children against HBV at zero, one and six-months old. In the UK, vaccines are recommended at eight weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks old, unless a mother has tested positive for the virus.During hours of meetings on Thursday and Friday, the committee heard from several physicians, including many who criticised the panel for considering ending universal vaccination recommendations.Committee members who voted in favour of the new recommendations argued that the risk of catching the virus was low and that vaccines should be tailored to individual patients.Critics of the birth dose have argued that babies should only be vaccinated as newborns if their mother tests positive for the virus. But doctors say this leaves some babies at risk, because not all pregnant people have reliable access to testing, while others could receive a false negative test for hepatitis B.Kennedy and his allies have questioned the safety of the hepatitis B vaccine and have argued it is primarily spread through sexual contact and sharing needles.Research has shown, however, that it can also spread through indirect contact such as shared toothbrushes and razors.Since taking office, Kennedy has made a number of changes to US vaccine policy. The Acip's decision to revisit the vaccine recommendations sparked anger from Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician who cast a deciding vote in confirming Kennedy as health secretary despite worries about his previous stances on vaccines.\"As a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B for decades, this change to the vaccine schedule is a mistake,\" Cassidy said in a statement. \"The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. The birth dose is a recommendation, NOT a mandate.\"In response to the committee's vote, Maryland's state health department issued an issued an advisory on Friday, citing a recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics, urging health care providers and hospitals to continue to offer the hep B vaccines at birth and said it was working to secure access to the vaccine for all infants and children in the state.",

    "body": "Twitch star QTCinderella says she wishes she never started streaming18 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterBBCThe popular Twitch streamer QTCinderella says she would be a \"happier person\" if she could go back and tell her younger self to choose a different career.The 31-year-old, real name Blaire (she does not make her second name public), became famous for playing video games and cooking meals in live videos for her 1.2 million followers online.In 2021 she created the annual Streamer Awards, which will be streamed online on Saturday.But she told the BBC while she felt \"incredibly lucky\" to be in her position, the negatives of the role - ranging from being under constant scrutiny to at times being concerned for her safety - makes it difficult to enjoy.\"If I could go back and never experience some of the things I've experienced because of this job, I do think I would be a happier person overall,\" she said.\"The biggest thing I wish I could do, if I went back and was able to whisper in my ear, I would say, don't do it.\"Getty ImagesQTCinderella at the Streamer Awards in 2024Throughout 2025, several female content creators have spoken out about concerns of their safety, particularly when attending public events.In March, three US Twitch streamers, Cinna, Valkyrae and Emiru, were taking part in a week-long marathon stream when a man threatened to kill them.Then, at the annual streamer event TwitchCon in October, a man from the crowd grabbed Emiru and tried to kiss her without her consent.While her personal security were able to intervene, she accused the on-site security team of not detaining him until hours after the event - something Twitch refuted in a statement.Harassment - or the threat of it - is an issue which Blaire says she has also had to face since her rise in popularity online.\"I could open my Instagram DMs right now and read you 100 horrible things about why or how I could be harmed by people,\" she said.In 2021, Blaire said she spent over $2,000 (£1,500) every month to have heavily edited photos of her removed from the internet.Then in January 2023, she discovered a deepfake website was using a likeness of her in pornographic material, alongside other popular female streamers.Now, she said despite opening a craft shop in Los Angeles earlier this year, it's rare she ever visits - because of men turning up to the shop and asking for her.\"I thought it'd be fun,\" she said.\"Unfortunately, it's gotten to the point where I can't go there because we've had men show up looking for me.\"I don't want it to be unsafe for my employees.\"From drama to positivityBlaire said she thought security at the Streamer Awards would be \"aggressive\" in comparison to other events, as she hopes to help the attendees from the streaming world feel as safe as possible.The ceremony recognises top creators across various categories like Gamer of the Year and Best Community, while this year's Streamer of the Year nominees includes the most-followed Twitch streamer with 20 million followers, Kai Cenat.A mix of 70% fan votes and 30% industry panellists decide the winners.In November, Blaire faced accusations from viewers claiming certain popular streamers were blocked from particular categories for being too \"problematic\" - which she denied.Clips of the streamer tearfully replying to criticisms of the event soon spread online.\"I think I need to respond less\", she said.\"But as a human, you just want to be understood\".The constant ebb and flow of streamer \"drama\" which many content creators like Blaire experience is one of the reasons she finds the job tough - but she said it was also why she started the awards.\"For me, it's really important to bring people together, because I do think there's lots of toxicity on the internet,\" she said. \"And if people were just able to have a dinner together or reach across the board, it makes a big difference.\"For one night of the year, the negativity is silent\".",

    "body": "11 minutes agoNardine SaadandHarry SekulichRussia has launched a major aerial bombardment against Ukrainian infrastructure targets as talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida are set to enter a third day.Overnight Russia launched 653 drones and 51 missiles, most of which were downed, authorities said. One strike hit a railway hub at the town of Fastiv southwest of Kyiv, destroying the main station building and damaging rolling stock.Russia says it targeted military-industrial sites, and energy and port infrastructure.Condemning the new attacks, French President Emmanuel Macron announced he would go to London on Monday for a meeting with Ukrainian, British and German leaders aimed at putting pressure on Moscow. \"We must continue to put pressure on Russia to force it towards peace,\" Macron posted on X.He said he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in London to take stock of the ongoing negotiations being mediated by the US.     Earlier US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\" after talks in Moscow failed to produce a breakthrough.Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy sector and infrastructure in recent weeks. On Saturday Ukraine's energy ministry said Russian attacks had hit energy facilities in eight regions, causing blackouts. Zelensky said the attack on the rail hub had been \"meaningless from a military point of view, and the Russians could not have been unaware of this\".Meanwhile the UN's nuclear watchdog said the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had temporarily lost all external power overnight - the 11th time this has happened since Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour.While it is not currently producing electricity, it needs power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.In Florida, a statement posted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff said two days of talks with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's national security council, had been \"constructive\".Witkoff and Umerov \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" that could such an agreement and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\", their statement said without giving details.The prospect of ending the war depended on Russia's readiness to take \"steps towards de-escalation and cessation of killing\", the statement added.The negotiations, which are also attended by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, will continue for a third day on Saturday. The Florida talks saw Ukraine's team briefed on a recent meeting between Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Witkoff spent almost five hours with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, after which the Kremlin said \"no compromise\" had been reached on a draft US peace plan. The Kremlin said Putin was ready to continue meeting the Americans \"as many times as needed\", but Ukraine and its allies in Europe have called into question the Russian leader's commitment to ending the war.On Friday, Zelensky said he wanted to \"obtain full information about what was said in Moscow and what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war\".Kyiv pushed for revisions to the initial US peace plan, which was widely seen as favourable to Moscow when an initial version leaked to the media. An updated version has not been shared publicly.Major points of contention remain between the two sides, including security guarantees for Ukraine post-war and territorial concessions. Russia currently controls roughly one-fifth of Ukraine's territory, including swathes of the Donbas area in the east – made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In an interview with India Today on Friday, Putin warned Ukrainian troops to withdraw fully from the region this week, saying Russia would otherwise \"liberate these [Donbas] territories by force\".Kyiv and its European allies believe the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato, or to provide comprehensive security guarantees. Russia is staunchly opposed, while Trump too has repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Ukraine join the military alliance.The prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a \"key question\" that was tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.Trump said those talks were \"reasonably good\", but it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".",

    "body": "2 days agoBrandon DrenonAj AwerAj Awer, of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, says Trump's comments were \"dangerous\"Somali-Americans in Minnesota have described their heightened fear after US President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of the community this week.Community leaders told the BBC the \"apprehension is palpable\" following Trump's remarks, in which he said he did not want Somalis in the US and the country would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage\".\"When you're being targeted by the president of the United States, it's not really a good feeling,\" said Aj Awed, executive director of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, which represents a town known as Little Mogadishu for its large Somali population.Concern has also intensified because of reports that officials have begun an enforcement operation in Minnesota targeting undocumented immigrants.Mr Awed said the council would discuss the risks of holding an annual event scheduled for next week in-person because of the operation.\"The people that are getting caught up in this are people who don't speak that great of English, but who have been citizens for decades,\" he said. \"Just because you have an accent does not make you less American.\"Trump made disparaging comments criticising the Somali community at the White House on Tuesday. \"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you… their country is no good for a reason,\"he said.Mr Awed said the comments were \"dangerous\", adding it was \"not becoming of a president to be just attacking other Americans\".He also expressed concerns of violence that could follow.\"When the president puts a bull's eye on the immigrant community here\", that could encourage others to become \"more radicalised\", he said.President Trump's comments came after he was questioned about large-scale fraud in Minnesota's social assistance programme.Watch: Trump says he 'doesn't want' Somali migrants in USDozens of people have been charged over a scheme that federal prosecutors say involved a charity fraudulently billing the Minnesota government for meals for children during the Covid-19 pandemic. A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme, which ultimately cost the state tens of millions of dollars, according to Kayseh Magan, a former investigator in Minnesota's attorney general's office.While those accused of involvement represent a small fraction of Minnesota's large Somali population, Trump has repeatedly criticised the community, writing in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\".The House Oversight Committee said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's handling of the allegations.'Anyone who looks like me is scared' Jamal Osman, a member of the Minneapolis City Council, moved to the US when he was 14 and is a naturalised citizen. \"Anyone who looks like me [is] scared right now,\" he told CBS News.Of the fraud allegations that Trump has repeatedly referenced in his criticism of the Somali community, Osman said: \"My community is upset. Yes, people commit crimes, but an entire community should not be blamed based on what some individuals did.\"The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota.It said its enforcement operation would target those who have been issued final deportation orders. That operation began on Wednesday,  according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.Abdilatif HassanKowsar Mohamed says Trump's comments have led to increased concern\"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is already here,\" said Kowsar Mohamed, who lives in south Minneapolis. The city is home to more than 80,000 people of Somali descent.\"We're seeing boots on the ground activity where folks are just being plucked off of the streets and being asked about their residency status. That's not a data informed approach,\" she said.\"Most folks have the identification necessary, so the fear is not around proof. The fear is around mistakes happening.\"There have been numerous reports of masked federal officers detaining US citizens and other lawful residents - over 170 instances, according to a ProPublica investigation in October.Social media videos filled with images of ICE agents smashing suspect's car windows and throwing them to the ground during detainments add to immigrants' fears, whether undocumented or not.A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, denied that any people would be targeted based on race.\"Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,\" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. \"What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally.\"Local community organisations had been anticipating increased immigration enforcement, but after Trump's comments they ramped up preparations, Ms Mohamed said. One organisation, Monarca, has scheduled \"legal observer training\" in Minneapolis to educate people on their rights when witnessing federal immigration activity. Other ways the community is bracing itself, Ms Mohamed said, is by having emergency contacts ready-to-go in case of ICE encounters, and private messaging groups where people share photos of unmarked cars and masked agents.\"Everyone is just going to be in the space of caution,\" she said. \"Is there fear? Absolutely. But no one is tucking behind their tail.\" ",

    "body": "14 hours agoSakshi Venkatraman,US reporterandHarry SekulichREUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoFrank Gehry, one of the most influential architects of the last century, has died aged 96.Gehry was acclaimed for his avant garde, experimental style of architecture. His titanium-covered design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, catapulted him to fame in 1997. His breakthrough in the architectural world came years earlier when he redesigned his own home in Santa Monica, California, using materials like chain-link fencing, plywood, and corrugated steel.His death was confirmed by his chief of staff Meaghan Lloyd. He is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Leslie and Brina, as well as his wife, Berta Isabel Aguilera, and their two sons, Alejandro and Samuel.Getty ImagesThe Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, one of Gehry's most famous worksBorn in Toronto in 1929, Gehry moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to study architecture at the University of Southern California, before completing further study at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1956 and 1957.After starting his own firm, he broke from traditional architectural principles of symmetry, using unconventional geometric shapes and unfinished materials in a style now known as deconstructivism. Through blending unexpected materials and sheathing buildings in stainless steel to create curvy exteriors, Gehry created buildings that took on arresting sculptural shapes.Later in his career, Gehry used 3D modelling similar to that used by aerospace engineers to shape windy buildings, a practice largely avoided by other architects because of the complexity and costliness of construction.In 1989, at the age of 60, Gehry was awarded the industry's top accolade, the Pritzker Architecture prize, for lifetime achievement.The Pritzker jury said his work possessed a \"highly refined, sophisticated and adventurous aesthetic\".\"His designs, if compared to American music, could best be likened to Jazz, replete with improvisation and a lively unpredictable spirit,\" the panel said at the time.Gehry's international breakthrough with the Guggenheim transformed the city of Bilbao, boosting tourism to the city and the local economy. Crafted out of titanium sheets, limestone, and glass, the museum was instantly celebrated as a modern marvel.Architect Philip Johnson, Gehry's American contemporary, described the structure as \"the greatest building of our time\". Other cities tried to replicate its success, branded the \"Bilbao effect\", where investment in daring art could revitalise ailing economies.The cultural phenomenon was parodied in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, in which the fictional town of Springfield invites Gehry, who voiced himself in the cartoon TV show, to design a new concert hall. In the episode, the shape of the concert hall is jokingly inspired by a letter Gehry had scrunched up.The guest appearance later \"haunted\" Gehry, who told the Observer in 2011 that people sincerely believed his real-life designs were inspired by crumpled paper instead of complex computations.'Pushing the envelope'His work in Bilbao put him in high demand, and he went on to design iconic structures in cities all over the world: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park, the Gehry Tower in Germany, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. \"He bestowed upon Paris and upon France his greatest masterpiece,\" said Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, the worlds largest luxury goods company which owns Louis Vuitton.With a largely unpredictable style, no two of his works look the same. Prague's Dancing House, finished in 1996, looks like a glass building folding in on itself; his Hotel Marques in Spain, built in 2006, features thin sheets of wavy, multicoloured metal; his design for a business school in Sydney looks like a brown paper bag.Gehry also designed the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, layered in metal resembling sails billowing in the wind. After it opened in 2003, critics described it as a \"pile of broken crockery\", a \"fortune cookie gone berserk\" and an \"emptied waste basket\".In a 2007 interview with the New Yorker, Gehry shrugged off the concert hall's critics: \"At least they're looking!\" he quipped. Tributes are celebrating his eagerness to discard convention - and forge his own creative legacy.Paul Goldberger, author of Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry, came to know Gehry closely, and said he wanted to work \"until the day he died\".\"He was one of the very few architects of our time to engage people emotionally,\" Goldberger told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.\"He was all about pushing the envelope... wanting to use the most advanced technology to do the most adventurous things.\"In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney extended his \"deepest condolences\" to Gehry's family and the \"many admirers of his work\". He added: \"His unmistakable vision lives on in iconic buildings around the world.\"Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum posted a video tribute to Gehry.\"We will be forever grateful,\" the museum wrote on Instagram, \"his spirit and legacy will always remain connected to Bilbao\".",

    "description": "5 hours agoImogen FoulkesGeneva CorrespondentThe United Nations committee on torture says there is evidence that Israel is operating a \"de facto state",
    "body": "5 hours agoImogen FoulkesGeneva CorrespondentThe United Nations committee on torture says there is evidence that Israel is operating a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\". The committee regularly reviews the records of all countries which have signed the convention against torture, taking testimony from their governments, and from human rights groups.During Israel's review both Israeli and Palestinian rights groups gave harrowing details about conditions in Israeli detention centres. It is alleged that thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel since the Hamas attacks of October 7th 2023. Under Israel's laws on administrative detention and on Unlawful Combatants – suspects who cannot be classed as prisoner of war - they can be held for long periods without access to a lawyer or family members. Many Palestinian families say they have waited months to even find out that a loved has been detained, amounting, the UN committee said, to \"enforced disappearance\".The committee was particularly critical of Israel's reported use of the Unlawful Combatants law to detain whole groups of Palestinians, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.But it is the reported conditions in detention which make the grimmest reading in the committee's conclusions, published today. Palestinians, the evidence suggests, are regularly deprived of food and water, and subjected to severe beatings, attacks by dogs, electrocution, water boarding, and sexual violence. Some are allegedly permanently shackled, denied access to a toilet, and forced to wear diapers.The committee concluded that such treatment \"amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity\". It said evidence of a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\" by Israel was one of the acts which constitute the crime of genocide under international law. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.One committee member, Peter Vedel Kessing of Denmark, said he and his colleagues were \"deeply appalled\" by what they heard. Committee members also said they were very concerned at the lack of investigations or prosecutions into allegations of torture. They called on Israel to launch independent investigations, and to ensure those responsible, including senior military officers, are held accountable.Israel, which has long accused the UN of bias against it, did not comment publicly today on the committee's findings, but during the committee hearings its ambassador, Daniel Meron, described the allegations of torture as \"disinformation\". He said that Israel was \"committed to upholding its obligations in line with our moral values and principles, even in the face of the challenges posed by a terrorist organisation\".In its conclusions, the UN committee took care to unequivocally condemn the Hamas attack of October 2023, and acknowledged the security challenges Israel faces. But it also warned that violations of international law by one side did not justify the other side doing the same. Under the convention, to which Israel is a party, the prohibition on torture is absolute: it is not allowed under any circumstances.Israel's domestic law is less clear however, suggesting that the convention only applies to Israeli territory, and not to the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank – an interpretation that many international lawyers dispute.The findings come amid increasing pressure on Israel over its human rights record. On Friday in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Office said the killing by Israeli soldiers of two Palestinians in the West Bank looked like a \"summary execution\". Video of the killing showed the two men with their hands up, apparently surrendering to Israeli forces.And UN aid agencies say conditions for people in the Gaza strip remain dire, despite the ceasefire. Thousands of families are facing the winter cold and rain in tents, they warn, not enough aid supplies are getting in, and Israeli air strikes against what Israel says are Hamas targets continue.",

    "body": "Scientists believe they have recorded electrical activity in the Martian atmosphere for the first time, suggesting the planet is capable of lightning.Nasa's Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology and has spent the last four years exploring the Jezero Crater region.Electrical discharges nicknamed \"mini lightning\" were picked up from audio and electromagnetic recordings made by the rover's SuperCam instrument.Scientists hope new instruments for measuring atmospheric discharges and more-sensitive cameras could be sent to Mars to try to confirm the findings.A team of researchers from France analysed 28 hours of microphone recordings made by the Nasa rover over two Martian years (or 1,374 Earth days).They found that electrical discharges were normally associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts.Dust devils are small whirlwinds that form from hot air rising from the ground, and their internal movements can give rise to electrical discharges.Lead author of the research Dr Baptiste Chide told news agency Reuters: \"These discharges represent a major discovery, with direct implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability and the future of robotic and human exploration.\"He and other scientists at the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in France believe that Mars now joins Earth, Saturn and Jupiter as planets known to have atmospheric electrical activity.Particle physicist Dr Daniel Pritchard wrote in scientific journal Nature that, although the recordings would \"provide persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges\", because the discharges were only heard and not seen, \"some doubt will inevitably remain as to whether this really was Martian lightning\". He added: \"Given the history of this field, the debate is likely to continue for some time.\"In September this year, scientists found rocks with unusual markings on Mars. The intriguing markings, nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds, contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient microbes.It is possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found.Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life.Perseverance was dispatched to the Jezero Crater because it showed qualities that may have meant it was once conducive to life, including signs it was once a delta when Mars could sustain liquid surface water.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul NjieBBC Africa reporterSenegal's prime minister and Nigeria's former president have both said they do not believe the ousting of Guinea-Bissau's president by the country's military was a genuine coup.Former President Umaro Sissoco Embaló's apparent removal came a day before authorities were due to announce election results. The military has since suspended the electoral process and blocked the results' release, and has insisted it thwarted a plot to destabilise the politically unstable country.Senegal's PM Ousmane Sonko and Nigeria's ex-leader Goodluck Jonathan demanded the presidential election results be released, but did not provide evidence to support their claims the coup was fabricated.The ex-president arrived in neighbouring Senegal on a chartered military flight late on Thursday,  following his release by the military forces who toppled his government.Nigeria's former leader Jonathan, who led a team of election observers from the West African Elders Forum to Guinea-Bissau, said the incident \"was not a coup\".He described it as a \"ceremonial coup\", questioning the events that preceded Wednesday's announcement of a power grab by the military.He specifically wondered why President Embaló was the first to announce his own overthrow and drew contrasts with how other leaders in the region were ousted in recent coups. Embaló phoned up French TV station France 24 and said: \"I have been deposed.\"Meanwhile, Senegal's Sonko told lawmakers that \"what happened in Guinea-Bissau was a sham\".The statements of both men add to claims by the opposition that the coup was staged, although none has so far presented evidence to support this.Embaló has not commented on the allegations.On Friday, Guinea-Bissau's transitional leader Gen Horta N'Tam appointed Ilidio Vieira Té, previously the finance minister, as the new prime minister.Additionally, the African Union suspended Guinea-Bissau on Friday following the unconstitutional military takeover, AFP reports. The West African bloc Ecowas took a similar action, while urging the military to return to the barracks.Guinea-Bissau is a coup-prone West African nation which is also strained by drug trafficking. The military said they were taking power to thwart a plot by unnamed politicians who had \"the support of a well-known drug baron\" to destabilise the country.A mother of three told the BBC it was not the first military takeover she had lived through, nonetheless it came as a surprise as people were expecting to hear about the outcome of the election, which had an estimated voter turnout of more than 65%.\"We heard gunfire. We ran away. We tried to pack our bags to go home,\" she said.Another resident of the capital, Bissau, said he was unhappy about the situation.\"This doesn't help anyone. Because it puts the country into chaos,\" Mohamed Sylla told the BBC.But reactions have been mixed, with some residents praising the army and hoping for an orderly transition.\"I am not against the military regime as long as they improve the living conditions in the country,\" Suncar Gassama told the BBC.",

    "body": "17 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondent,andKoh EweA Japanese court has ruled the country's ban on same-sex marriage as  constitutional - bucking a trend set by courts around the country that had raised hopes for marriage equality in Japan.The ruling was met with disappointment from plaintiffs and their legal team who had gathered outside the Tokyo courthouse.Japan is the only G7 country that does not fully recognise same-sex couples or offer them clear legal protection. But it's not an outlier in Asia, where only Taiwan, Thailand and Nepal offer same-sex marriages.Ayumi Higashi, the judge who delivered the verdict, said laws on same-sex marriage should first be deliberated in parliament, the newspaper Mainichi reported.Outside the Tokyo courthouse on Friday, the plaintiffs of the lawsuit and their legal team held up signs that read \"unjust verdict\", local media reported.Shino Kawachi, one of the plaintiffs, told local media that the ruling was \"difficult to comprehend\". \"What is justice? Was the court even watching us? Were they considering the next generation?\" she told local media.Her partner, Hiromi Hatogai, said she was \"extremely outraged\" and wondered if the judiciary was \"on our side\". But, she added, they would \"keep fighting\". Amnesty International described the ruling as a \"damaging step backwards on same-sex marriage\".\"The Japanese government needs to be proactive in moving towards the legalisation of same-sex marriage so that couples can fully enjoy the same marriage rights as their heterosexual counterparts,\" the rights group's East Asia researcher Boram Jang said in a statement.The verdict on Friday is the last among six high court rulings on same-sex marriage lawsuits filed between 2019 and 2021, in courts across the country from Sapporo to Osaka to Fukuoka.Among them, five found the ban unconstitutional - though they rejected the plaintiffs' compensation claims.Friday's ruling by the Tokyo high court marks an exception to this series of verdicts, which had been adding weight to the push for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Japan.The cases will next be taken to the Supreme Court.",

    "body": "Runaway nuns can stay in Alpine convent if they leave social media6 hours agoBethany BellIn ViennaBethany Bell/BBCSister Rita (L),  Sister Regina (C) and Sister Bernadette have gained a substantial following for their social media postsThree Austrian nuns in their 80s who ran away from the old people's home where they were placed have been told they can stay in their former convent \"until further notice\".However, Church authorities say they can only stay if they stop posting on social media.Sister Bernadette, 88, Sister Regina, 86, and Sister Rita, 82, are the last nuns at the Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen, near Salzburg.In a statement released in their name, they said they were willing to reach an agreement in principle but their legitimate claims and needs would have to be taken seriously.They indicated they were not entirely happy with the Church's offer, saying it had the \"character of a gagging contract\".The three nuns say they were taken out of the convent against their will in December 2023.In September, they moved back in with the help of former students and a locksmith, angering Church officials.The nuns' superior, Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey, called on them to return to the care home, saying their decision to return to the convent was \"completely incomprehensible\".The nuns' story sparked worldwide interest. Supporters helped them with food, electricity and social media, posting videos of the nuns' daily lives.These feature the nuns at prayer or at lunch, and include Sister Rita's exercise workouts. She was recently given a pair of boxing gloves.The Goldenstein nuns have amassed almost 100,000 followers on Instagram and several thousand on Facebook.Now after almost three months of standoff, a spokesman for the Provost, Harald Schiffl, has told Austrian Press Agency APA that the nuns can stay for now.It follows a meeting earlier this week, where a proposed solution to the standoff was suggested.The nuns could stay at the Kloster Goldenstein, Harald Schiffl told APA, but only under certain conditions. These include giving up their social media activities.Church officials also want the nuns to ensure that the enclosed part of the convent will no longer be accessible to people who do not belong to the order.In return, they will be allowed to stay and be provided with medical care and spiritual support from a priest.BBC/Bethany BellThe three nuns have lived in Schloss Goldenstein for decades\"Now it's up to the sisters,\" Harald Schiffl told APA.According to the statement released on Friday, the three sisters would have no future recourse to advice from lawyers and the requirement for them and their helpers to cease their social media activity had \"no legal basis and... would deprive the sisters of their only remaining protection from the interested public\".The three nuns have spent much of their lives at Schloss Goldenstein, a castle which has been a convent and a private girls' school since 1877. The school, which started accepting boys in 2017, is still functioning.Sister Bernadette attended the school herself, arriving as a teenager in 1948. One of her fellow students was Austrian actress Romy Schneider, one of the world's biggest film stars of the 1960s and 70s.Sister Regina arrived at the convent in 1958 and Sister Rita in 1962.All three nuns went on to work at the school as teachers for many years. Sister Regina was headmistress.But the numbers of nuns dwindled. In 2022, the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the Reicherberg Abbey, an Augustinian monastery. Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey became the nuns' superior and the community was officially dissolved at the beginning of 2024.The remaining nuns were granted lifelong right of residence, as long as their health and mental capacity allowed.In December 2023, the decision was made to transfer them to a Catholic care home, where they felt unhappy.At the beginning of September, Sister Bernadette, Sister Rita and Sister Regina moved back, helped by a group of former students.The nuns told the BBC at the time that they were determined to stay.\"Before I die in that old people's home, I would rather go to a meadow and enter eternity that way,\" said Sister Bernadette.",

    "body": "9 hours agoRaffi BergReutersIsrael's military has released footage showing an air strike hitting a buildingAt least 13 people have been killed in an Israeli raid on a village in southern Syria overnight, state media reported, in one of the deadliest incidents of its kind for months. It said children were among the dead.Sana news agency said residents of Beit Jinn \"confronted\" Israeli troops, leading to a firefight. Air strikes were also carried out. Syria's foreign ministry condemned what it called a \"war crime\" by Israel.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops went into the village, on the edge of the occupied Golan Heights, to detain militants who it said \"advanced terror attacks against Israeli civilians\".Six Israeli soldiers were injured in the clashes, three seriously, it said. The IDF said it targeted the Jamaa Islamiya militant group in Friday's operation. It said that when the raid began, \"several armed terrorists opened fire\" on its soldiers, who fired back. Sana said the village was also shelled. Footage released by the IDF shows two air strikes - one apparently on a group of people, and the other on a building. In bodycam footage also released by the IDF, soldiers can be seen firing on a street in the dark with the sound of automatic gunfire in the distance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, said a building collapsed during the operation.The IDF later said \"all of the suspects were apprehended, and a number of terrorists were eliminated\".Sana said three people were arrested by the troops before they withdrew.ReutersIsrael said it targeted militants, although Syria said women and children were among the deadSana quoted the director of a local hospital as saying it had received bodies, including five from one family. The director said dozens of people had also been injured in the incident.The Syrian foreign ministry said more than 10 civilians had been killed, including women and children. It accused Israel of committing a \"fully-fledged war crime\", and called on the UN Security Council to do something to stop Israel's \"policy of aggression\". Israel regularly carries out incursions into Syrian villages, saying it acts to prevent the presence of armed groups.Since the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad nearly a year ago, Israel has moved its forces across a buffer zone on the Golan Heights into southern Syria, where a number of anti-Israel groups and cells operate.Israel says it will not allow the Syrian army, which it considers a threat, to deploy there.The buffer zone - a demilitarised stretch of land - had been a no-go area designed to keep the peace after a ceasefire ended the 1973 war between Israel and Syria. The UN has said the IDF's deployment there was a \"violation\" of the agreement which it said both sides should uphold.The US has for months been mediating talks between Israel and Syria for a security agreement in the area between the two sides, but without success.",

    "body": "10 hours agoNadine YousifWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromOne of the two members of the National Guard who were shot in Washington DC on Wednesday has died, US President Donald Trump said.Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries while the second National Guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, \"is fighting for his life\", Trump said on Thursday evening.Both were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown DC just after 14:00 EST (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Police have arrested one suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old from Afghanistan.On Friday, the US attorney for Washington DC announced the initial charges of assault against the suspect will be upgraded to \"murder in the first degree\".\"It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn't know what was coming,\" Jeanine Pirro told Fox and Friends. \"And that is the homicide, and that is the murder that we're looking at right now.\"The two soldiers who were attacked had been deployed to the American capital as part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on what it sees as rampant crime in several US cities.Trump confirmed Ms Beckstrom's death while on a Thanksgiving call with US service members. \"Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we're talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person... She's just passed away. She's no longer with us,\" he said. Trump later spoke to her parents, a White House official told BBC's US partner CBS News.The US president previously said the attack underlined a major national security threat. The attack has prompted a range of announcements from the Trump administration aimed at curbing migration from Afghanistan and a number of other countries.Officials said they would suspend processing all immigration requests from Afghans, and re-examine green cards issued to individuals who migrated to the US from 19 countries.When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.On Thursday, Trump went on to vow to \"permanently pause migration\" to the US from all \"third world countries\", without providing details of his plan or naming which countries might be affected.Victim had volunteered to work at ThanksgivingMs Beckstrom had enlisted on 26 June 2023 and was assigned to the 863rd Military Police Company, 111th Engineer Brigade of the West Virginia Army National Guard. She had volunteered to work in Washington over the US holiday Thanksgiving, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News following the shooting.\"My baby girl has passed to glory,\" her father Gary Beckstrom posted on Facebook. The other National Guard member, Andrew Wolfe, is still in a \"critical condition\". \"We are doing everything we can to assist his family and to make sure that they have everything they need during this difficult time for them,\" Jeanine Pirro said on Friday morning.Both soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol in downtown Washington. More than 2,000 troops have been guarding the nation's capital since August, when the president began deploying troops to cities to tackle what he called \"out of control\" crime.Ms Beckstrom and Mr Wolfe were deployed in August, the West Virginia National Guard confirmed to BBC News.National Guard troops are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.The location of the shooting, just blocks from the White House, meant a number of law enforcement officials arrived quickly at the scene to treat the two victims and apprehend the gunman.The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanSuspect once worked alongside CIA in AfghanistanOfficials said Mr Lakanwal came to the US from Afghanistan in 2021, under a programme which offered special immigration protections to Afghans in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. At the time, the Taliban had taken back control of Afghanistan, raising fears of retribution against those who had co-operated with the US. Mr Lakanwal had helped guard US forces at Kabul airport in 2021 as thousands scrambled to escape Afghanistan as the Taliban swept back to power, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC.The suspect had been recruited to Unit 03 of the Kandahar Strike Force. His unit was known locally as Scorpion Forces, operating initially under the CIA but eventually for the Afghan intelligence department known as the National Directorate of Security.Mr Lakanwal was a GPS tracker specialist, the former commander told the BBC, describing him as a \"sporty and jolly character\".His whole unit was moved from Kandahar to Kabul five days before the Taliban entered the capital. They continued to protect the airport for another six days, before they too were airlifted out to the US.At a press conference on Thursday, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Mr Lakanwal's connection to US forces, saying the suspect \"had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces\", before moving to the US.CIA Director John Ratcliffe said he worked with the intelligence agency.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told CBS.Additional reporting by Hafizullah Maroof and Sayed Abdullah Nizami",

    "body": "16 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterTicket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday.From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery.The museum's security and management have faced criticism since a brazen heist in October, when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes.An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure.From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum.Non-EU visitors in groups with accredited guides will also have to pay €28 starting next year, the Louvre told the BBC.The price hike is expected to raise between €15m and €20m each year to support the museum's modernisation plans, it added.The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum.There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues.In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026.Macron also said the Mona Lisa would be moved to a new space to deal with overcrowding.Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo.The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros.Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics due to structural concerns.The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration.",

    "body": "A Tunisian court has handed jail terms to dozens of opposition leaders, lawyers and businessmen accused of attempting to overthrow the nation's president.Forty people including opposition leader Jawahar Ben Mbarek were handed sentences ranging from four to 45 years over the alleged conspiracy to oust President Kais Saied.Twenty of those charged have fled abroad and were sentenced in absentia, while others have been held in detention since 2023.Human rights groups have criticised the trial as politically motivated, characterising the prosecutions as an escalation of Saied's crackdown on dissent since he suspended Tunisia's parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree.Tunisian authorities argue the defendants, who include former head of intelligence Kamel Guizani, attemtpted to destabilise the country and topple Saied. Ben Mbarek and party leaders Issam Chebbi and Ghazi Chaouachi received jail terms of 20 years. All three have been detained since the 2023 crackdown.The maximum sentence, 45 years, was given to businessman Kamel Ltaif, while opposition politician Khyam Turki received a 35-year term.Ben Mbarek has been on hunger strike for over a month and was at risk of dying, news agency AFP reports, citing his sister and lawyer Dalila Ben Mbarek.Among those sentenced in absentia was politician and feminist Bochra Belhaj Hmida, as well as French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, human rights groups say.The final sentences were issued by an appeals court after the opposition figures were initially sentenced in April. Saied had branded them \"terrorists\".A lawyer for the defendants was quoted by Reuters as describing the trial as a \"farce\" that had the \"clear intent to eliminate political opponents\".Human rights groups have also been critical of the prosecutions.Sara Hashash, deputy regional director at Amnesty International, described the sentences as \"unjust\" and \"an appalling indictment of the Tunisian justice system\".She said that while three defendants were acquitted by the appeals court, it had increased others' sentences.\"The Court of Appeal has thereby also rubber stamped the government's use of the justice system to eliminate political dissent.\"After the initial ruling in April, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said the trial had raised \"serious concerns about political motivations\", and urged the Tunisian government to \"refrain from using broad national security and counter terrorism legislation to silence dissent\".On Saturday, thousands of Tunisians marched through the capital, Tunis, in an anti-government protest, accusing Saied of cementing a one-man rule through the judiciary and police.Saied was elected in 2019 after Tunisia emerged from the Arab Spring democracy movement.But the north African nation has since seen democratic backsliding and the re-imposition of aspects of authoritarian rule.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames FitzGeraldandMahfouz ZubaideAFP via Getty ImagesTens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the US withdrawal from the country in 2021Afghans living in the US have condemned Wednesday's \"deeply tragic\" deadly shooting attack in Washington DC, while stressing that the suspect - who moved to the US from Afghanistan four years ago - does not represent them.The alleged gunman, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered America under a programme that offered special immigration protections to Afghans who worked with the US in the wake of the its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in Wednesday's shooting, and a colleague, Andrew Wolfe, 24, is said to be fighting for his life.In response, US President Donald Trump has halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghans, ordered a review of green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries, and threatened a wider crackdown on migrants from what he calls \"third-world countries\".The Afghan Community Coalition of United States expressed its sympathy for families of the victims, calling for a \"comprehensive investigation\" but urging the US government not to delay or suspend Afghan immigration claims.\"Twenty years of Afghan-US partnership must not be forgotten,\" the coalition's statement said, nodding to the two-decade effort launched by the US in 2001 to overthrow Afghanistan's Taliban rulers and establish security in the country.Afghans living in America told the BBC they had been horrified by the Washington DC attack, which they emphasised was the act of just one person.Some spoke anonymously out of fear of reprisals by the Taliban, which took back control of Afghanistan following the US troop withdrawal in 2021.One of the Afghans, who made his move after the US withdrawal, described Wednesday's incident as \"deeply tragic\". He noted the timing ahead of Thanksgiving, and amid a \"highly charged political environment in Washington DC\".But he highlighted that the shooting was an \"individual criminal offence, not representative of a community\".\"Afghans in the United States are hardworking, tax paying members of society,\" he added. \"They remain grateful to America for the evacuation efforts during the crisis in Kabul.\"Thousands of Afghans scrambled to escape the country in 2021, many via Kabul, as the US withdrew its troops and the Taliban swept in. The suspect, Mr Lakanwal, is said by US officials to have had a relationship with US forces in Afghanistan while they were stationed there. He helped guard US forces at Kabul airport at the time of the withdrawal, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC.He came to the US the same year. He applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year, an official told the BBC's partner CBS News.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanAnother Afghan, who also moved to the US following the country's withdrawal from Afghanistan four years ago, labelled Wednesday's shooting \"really shocking\". He said he was praying for the families of the victims.He suspected that it was an \"individual crime which is committed without any support, participation and co-operation of others\", and said the attack \"should not be counted for the whole community\". Another Afghan man living in the US who spoke to the BBC said the shooting had been a \"very devastating event for all immigrants\", adding that the political reaction had left many people in a state of uncertainty.The situation felt more acute due to the threats in his country of origin, he said: \"For us Afghans there's problem for us in Afghanistan as well as here.\"Crystal Bayat, an Afghan human rights activist who moved to the US after 2021, said that despite having secured permanent residency, she still feared the US government could abruptly change course on accepting Afghan migrants.\"I have a fear every single day that what if the policy changes and they deport us from here?\" Ms Bayat told the Outside Source programme on BBC World Service.\"I hope President Trump changes his mind on this,\" Ms Bayat said. \"It is very dangerous to punish entire immigrant communities, or the people who stood shoulder to shoulder with the (American) people.\"She said there were families who were still in danger in Afghanistan due to their support of the US before the withdrawal.

    "body": "Peru's former President Pedro Castillo is among two of the South American nation's ex-leaders to be handed prison sentences in as many days.The left-wing leader was given 11 years in jail on Thursday for attempting to disband Peru's Congress and rule by decree in 2022. The gamble failed, and he was impeached and arrested.He was found guilty of \"conspiracy to commit rebellion\" by the Supreme Court, which handed down the sentence at the same time as convicting him.Castillo's sentence comes just a day after another former Peruvian president, Martín Vizcarra, was handed 14 years' in prison for bribe-taking while serving as a regional governor.The centrist politician, who had championed the fight against corruption during his term in office, was found guilty of taking bribes while governor of the Moquegua region between 2011 and 2014.Prosecutors said he received bribes worth more than $600,000 (£453,753) from construction companies who were seeking contracts for public works. Vizcarra has always maintained his innocence.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court acquitted Castillo of two other charges.Dubbed Peru's first poor president, Castillo, a former trade unionist and rural schoolteacher, won power in 2021 on a wave of frustration with conventional politics.His arrest and impeachment sparked deadly mass protests in 2022 among his working-class rural base. The protests were brutally repressed by security forces, leaving at least 50 dead.On Thursday, dozens of Castillo's supporters gathered outside the prison he is being held in to await the verdict, according to AFP.One supporter, Julia Buendia, told the news agency she still believed Castillo was innocent.Vizcarra and Castillo are the latest in a series of former Peruvian presidents to be jailed for misconduct. Ollanta Humala, who served as the nation's president between 2011 and 2016, was found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison earlier this year.Meanwhile, Alejandro Toledo, who governed it from 2001 to 2006, was sentenced last year to more than 20 years in prison for taking $35m (£26m) in bribes from a construction company.Peru has been beset by political crises in recent years.In October, clashes between anti-government protesters and riot police in the Peruvian capital, Lima, left one man and more than 100 injured.The protests came after the current President José Jerí was sworn in on an interim basis following the impeachment of his predecessor, Dina Boluarte.Boluarte was ousted by lawmakers on grounds of \"permanent moral incapacity\" amid soaring crime rates in Peru. Her presidency was overshadowed by several investigations, including a corruption inquiry dubbed \"Rolexgate\", concerning allegations she accepted Rolex watches as bribes.",

    "body": "Zelensky's top adviser resigns after Ukrainian anti-corruption raid on his home7 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor andJaroslav LukivReutersYermak has for years been Zelensky's closest aide and has played a key role in talks towards ending the warUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Yermak, a towering figure with enormous political influence, has been Zelensky's closest adviser throughout Russia's full-scale war, but has come under increasing pressure over an escalating scandal - even though he is not accused of any wrongdoing.Zelensky had recently appointed him to head crucial negotiations, with US President Donald Trump leading a new drive to end the Russia-Ukraine war.In a stark address to the nation outside his presidential office, Zelensky called for unity, warning: \"We risk losing everything: ourselves, Ukraine, our future.\"The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine for weeks, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position with the US at a delicate time.Ukraine, backed by its European allies, has sought to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Early on Friday Ukraine's two anti-corruption agencies raided Yermak's apartment in Kyiv's government quarters and the chief of staff said on social media that \"from my side there is full co-operation\".\"I'm grateful to Andriy that Ukraine's position on the negotiating track was always presented as required: it was always a patriotic position,\" Ukraine's president said during his video address in Kyiv.Zelensky said he would start consultations on Saturday on who would replace Yermak as his top adviser: \"When all the attention is focused on diplomacy and the defence in a war, inner strength is required.\"\"Russia wants Ukraine to make mistakes – there won't be any mistakes from our side. Our work continues, our fight continues. We have no right... to retreat, to quarrel [among ourselves].\"Yermak's departure from Ukraine's leading circle will come as a major blow for Zelensky, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as part of Trump's draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week and Russia's Vladimir Putin said on Friday he backed a Hungarian offer to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest.Putin has continued to promote Russia's maximalist demands to bring an end to the war. He claimed on Thursday that Russian forces had the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from the entire eastern Donbas region, including several strategically important cities under Ukrainian control.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Putin said.Hours before the raid on his flat, Yermak continued to explain his government's position as it comes under US pressure to make territorial concessions to Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\"As long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory,\" Yermak told The Atlantic website.Yermak, 54, admitted during his interview he was under \"enormous\" pressure to stand down, adding \"the case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\".AFP via Getty ImagesEarlier this week, Yermak took part in talks in Geneva with US Secretary of State Marco RubioUkraine's anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) did not explain why they searched his flat.In the past few weeks investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.Russian officials involved in Trump's draft peace plan have talked up the corruption claims, which have alarmed European Union allies. Ukraine is a candidate to join the EU and a report earlier this month highlighted doubts over \"commitment to its anti-corruption agenda\".Earlier this year Zelensky sought to curb the powers of the two anti-corruption agencies, but he was forced to backtrack almost immediately after widespread protests and objections from Kyiv's Western allies.Zelensky has already fired Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and several suspects have been detained in the burgeoning corruption scandal that has outraged public opinion because of allegations that money was diverted from key infrastructure projects vital for safeguarding Ukrainian power supplies.As winter starts in Ukraine, Russian attacks have already badly damaged its energy infrastructure and Ukrainians across the country have had to cope with only a few hours of electricity a day.One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has left the country in the wake of the corruption allegations.Mindich was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.In recent weeks Andriy Yermak's popularity has nose-dived and MPs from all parties, including his own, have been calling for his sacking, initially for what they saw as his inflated power for an unelected official, but more recently, the burgeoning corruption scandal.Recent polling suggested 70% of the public wanted him to resign.Zelensky and his now-former chief of staff became friends about 14 years ago, while the future president was a senior media executive and Yermak worked for him as a lawyer. Yermak was made chief of staff a year after Zelensky was elected president in 2019.On the first night of Russia's invasion, they appeared together with colleagues delivering a defiant video message outside the presidential office on Kyiv's Bankova Street, vowing to stay and fight.\"We are all here,\" Zelensky told Ukrainians. \"Our soldiers are here, the citizens are here and we are all here. We are defending our independence, and that's how it will continue.\"",

    "body": "Eight more arrested over fire in Hong Kong that killed at least 128 people10 hours agoHafsa Khalil'Solemn scenes': BBC reports from outside Hong Kong's scorched buildingsAt least 128 people are now known to have died in a devastating fire that engulfed multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong.Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovation works the blocks had been undergoing before the fire. Three others were detained earlier on manslaughter charges.The cause of the fire remains unclear, though officials said that polystyrene and protective netting placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its spread.A further 79 people were injured in the blaze - the city's deadliest in more than 70 years. Dozens remain missing.Police went into the buildings to start gathering evidence, after authorities said that an investigation would take place over the next three to four weeks.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said that those arrested in the corruption probe on Friday included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors. Some 2,311 firefighters worked to bring the fire under control after it spread across seven of Wang Fuk Court's eight apartment blocks. Firefighting efforts have now ceased. The fire was fully extinguished by 10:18 local time (02:18 GMT) on Friday, the fire department said at a news conference.It also said 89 bodies have yet to be identified, and 16 bodies remain inside the buildings.Meanwhile, crowds have been gathering at a nearby community hall that has been opened to families looking for missing loved ones. Relatives are being asked to help with the identification process by bringing in family photos.The Hong Kong government has also set up shelters and support centres for displaced residents. Groups of volunteers have been packing and organising supplies for those affected, including clothing and hygiene products.The blaze started at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, and by 18:22 local time it had been upgraded to the most serious category by fire officials.The fire department said the fire started at a lower level before moving upwards, and reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F).As a result, the blaze reignited in some places after being doused, they said.One former resident, who moved out earlier this year and only gave his surname, told the BBC: \"There was nothing we could do. Together we watched our homes burn gradually.\"The fire spread quickly across the separate blocks due to the presence of flammable netting and other materials on the outside of the buildings.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.Twelve other firefighters have also been injured, authorities said.Two Indonesian nationals who had been working on the buildings were also killed in the fire, a migrant charity said. Indonesian and Filipino workers are among those still unaccounted for.Indonesian worker Fita had been inside the building with her employer when she heard the fire brigade siren. She described it as scary and confusing, but added that she felt \"so grateful\" to be safe.\"But I'm concerned about friends I know... Usually we talk, and then I haven't met them [since the fire],\" she told news agency Reuters.Many of those in the shelters have been unwilling to speak to the media while reeling from the trauma.Shock has quickly shifted to anger in Hong Kong, as questions grow on who should be held accountable for the blaze.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.Meanwhile, one resident told the BBC that some of the alarms had been turned off by construction workers.Reports of residents' prior complaints over high renovation fees and whether the materials used complied with fire-safety regulations have also resurfaced and are circulating widely online. \"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" a police spokesperson said.ReutersReutersAs firefighters bring the blaze under control, the extent of the damage is yet to be assessedThick smoke billowed into the sky as bystanders watched onWang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse.Additional reporting by Martin Yip and Gemini Cheng in Hong Kong",

    "body": "Zambia's parliament has declared vacant the seat held by the daughter of the late ex-President Edgar Lungu, because of her continued absence in the wake of his death.Until her dismissal, Tasila Lungu had been the MP for Chawama constituency in the capital, Lusaka, representing the opposition Patriotic Front.In a message to her voters, she hinted she may try and challenge the decision saying: \"Where there is a will there is a way\".Her father died in June at the age of 68 in South Africa, where he was seeking medical treatment. This sparked a bitter legal row with his successor, President Hakainde Hichilema, who wanted to repatriate the body for a state funeral against the family's wishes.Ms Lungu has been attending court in South Africa challenging an earlier ruling in August that sided with Hichilema's government.The government had successfully argued in a Pretoria court that Hichilema must be able to attend the funeral because he is the head of state. Yet the Lungu family says the deceased gave instructions that the president \"should not be anywhere near\" his body.The former president's remains are still in South Africa as the impasse continues.Calls for her to lose her parliamentary seat first came from the ruling United Party for National Development. Brian Kambita MP questioned the speaker in July about whether Ms Lungu was still qualified to hold office because of her prolonged absence.Speaker Nelly Mutti initially granted Ms Lungu 14 days of compassionate leave to mourn her father and return to parliament when it resumed in September.However, she did not return within the given time.Parliament wrote to Ms Lungu again, but instead of resuming her duties, she requested more time until the court case over the burial was resolved.She also asked to be allowed to attend parliamentary sessions virtually.The matter was referred to the parliamentary committee on privileges and absences, which invited Ms Lungu to appear on 18 November. She did not attend that meeting either.The committee later suggested allowing her to represent her Chawama constituency online until her father's burial arrangements were concluded.But Ms Mutti rejected that proposal, saying virtual attendance could not replace physical representation.In a Facebook statement to her constituents on Friday, Ms Lungu thanked her \"wonderful team of councillors, community members and constituency staff who continue to coordinate and work tirelessly to serve you\".Elections for the seat are expected to be held within 90 days, despite Zambia holding a general election next August.The decision to declare Ms Lungu's vacant has been received with mixed feelings - some argue that she should be allowed the time to mourn her father, while others say her constituents have been deprived of representation.Independent MP Binwell Mpundu has accused the government of hypocrisy, saying it was wrong for them to claim solidarity with the Lungu family.\"You dragged [them] to court and today you nullify the parliamentary seat for the daughter who is mourning the late father. Hypocrites.\"",

    "body": "'This was preventable': Anger and unanswered questions after Hong Kong fire17 hours agoKoh EweandKelly NgVideo shows how fast fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseShock is giving way to anger in Hong Kong after a massive fire ripped through a densely populated subsidised housing estate on Wednesday, killing at least 128 people and critically injuring dozens.Authorities say substandard mesh and plastic sheets on the buildings' windows may have spread the blaze, which raged for more than a day.Firefighting operations have now ended, with dozens of residents still unaccounted for.Questions are mounting as to how the fire at Wang Fuk Court spread so rapidly and who is responsible, with many calling it a \"man-made disaster\".Three people in charge of renovating the blocks are under arrest for manslaughter, and authorities have launched a corruption inquiry.A post that has gone viral on social media in the wake of the blaze reads: \"It's not an accident.\"Several residents have revealed in interviews that the fire alarm did not sound when the fire broke out. Authorities said on Friday that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working properly. Kiko Ma, who owns an apartment at Wang Fuk Court, says the alarms had been turned off amid renovation works, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to get in and out of the building. Ms Ma lives in Canada with her family, but visits the Hong Kong apartment several times a year.\"This was preventable... A lot of people did not do their duties,\" the 33-year-old tells the BBC, claiming that the renovation firm used \"poor quality, flammable materials\".Residents often saw construction workers smoking and found cigarette butts along their window ledges, she adds.\"People kept asking what would happen if there was a fire. Everyone was very worried about this.\"Getty ImagesThe blaze spread rapidly and went on for more than a day in some blocksThis is Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years - already having surpassed the toll of the August 1962 inferno in the Sham Shui Po neighbourhood, which killed 44 people and displaced hundreds.Built in the 1980s, Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's north-eastern Tai Po district comprises eight 31-storey buildings, seven of which went up in flames. The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.Police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards. In a presser on Friday they attributed the rapid spread of the fire to styrofoam blocks placed outside the windows of the apartments, apparently to \"protect\" them from the debris and dust.Some experts also believe the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks helped fuel the inferno. Such scaffolding is an iconic sight across Hong Kong, and widely used in construction.Earlier this year, authorities announced plans to phase out bamboo in favour of sturdier, fire-resistant steel, citing bamboo's combustibility and deterioration over time.Getty ImagesHundreds of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters while emergency housing units are being allocated to someResidents at Wang Fuk Court had expressed unease about renovation plans when they were announced last year. Reports of those concerns have now resurfaced online, sparking accusations around a lack of transparency.Another homeowner who was abroad when the fire broke out said the plans were \"fundamentally shady\". \"[Those in charge] used small favours to encourage unsuspecting elderly residents to support their plans,\" they wrote in a comment on Instagram.Mr Lai, a sales associate who the BBC agreed to refer to by his last name only, says Wang Fuk Court residents had earlier questioned the high cost of renovation works. Calls from some residents to re-elect the estate's management committee went unheeded, he added. This week's fire is not an isolated incident, Mr Lai said, claiming that construction companies \"often prioritise cost efficiency\" over safety. He noted that a building in Hong Kong's Central district went up in flames last month after its bamboo scaffolding caught fire.\"When similar incidents happen, they raise the question of whether [there are] systemic weaknesses.\"Hong Kong authorities on Thursday ordered inspections of all housing estates undergoing \"major repairs\" to check for the \"safety of scaffolding and building materials\".",

    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

    "body": "A German company inadvertently embroiled in the Louvre Museum heist after one of its lifts was used in the theft is making the most of its free publicity - by launching a new advertising campaign.Werne-based firm Böcker this week published a social media post featuring the now famous image of its furniture ladder extending up to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo. \"When you need to move fast,\" reads a banner under the image. \"The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min - quiet as a whisper.\"Video has emerged of the alleged thieves escaping on the mechanical ladder after stealing €88m worth (£76m; $102m) of France's crown jewels on Sunday.Speaking to the AFP news agency on Wednesday, the company's managing director, Alexander Böcker, said when it became clear no one was injured in the heist they used \"a touch of humour\" to draw attention to the family-run business.\"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us,\" Mr Böcker said.\"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company.\" How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftStolen Louvre jewellery worth €88m, prosecutor saysCan France retrieve its priceless crown jewels - or is it too late?Reaction to Böcker's new campaign have been enthusiastic, with responses on social media including \"marketing genius\" and \"excellent, that is German quality\".\"Your messaging takes the crown,\" one commenter quipped.Mr Böcker told AFP he recognised his company's device from news reports, saying the machine was sold \"a few years ago to a French customer who rents this type of equipment in Paris and the surrounding area\".The alleged jewel thieves had arranged to have the machine demonstrated to them last week and had stolen it during the demonstration, he added.The thieves arrived at the Louvre on Sunday shortly after the museum opened its doors and visitors had started to file through its corridors.Within eight minutes, they made off with some of France's most valuable treasure belonging to former royalty or imperial rulers.Among the eight items stolen were diadems, necklaces, ear-rings and brooches adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.The Louvre reopened on Wednesday, a few days after what has been called France's most shocking theft.The museum's director admitted on Wednesday that the Louvre failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft and that CCTV around its perimeter was weak and \"aging\".\"We failed these jewels,\" Laurence des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from \"brutal criminals - not even the Louvre\".\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she added.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.Prosecutors said they believed the robbers acted under orders from a criminal organisation.",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterUS President Donald Trump has announced an immediate end to all trade negotiations with Canada over an advert critical of the tariffs he has imposed on the nation.The advert, sponsored by the government of Canada's province of Ontario, quoted Trump's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, an icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".Trump wrote on social media that the advert was \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\", adding that trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".His administration has imposed a 35% levy on many Canadian imports, as well as individual tariffs targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing. Ontario has been particularly hard-hit by these.Trump has allowed exemptions for goods that fall under a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that he negotiated during his first term.But Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has since his election earlier this year attempted to strike a deal that would ease the US tariffs.This has been complicated by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is one of the most vocal critics of the taxes levied on US firms buying Canadian products.In the minute-long advert published last week, Reagan's voice can be heard narrating over images that include the New York Stock Exchange and cranes adorned with both US and Canadian flags.The video excerpts a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focused on foreign trade.\"When someone says 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time,\" Reagan says in the advert.\"But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"The Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It said the advert \"misrepresents\" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks.The foundation said it was \"reviewing its legal options\".Trump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to \"interfere with\" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nation's products are legal.  The court's decision represents the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions collected in tariffs.The advert was run as part of a campaign worth $75m Canadian dollars (£40m; $54m) on mainstream TV channels in the US.In the post accompanying the advert, Ford wrote that \"we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada\".China's embassy in Washington also used a similar Reagan clip in a post on X to cast doubt on Trump's global tariffs earlier this year.Ontario is Canada's most populous province and its largest regional economy, and has suffered the most as a result of the US tariffs. Ford hit back at Trump's earlier tariff threat against Canada by saying he was willing to cut off power supply to the US.He had also described Washington's trade policies against Canada as having pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\", and called on US lawmakers to put pressure on Trump.Trump's sector-specific levies on Canadian goods include a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.The White House's global tariffs - particularly on steel, aluminium and cars - have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and putting pressure on businesses.Carney and Ford have not yet commented on Trump's announcement.It is the second time Trump has said he was ceasing trade talks with Canada, after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms earlier this year.When Canada rescinded the tax, the White House said Carney had \"caved\" to pressure from Trump.",

    "body": "The decades-old exemption that lets Trump fast-track White House rebuild17 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Bernd Debusmann JrGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump plans to knock down the entire \"existing structure\" of the White House East Wing to construct a new ballroom - despite previous assurances that the addition would \"not interfere with the current building\". The sight of demolitions has sparked an uproar from Democrats as well as conservation groups, including the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which wrote a letter calling on Trump to hold a public review process. As a former property developer, Trump has extensive experience of navigating planning restrictions, and has occasionally found himself on a collision course with campaigners objecting to his plans.Under a nearly-60-year-old law, the White House and several other notable buildings are exempt from a key historic preservation rule - though one expert told the BBC that presidents typically follow it anyway. Full story: Trump says 'existing structure' to be torn downWho is paying for Trump's new ballroom?Watch: How Trump's comments on East Wing demolition evolvedWhat does the law say?Trump's renovation appears to be the biggest in decades, but the president of the US does have the power to make those changes. And he is not the first to reconstruct the White House. Over the years, a host of presidents have made renovations, from a bowling alley to an indoor swimming pool. Under a law known as National Historic Preservation Act, federal agencies are required to examine the impact of any construction projects on historic properties. Specifically, Section 106 requires the agencies to undergo a review process, including getting input from the public. Then-President Lyndon B Johnson signed the law in 1966, after a period of rapid development in the US - including through federally-funded infrastructure projects - as concerns grew that cultural and historical landmarks were being destroyed. Why is the White House exempt? According to Section 107 of the act, three buildings and their grounds are exempt from the Section 106 review process: the White House, the US Capitol and the US Supreme Court building. In the past, however, typically presidents have voluntarily submitted their plans to the National Capital Planning Commission - which oversees federal building construction - before the construction project begins. Trump officials have not yet done so, but say they plan to, though the renovation has already begun. What's the precedent?Priya Jain, the chair of a heritage preservation committee at the Society of Architectural Historians, told the BBC that the process laid out by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was well established and would have been the \"best practice\" for Trump's East Wing renovation. These reviews - which can take years - involves discussions about programmatic requirements and potential alternatives.\"In this case, it would have been: do we need such a big ballroom? Should it be smaller?\" said Jain, a professor of architecture at Texas A&M University. \"Could it be an extension of the East Wing? Could it have been submerged?\"At stake, she said, is the \"history\" that the building contains. All the additions to the White House over time have added to how the public understands the building and the country at that point in time, she said. \"It's the memory,\" she said. \"The East Wing is 83 years old. It has assumed a historical importance of its own. I haven't seen much out there about how that was assessed.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterReutersChangpeng Zhao, founder of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has been pardoned by US President Donald Trump.Zhao, also known as \"CZ\", was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 after pleading guilty to violating US money laundering laws.Binance also pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay $4.3bn (£3.4bn) after a US investigation found it helped users bypass sanctions.The pardon reignited debate over the White House embrace of cryptocurrency as the Trump family's own investments in the industry have deepened.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution under the Biden administration part of a \"war on cryptocurrency\", pushing back on critics who said the pardon appeared motivated by Trump's personal financial interests. \"This was an overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration,\" she said, adding that the case had been \"thoroughly reviewed\". \"So the president wants to correct this overreach of the Biden administration's misjustice and he exercised his constitutional authority to do so.\"Binance had spent nearly a year pursuing a pardon for its former boss, who completed his four-month prison sentence in September 2024, the WSJ reported on Thursday.Its campaign came as Trump, who released his own coin shortly ahead of his inauguration in January, promised to take a friendlier approach to the industry than his predecessor.Since then, he has loosened regulations, sought to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve and pushed to make it easier for Americans to use retirement savings to invest in digital assets.Zhao, who stepped down as Binance chief executive in 2023, wrote on social media on Thursday that he was \"deeply grateful for today's pardon and to President Trump for upholding America's commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice\".The pardon lifts restrictions that had stopped Zhao from running financial ventures, but it's not yet clear whether it changes his standing with US regulators or his ability to lead Binance directly.In a statement Binance called the decision \"incredible news\". The exchange, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, remains the world's most popular platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.It did not respond to further questions about the conflict of interest claims.Before the pardon, Zhao's companies had partnered with firms linked to Trump on new digital-currency projects including Dominari Holdings, where his sons sit on the board of advisers and which is based in Trump Tower.The Wall Street Journal also previously reported representatives of the Trump family - which has its own crypto firm World Liberty Financial - had recently held talks with Binance.The Trump administration previously halted a fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, after his investments in the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. He has also pardoned founders of the crypto exchange BitMex, who also faced charges related to money laundering, and Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road, the dark web marketplace known as a place for drug trade.Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale wrote on social media that he loved Trump but the president had been \"terribly advised\" on pardons.\"It makes it look like massive fraud is happening around him in this area,\" he said.Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, blasted the decision in a statement as a \"kind of corruption\".Asked about the decision to pardon Zhao on Thursday, Trump appeared not to not know who he was.\"Are you talking about the crypto person?\" he asked, later saying he had granted the pardon at the \"request of a lot of good people\".When US officials announced the Binance guilty plea in 2023, they said Binance and Zhao were responsible for \"wilful violations\" of US laws, which had threatened the financial system and national security.\"Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,\" said then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\"Its wilful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.\"Zhao stepped down as Binance chief executive as part of the resolution of the case, writing at the time that resigning was \"the right thing to do\". \"I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,\" he said.Additional reporting by Bernd Debussman Jr",

    "body": "X-ray tables, high-tech glasses, NBA players: How a poker scheme allegedly stole millions9 hours agoNardine SaadBBCCelebrities, professional sports stars and wealthy gamblers sat at a table hoping to win big in a game of Texas Hold 'Em.But they didn't know it was nearly impossible. They were \"fishes\" allegedly being targeted by the mafia in an elaborate poker gambling scheme that included X-ray card tables, secret cameras, analysers in chip trays and sunglasses and contact lenses that could read their hand. In what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these \"unwitting\" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m.The scheme, which US prosecutors described as \"reminiscent of a Hollywood movie\", was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Costra Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones. FBI director Kash Patel called it a \"mind-boggling\" fraud scheme that cheated victims in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other US cities. Arrests in the scheme were announced on Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, in which professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds. The underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Luchesse and Genovese. A cut of the profits, prosecutors say, helped fund their criminal enterprise. Former professional athletes, described by prosecutors as \"face cards\", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing. Lured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, \"unwitting victim\" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege. Unbeknownst to the lured-in players - referred to in the scheme as a \"fish\" - everyone surrounding them was in on the elaborate scam - from the players to the dealers, even the technology used to shuffle the deck and count the chips, according to a lengthy federal indictment. Sophisticated wireless technology was also used to deceive the players during the games, most commonly in Texas Hold 'Em.What we know about gambling arrestsUS Department of JusticeA rigged card-shuffling machine was also used in the plot, prosecutors sayThe technology was everywhere - an X-ray table that read any face-down card, analysers inside chip trays, a rigged shuffling machine that read cards and predicted who would have the best hand, and pre-marked cards that allowed those wearing special sunglasses and contact lenses to read what was in everyone's hands. Secretive cameras - built into tables and light fixtures - also helped convey information to those helping in the plot, authorities say. Then there was also a sophisticated method of communicating and rigging the game, prosecutors allege. Information from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator - called an \"operator\" by prosecutors - who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - who prosecutors call a \"quarterback\" or \"driver\". US Department of JusticeProsecutors say an X-ray poker machine was employed to read facedown cardsThat person would then secretly signal to others, prosecutors allege, effectively stealing money and making it impossible for victims to win. Authorities estimate that each game would leave a victim out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Prosecutors say the defendants allegedly laundered the funds from the scheme through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges and shell companies. A cut of the profits went to those who helped in the plot, prosecutors say, and some allegedly went to fund the mafia's criminal enterprise. \"This alleged scheme wreaked havoc across the nation, exploiting the notoriety of some and the wallets of others to finance the Italian crime families,\" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia.Billups, who was accused of being a face card in the fixed card games, was arrested in Portland and was placed on leave by the NBA. The Portland Trail Blazers said in a statement that they were aware of the allegations involving their head coach and were \"fully co-operating with the investigation\".Jones was arrested in relation to both the poker and NBA injuries scheme. He is charged with two counts each of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.",

The arrests are part of a sweeping investigation into illegal gambling that produced two indictments, the FBI said — one into players who are allegedly faking injuries to influence betting odds, and another involving an illegal poker ring tied to organised crime.Here is what we know about the cases.What are the allegations? FBI Director Kash Patel described the allegations to reporters as \"mind-boggling\".They include indictments in two major cases, officials said, both involving fraud.The first case is called \"operation nothing but bet,\" in which players and associates allegedly used insider information to manipulate wagers on major sports betting platforms.Follow live updatesIn some cases, players altered their performance or took themselves out of games to ensure those bets were paid out, according to New York City police commissioner Jessica Tisch. Those bets amounted to tens of thousands of dollars in profits.The second case is more complex in nature, officials said, and involved four of the five major crime families in New York as well as professional athletes.The accused in that case are alleged to have participated in a scheme to rig illegal poker games and steal millions of dollars.They did so using \"very sophisticated\" technology including off-the-shelf shuffling machines, special contact lenses and eye glasses to read pre-marked cards, according to authorities. They also used an X-ray table that could read cards that were face down. The victims were allegedly lured to play in these games with former professional athletes, who acted as \"face cards\" in the scheme. The victims were unaware that everyone, including the dealer and the other players, were in on the scam. Authorities said they began probing these poker games in 2019, spanning multiple locations including the Hamptons, Las Vegas, Miami and Manhattan.The accused allegedly laundered profits via bank wires and crypto currencies. They are also alleged to have committed acts of violence, including a robbery at gunpoint and extortion against victims.Both schemes amounted to tens of millions of dollars in theft and robbery across several years and 11 states, authorities said.FBI director announces schemes involving NBA players and Mafia familiesWhich players have been arrested?All in all, authorities say 34 defendants were indicted on charges related to the two fraud cases.Six were charged in the first case of players allegedly faking injuries to influence betting odds, including Miami Heat player Rozier. New York police commissioner Jessica Tisch said that in March 2023, Rozier, then playing for the Charlotte Hornets, allegedly let others close to him know that he planned to leave a game early with a supposed injury.Members of the group then used that information to place fraudulent bets and cash out big, she said. Commissioner Tisch said on Thursday after Rozier's arrest that his \"career is already benched, not for injury but for integrity\".Former NBA player Damon Jones was also arrested. He is said to have been involved in two games that were allegedly part of the scheme, when the Los Angeles Lakers met the Milwaukee Bucks in February 2023, and a January 2024 game between the Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder.Authorities identified a total of seven NBA games between February 2023 and March 2024 that were part of the case:9 February, 2023 – Los Angeles Lakers v Milwaukee Bucks23 March, 2023 – Charlotte Hornets v New Orleans Pelicans24 March, 2023 – Portland Trail Blazers v Chicago Bulls6 April, 2023 – Orlando Magic v Cleveland Cavaliers15 January, 2024 – Los Angeles Lakers v Oklahoma City Thunder26 January, 2024 – Toronto Raptors v Los Angeles Clippers20 March, 2024 – Toronto Raptors v Sacramento KingsThe second case related to illegal poker games involved a total of 31 defendants, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Billups, who was inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame last year.Authorities said three of the accused were charged in both cases.Thirteen members and associates of the Bonanno, Genovese and Gambino crime families in New York were also indicted in the illegal poker case.The charges include robbery, extortion, wire fraud, bank fraud and illegal gambling.The defendants have been arrested and are due to appear in court later on Thursday, authorities said. They are expected to be arraigned in a Brooklyn, New York, court at a later date. What has the NBA said about the allegations?In a statement on Thursday, the NBA said it is in the process of reviewing the federal indictments that were announced and that it is co-operating with authorities.The league added that Rozier and Billups are being placed \"on immediate leave\" from their teams. \"We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,\" the statement said.Who are New York's notorious 'Five Families'?Authorities said the alleged scheme involved four of the five well-known crime families of New York.The Five Families - the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese - have ruled the city's Italian American mafia since 1931.Major mob takedowns reduced the prevalence of mafia activity in the 1990s, aided by the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and then-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. But, as Thursday's indictments show, the mafia has not entirely gone away.The Five Families are part of the larger American-Sicilian mafia operation known as La Cosa Nostra, which translates to \"this thing of ours\", and the members often work closely with their counterparts in Sicily.On the Italian side, the gangsters consider New York City to be a \"gym\" where their members go to be toughened up, criminology professor and modern organised crime expert Anna Sergi, previously told BBC.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East correspondent, in JerusalemAFPThe bodies of the dead Palestinians were transferred by the Red Cross in refrigerated lorriesOut of a single room, with no DNA testing facilities or cold storage units of its own, the forensics team at Gaza's Nasser hospital face the challenges brought by peace.Over the past eleven days, 195 bodies have been returned to Gaza by Israeli authorities, in exchange for the bodies of 13 Israeli hostages, under the terms of Donald Trump's ceasefire deal.Photographs released by Gaza's medical authorities show some of the bodies badly decomposed, and arriving in civilian clothes or naked except for underwear, some with multiple signs of injury. Many have their wrists tied behind their backs, and doctors say some bodies arrived blindfolded or with cloth roped around their necks.The forensic team at Nasser hospital are working with almost no resources to answer vast questions about torture, mistreatment and identity.The head of the unit, Dr Ahmed Dheir, said one of their biggest limitations is a lack of cold storage space. The bodies arrive in Gaza thoroughly frozen and can take several days to thaw out, ruling out even basic identification methods like dental history, let alone any deeper investigation or post-mortem (autopsy).\"The situation is extremely challenging,\" he said. \"If we wait for the bodies to thaw, rapid decomposition begins almost immediately, putting us in an impossible position [because] we lose the ability to examine the remains properly. So the most viable method is to take samples and document the state of the bodies as they are.\"Dr Ahmed Dheir says the lack of cold storage space means he and his colleagues have little time to examine the remains properlyThe BBC has viewed dozens of photographs of the bodies, many of them shared by Gaza's health authorities, others taken by colleagues on the ground.We spoke to several of those involved in examining the bodies in Gaza, as well as families of the missing, human rights groups, and Israeli military and prison authorities.We also spoke to three forensic experts outside the region, including one specialising in torture, to educate ourselves about the medical processes involved in this kind of investigation – all agreed that there were questions that were difficult to answer without post-mortems.Dr Alaa al-Astal, one of the forensic team at Nasser hospital, said some of the bodies arriving there showed \"signs of torture\", such as bruises and marks from binding on the wrists and ankles.\"There were extremely horrific cases, where the restraint was so tight that blood circulation to the hands was cut off, leading to tissue damage and clear signs of pressure around the wrists and ankles,\" he said.\"Even around the eyes, when the blindfolds were removed, you could see deep grooves - imagine how much force that took. The pressure left actual marks where the blindfold had been tied.\"Dr Astal also mentioned the loose cloths tied around the necks of some bodies as needing further investigation.\"In one case, there was a groove around the neck,\" he said. \"To determine whether the death was due to hanging or strangulation, we needed to perform a post-mortem, but because the body was frozen, it was not dissected.\"The bodies are bring brought to a temporary facility at Nasser hospital in Khan YounisSameh Yassin Hamad, a member of the Hamas-run government committee responsible for receiving the bodies, said there were signs of bruising and blood infiltration indicating that the bodies had been severely beaten before death. He also said there were stab wounds on the chest or face of some of them.Some of the images we saw from the unit clearly show deep indentations or tightly-fastened cable-ties on the wrists and arms and ankles. One photograph appears to show the bruising and abrasion that would confirm that ties had been used while the person was still alive.Other bodies showed only deep indentation marks, meaning a post-mortem would be needed to determine whether the ties had been used before or after death. Cable-ties are sometimes used when transporting bodies in Israel.When we asked Israel's military about the evidence we gathered, it said it operates strictly in accordance with international law.We showed the photographs we were given to the outside forensic experts. The images represent a fraction of the bodies transferred to Gaza by the Red Cross.All three experts said that some of the markings raised questions about what had happened, but that it was difficult to reach concrete conclusions about abuse or torture without  post-mortems.\"What is happening in Gaza is an international forensic emergency,\" said Michael Pollanen, a forensic pathologist and professor at the University of Toronto. \"Based upon images like this, there is an imperative for complete medical autopsies.  We need to know the truth behind how deaths occurred, and the only way to know the truth is to do autopsies.\"But even with limited forensic data, doctors at Nasser hospital say the routine cuffing of wrists behind the body rather than in front, along with the marks observed on the limbs, points to torture.\"When a person is naked, with their hands tied behind their back, and visible restraint marks on their wrists and ankles, it indicates that they died in that position,\" Dr Dheir told us. \"This is a violation of international law.\"And there is strong evidence to suggest widespread abuse of detainees - including civilians - in Israeli custody in the months after the war began in October 2023, particularly in the military facility of Sde Teiman.Unidentified bodies are being buried in a mass grave once forensic exams have been carried out\"At least in the first eight months of the war, the detainees from Gaza were cuffed behind their backs, and had their eyes covered, 24 hrs, 7 days a week, for months,\" said Naji Abbas, head of the Prisoners and Detainees Programme at the Israeli human rights organisation, Physicians for Human Rights (PHRI).\"We know that people developed serious infections on their skin, hands and legs because of the cuffs.\"We have spoken to several people who worked at Sde Teiman over the past two years, who confirm that detainees were cuffed hand and foot – even while undergoing medical treatments, including surgery.One medic who worked there said he had campaigned to loosen the cuffs, and that the treatment of detainees there was \"dehumanisation\".But many of those detained during the Gaza war are held as unlawful combatants, without charge.One complication for doctors at Nasser Hospital now is determining which of the returned bodies are Hamas fighters killed in combat, which are civilians and which are detainees who died in Israeli custody.Some of the bodies returned by Israel are still wearing Hamas headbands or military boots, but doctors say most are either naked or in civilian clothing, making it difficult to distinguish their role, interpret their injuries, and assess human rights violations.Photographs seen by the BBC show mostly naked or decomposed bodies. One dressed in civilian clothing and trainers has what officials say are two small bullet wounds in his back.AFPOfficials at Nasser hospital have been showing pictures of the bodies and any personal items to relatives of missing peopleSameh Yassin Hamad, from Gaza's Forensics Committee, said that Israel had sent back identification with only six of the 195 bodies it had returned – and that five of those names turned out to be wrong.\"Since these bodies were held by the Israeli authorities, they will have full data about them,\" said Dr Dheir. \"But they haven't shared that information with us through the Red Cross. We were sent DNA profiles for around half the total number of dead, but have not received any details about the dates or circumstances of death, or the time or place of detention.\"We asked Israel's army about the details in this report, including striking allegations by Gaza's forensic team that Israel had removed single fingers and toes from the bodies for DNA testing.Israel's military said \"all bodies returned so far are combatants within the Gaza Strip.\"  It denied tying any bodies prior to their release.A spokeswoman for the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Shosh Bedrosian, on Wednesday described the reports from Gaza as \"just more efforts to demonise Israel\" and suggested the media focus instead on the experience of Israeli hostages.Somaya Abdullah was at the hospital looking for her sonAs families of those missing gather at the hospital gates, Dr Dheir and his staff are under intense pressure to identify the dead and provide answers about what happened to them.So far, only some 50 bodies have been positively identified – mostly through basic details like height, age and obvious previous injuries.  Another 54 have been buried, unidentified and unclaimed, because of intense pressure on space at the unit.Many families of the missing attended the burial of the unnamed dead this week, just in case one of them was theirs.\"Honestly, it's hard to bury a body when you don't know whether it's the right one or not,\" said Rami al-Faraa, still searching for his cousin.\"If there was [DNA] testing, we'd know where he is – yes or no,\" said Houwaida Hamad, searching for her nephew.  \"My sister would know if the one we're burying is really her son or not.\"Donald Trump's ceasefire deal has brought some relief for Gaza, but little closure for the families of most of those missing, left burying a body in place of a brother, husband or son.",

    "body": "New images show Israeli control line deeper into Gaza than expected19 hours agoBenedict Garman, Emma Pengelly and Matt Murphy,BBC VerifyBBCThe Israeli military is exerting control over more of Gaza than expected from the ceasefire deal with Hamas, a BBC Verify analysis has found.Under the first stage of the deal, Israel agreed to retreat to a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. The divide was marked by a yellow line on maps released by the military and has become known as the \"Yellow Line\".But new videos and satellite images show that markers placed by Israeli troops in two areas to mark the divide have been positioned hundreds of metres deeper inside the strip than the expected withdrawal line.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz - who instructed troops to place the yellow blocks as markers - warned that anyone crossing the line \"will be met with fire\". There have already been at least two deadly incidents near the boundary line.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not address the allegations when approached by BBC Verify, stating simply that: \"IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground.\"There has been a consistent lack of clarity as to where exactly the boundary will be imposed, with three separate maps posted by the White House, Donald Trump and the Israeli military in the run up to the ceasefire agreement which came into force on 10 October. On 14 October the IDF issued the latest version marking the Yellow Line on their online map, which is used to communicate its position to people in Gaza.But in the north, near the al-Atatra neighbourhood, drone footage from the IDF showed that a line of six yellow blocks were up to 520m further inside the Strip than would have been expected from the IDF maps.Footage geolocated by BBC Verify showed workers using bulldozers and diggers to move the heavy yellow blocks and place them along the coastal al-Rashid road.A similar situation was visible in southern Gaza, where a satellite image taken on 19 October showed 10 markers erected near the city of Khan Younis. The line of blocks ranges between 180m-290m inside the Yellow Line set out by the IDF.If these two sections of boundary were typical of how the markers were being placed along the entirety of the line then Israel would be exerting control over a notably larger area than expected from the ceasefire agreement.Multiple analysts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the blocks were intended to create a \"buffer zone\" between Palestinians and IDF personnel. One expert said the move would be consistent with a long-term \"strategic culture\" which seeks to insulate Israel from nearby territories it does not fully control.\"This gives the IDF space to manoeuvre and create a 'kill zone' against potential targets,\" Dr Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London, said.\"Potential targets can be engaged before they reach the IDF perimeter. It is a bit like no man's land that does not belong to anyone – and Israel tends to take that territory from the opponent's chunk not its own.\"Three experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disparity between the markers and the IDF map was an intentional design to warn civilians they are \"approaching an area of increased risk\".Noam Ostfeld, an analyst with the risk consultancy Sibylline, said that some blocks \"seem to be positioned near roads or walls, making them easier to spot\".But a post to X by the Israeli defense minister seemed to suggest that the yellow blocks marked the actual line, warning that \"any violation or attempt to cross the line will be met with fire\".There is already confusion among Gazans over areas where it is safe to go.Abdel Qader Ayman Bakr, who lives near the temporary boundary in the eastern part of Gaza City's Shejaiya district, told the BBC that, despite promises from Israel of clear markings, he had seen none put in place.\"Each day, we can see Israeli military vehicles and soldiers at a relatively close distance, yet we have no way of knowing whether we are in what is considered a 'safe zone' or 'an active danger zone',\" he said.\"We are constantly exposed to danger, especially since we are forced to remain here because this is where our home once stood.\"Since the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF has reported a number of instances of people crossing the Yellow Line. On all occasions the IDF said it fired upon those involved.BBC Verify has obtained and geolocated footage showing the aftermath of one incident on 17 October, which the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said killed 11 civilians - including women and children all reportedly from the same family. The agency said the Palestinians' vehicle was targeted by Israel after crossing the Yellow Line east of Gaza City in the Zeitoun neighbourhood.The footage showed rescue workers inspecting the burnt out remnants of a vehicle and covering a nearby badly-mangled body of a child with a white sheet. BBC Verify geolocated the video to a spot around 125m over the Yellow Line marked on maps by the IDF.The IDF said warning shots were fired towards a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the line. The statement added when the vehicle failed to stop troops opened fire \"to remove the threat\".Israel Defense Forces (IDF)Meanwhile, the legal status of the boundary has also been questioned.\"Israel's obligations under the law of armed conflict do not cease even for those breaching the Yellow Line,\" said Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, professor of Public International Law at the University of Bristol.\"It can only target enemy fighters or those directly participating in hostilities, and in so doing it must not cause excessive civilian harm.\"In a statement, an Israeli military spokesperson said: \"IDF troops under the Southern Command continue to operate to remove any threat to the troops and to defend the civilians of the State of Israel.\"They added that the concrete blocks are \"being placed every 200 metres\".Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.At least 68,280 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Additional reporting by Erwan Rivault, Lamees Altalebi and Maha El Gaml",

However, analysts said it could also be seen as a political purge.Their removal marked one of the Chinese Communist Party's largest public crackdowns on the military in decades.For months, the Central Military Commission has signalled that it would conduct a crackdown. In July, it issued new guidelines calling for the elimination of \"toxic influence\" in the military and listing out \"iron rules\" for cadres.The crackdown follows smaller-scale public purges of other military officials in recent years, including former defence ministers Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu.Following his promotion Zhang, 67, will serve with another more senior vice chair, Zhang Youxia, on the Central Military Commission.He is a general from the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force and has been serving as deputy secretary of the Central Military Commission's anti-corruption arm.He comes from the central province of Shaanxi and joined the army in 1978.Getty ImagesThe appointment comes after one of the Chinese Communist Party's largest public crackdowns on the military in decades.During the four-day meeting that ended Thursday, the party's Central Committee also approved a new five-year-plan – a broad document to guide its priorities.The plan emphasised \"scientific and technological self-reliance\", something Chinese tech companies will need if the Trump Administration continues to restrict access to computer chips and advanced software.The document also called for \"accelerating the green transition\" and \"modernising defence\" as well as boosting domestic consumption to make up for lost export revenue, during a time of geopolitical uncertainty.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLana Lam and Helen Livingstone,in SydneyFour servicewomen have launched a landmark class action lawsuit against the Australian military alleging sexual abuse, harassment and discrimination.Lawyers said they expected thousands of women to join the case against the Australian Defence Force (ADF), which was filed in the Federal Court on Friday.Claims by the four women leading the lawsuit - whose names are withheld for legal reasons - include being forcibly pinned to a wall before being groped, and waking up naked and bruised after a party with male officers.An ADF spokesperson said it was developing a sexual misconduct prevention strategy and there was \"no place for sexual violence\" in the army.All women who served between 12 November 2003 and 25 May 2025 are eligible to join the suit, lodged by law firm JGA Saddler. One of the lead applicants was a member of the air force who was one of two women in a building of about 200 people. She alleged she was subject to hostile and sexist comments, inappropriate conversations, as well as being shown unsolicited pornographic photos.She also alleged her sergeant told her \"women shouldn't be paid as much as men because they are not as strong\".Another of the four applicants, who joined the navy, said she was subject to lewd comments throughout her training and unwanted touching. She also alleged that while on duty abroad she was grabbed and kissed by her a colleague who resisted her attempts to get away.A major report into suicide among Australian veterans last year found that about 800 reports of sexual assault were made within the ADF between 2019 and 2024.It noted that there was an estimated under-reporting rate for sexual assault of 60% in the ADF and that that was \"only a subset of all forms of sexual misconduct that occur\". \"The threat of war often isn't the biggest safety fear for female ADF personnel, it is the threat of sexual violence in their workplace,\" said lawyer Josh Aylward from JGA Saddler.\"They have signed up to defend their country, not to fight off fellow ADF personnel on a daily basis, all while simply trying to do their job.\"An ADF spokesperson acknowledged there was \"work to be done\" and added that \"all defence personnel have a right to be respected and deserve to have a positive workplace experience in the ADF\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondentBBCA BBC investigation last year found that Germany was being used to store boats and engines used in small-boat crossingsThere are growing doubts that Germany will tighten its laws this year to make it easier to prosecute small-boat smugglers, the BBC has learned.Facilitating people-smuggling is not technically illegal in Germany if it is to a third country, which the UK is after Brexit.Germany has agreed to close the loophole by the end of 2025.But now the Interior Ministry in Berlin says only that it intends to introduce the bill to the German parliament, or Bundestag, by that date – and has stopped short of guaranteeing a timeline for its final approval.A spokesperson would not be drawn on whether time was running out ahead of the Christmas break – but told the BBC that the federal government had \"no influence\" over parliamentary process once a bill had been agreed by cabinet.Some UK officials are increasingly unsure whether enough space is left in the Bundestag's calendar this year, though the Home Office insists it has not been told of any setbacks by Berlin.A staffer at the Bundestag, who is tracking the proposal, said there may \"theoretically\" be a sufficient window but admitted it did not appear to be a government priority.It comes as France is backing away from a recent commitment to intervene more forcefully at sea to stop small boats,  according to multiple sources contacted by the BBC.France retreats from pledge to intercept migrant boatsThe UK's Labour government is under pressure to show that its emphasis on closer international collaboration – striking deals with other countries – can work as an effective strategy to tackle small boat crossings.Last year, a BBC investigation exposed how Germany is used as a hub by small-boat smugglers to store dinghies that are then used for illegal English Channel crossings.‘Death trap’ Channel boats traded by smugglers in German city - BBC undercoverBerlin's subsequent commitment to adapt the law – and make such activities more explicitly illegal – was lauded as \"further evidence\" by the UK that its approach was \"bearing fruit\".Any delay is likely to spark frustration in the UK, as it has long pressed Berlin to tighten its rules and enforcement.STEFAN ROUSSEAU/POOL/AFPSir Keir Starmer (L) and Germany's Friedrich Merz signed a landmark treaty last JulyA legal provision has been drafted to further expand \"criminal liability for cross-border human smuggling to the United Kingdom\", according to the Interior Ministry in Berlin.However, the ministry has not confirmed that the plans have yet to be approved by Cabinet - a necessary step before being laid before parliament.The proposals are not widely known about in Germany, where the domestic debate focuses on internal levels of immigration.There is also some scepticism in Berlin about how much difference the law change will make in meeting UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's repeated pledge to \"smash the gangs\".Germany's announcement that it would change the law nearly a year ago came just months after the BBC's investigation.The following July, alongside a landmark treaty, the UK and Germany said that the aim was to for the Bundestag to adopt the legislation by the end of 2025.Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the BBC at the time that he believed that not much time would be needed to enact the change after the summer recess.It will give German prosecutors \"more tools to tackle the supply and storage of dangerous small boats equipment\", according to the UK government.Currently, investigators have to rely on \"collateral crime\" such as violence or money laundering – or have used judicial orders from other countries to carry out raids.A UK Home Office spokesperson said: \"We welcome the commitment from Germany to make it illegal to facilitate illegal migration to the UK.\"\"The law change is expected to be adopted by the end of the year,\" they said, while adding that the process was a matter for the German government.",

    "body": "14 hours agoFavour NunooBBC Africa, AccraGhana's former First Lady Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings has died at the age of 76.She was the widow of Ghana's longest-serving leader, Jerry John Rawlings, who died five years ago.He led two coups before twice being elected president in multiparty polls.Social media is awash with tributes to the former first lady, politician and women's rights advocate, who Ghanaian presidential spokesperson Felix Kwakye Ofosu said had died after a short illness on Thursday morning.Her family visited President John Mahama in the afternoon to officially notify him of her death. The president leads the National Democratic Congress (NDC) party, founded by Jerry Rawlings after he took power.Agyeman-Rawlings also had political ambitions - but lost out in her bid to become the NDC's presidential candidate in 2012.  Why Jerry Rawlings divided opinion in GhanaJerry Rawlings: Remembering Ghana's 'man of the people'As first lady, she founded the 31st December Women's Movement to empower women and teach them how to earn money to develop their communities. It was named after the date of her husband's second coup, which took place in 1981.Born in November 1948, Agyeman-Rawlings came from a middle-class family and grew up in the city of Cape Coast.She met her future husband when she became a boarder at the prestigious Achimota School in the capital, Accra.Unlike her husband, she went on to get a university education, studying art and textiles.Jerry Rawlings joined the air force and earned the rank of flight lieutenant in 1978 - a year after the couple were married.It was not long afterwards that Rawlings, aged 32, took power, with his wife said to be one of his most important advisers.Young, glamourous and charismatic, they proved a dynamic if controversial duo in the West African nation. Together they had four children and their eldest - Dr  Zanetor Agyeman-Rawlings - has gone into politics serving as an NDC MP.The former first lady's women's group, initially regarded as an arm of the NDC, is credited with significantly helping women across the country - especially in poorer areas.Her advocacy also influenced national policy and she played a key role in shaping a law in 1989 that guaranteed inheritance rights for women and children.She is also credited with contributing to provisions for gender equality in Ghana's 1992 constitution, which saw the return of multiparty politics.Ghana's parliament has adjourned to mark the former first lady's death as the country prepares to officially mourn one of its most iconic political figures and one who fought for the inclusion of women in politics.",

    "body": "1 day agoOlga Ivshina, Anastasia Platonova and Yaroslava Kiryukhina,BBC RussianHead of Belgorod region press officeFirefighters trying to put out a vehicle fire after a drone strike on Belgorod, RussiaResidents of Russia's Belgorod region say blackouts, air-raid sirens and the sound of gunfire aimed at incoming Ukrainian drones are becoming increasingly common, as Kyiv retaliates against repeated bombardments of its cities with cross-border strikes of its own.\"It's so loud and so terrifying,\" says Nina, a Belgorod resident who asked us to change her name.\"I was coming back from the clinic when a siren went off. As usual, I received Telegram alerts about a drone attack. Then bursts of automatic gunfire broke out, I ran into a nearby courtyard and tried to hide under an arch,\" she recalls.\"The next day it all happened again - air defence fire, automatic gunfire, explosions.\"The number of Ukrainian drone attacks on the Belgorod region has increased nearly fourfold since the start of 2025, according to BBC News Russian analysis based on data from local authorities.In September, more than 4,000 Ukrainian drones were recorded in the Belgorod region, compared with around 1,100 in January 2025. In one of the biggest strikes last month, the region was attacked with more than 260 drones, according to the governor. There has also been an increase in missile attacks since the summer.Ukraine continues to suffer far greater losses from Russia's near-daily missile and drone strikes, which routinely kill civilians and leave cities across the country without power and heat. At least seven people were killed, including two children, in Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities overnight into Wednesday, and there are fears that the coming winter may be the harshest yet for Ukraine.DSNS UkraineSeveral people were killed on Wednesday in Russian strikes on Kyiv and the surrounding regionUkrainian authorities say the recent surge of attacks on Belgorod, some of which have caused huge blackouts, is a direct result of Russia's latest onslaught on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\"Maybe they should stop being too comfortable there in Belgorod?\" Zelensky said earlier this month. \"They must understand: if they want to leave us without power, then we will do the same\".Belgorod region is a key logistics corridor and staging hub for Russian forces near the border with Ukraine. It is also a regular point of origin for artillery and short-range drone strikes.Although there were local electricity outages in smaller towns in the region earlier in the war, the city of Belgorod was largely unaffected by power cuts until this autumn.Local student Ekaterina (not her real name) told the BBC she was at home in the city on the evening of 28 September, when notifications started appearing on her phone: \"Missile alert! Take shelter!\"The sound of howling sirens followed, and the lights in her flat started flickering.\"We ran to the corridor, because the explosions started almost immediately. They were very loud. The lights blinked and went out,\" Ekaterina recalls.Neighbourhoods of Belgorod lost power after a missile strike and power cut in OctoberMissiles had hit the main Belgorod heat and power plant and a substation, local Telegram channels reported.And while the city centre had its electricity back relatively quickly, some in the suburbs were left without power until morning. Across the region, around 77,000 people, or 5% of the population, still had no electricity the next day.\"While you're in the office in the centre, you wouldn't necessarily notice that there was a blackout. But when you're going home it's like entering a whole different world,\" another Belgorod resident Natalya (not her real name) tells the BBC. \"Complete darkness outside. Apartment blocks are without power, the shops are dark too. As you ride through the darkness, it's hard to tell where your stop is - you can't see anything\".Another big blackout came less than a week later.Authorities admit they do not have the capacity to provide everyone with back-up generators and have called on residents to buy their own.\"But what are we suppose to fuel them with, given the fuel crisis?\" Maria, an elderly resident who also asked to change her name, tells the BBC.More than half of Russia's regions, including Belgorod, have been affected by petrol and diesel shortages, due to increased Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries.Surge in Ukrainian attacks on oil refineries sparks Russian fuel shortages\"And the prices for generators have shot up as well,\" Maria says.Ukraine has increased production of its \"Darts\" drone - lightweight and cheap models that can carry a 4kg (9lb) warhead - and many Belgorod residents say this is the reason the strikes have become more frequent. The drones are effective both for single and mass launches which can potentially overload air defence systems.But the recent strikes on energy infrastructure that caused the blackouts in Belgorod are more likely to have involved heavier weapons. Reports say long-range Himars rockets or Morok drones with larger warheads might have been used.Head of Belgorod region press officeBelgorod has introduced mobile armed units to try to shoot down dronesAnd while for many in Russia the war still seems far away, residents of Belgorod region now feel its impact daily, like Ukrainians over the border.\"Until September, the war seemed to have faded into the background again. But now we are getting constant reminders - through power outages, fuel shortages, and a general sense of anxiety\", says Yakov, who declined to give his real name. \"I personally have a strong feeling that, by continuing the war, Russia is racing headlong toward the abyss\".Additional reporting by Ilya Abishev",
